Source Code Execution Test Suite for BusinessUnitFilter

This test suite focuses on EXECUTING actual source code paths in business_unit_filter.py
to achieve 50%+ coverage by running realistic business unit detection and filtering scenarios.

Target: Execute all major code paths in BusinessUnitFilter class for real coverage improvement.
Approach: Source code execution with realistic configurations and document filtering scenarios.
