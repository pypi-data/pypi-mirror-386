"""
Performance and load tests for AsyncMetricsService.

Tests verify that the metrics service delivers sub-millisecond latency performance
and handles high load with concurrent processing correctly.

TIMING FLEXIBILITY:
- Uses TEST_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER environment variable to scale timeouts
- Default multiplier is 2.0 to accommodate slower systems and CI environments
- All timing assertions use multiplied thresholds for reliability
