      placeholder: |
        I'm trying to write agent prompts with better type safety, but currently only JavaScript is supported.
        This makes it harder to catch errors during development.

      placeholder: |
        Add TypeScript support to the agent system:
        - Accept .ts files in .genie/agents/
        - Compile TypeScript during agent loading
        - Provide type definitions for agent context

      required: true

      label: Alternatives Considered
      description: What other approaches did you think about?
      placeholder: |
        - Using JSDoc comments (less robust)
        - External transpilation (adds complexity)
        - TypeScript-only mode (breaks compatibility)

      description: Specific scenarios where this feature helps
      placeholder: |
        As a developer building complex agents, I want type safety so that I can:
        - Catch errors before runtime
        - Get better IDE autocomplete
        - Refactor with confidence
