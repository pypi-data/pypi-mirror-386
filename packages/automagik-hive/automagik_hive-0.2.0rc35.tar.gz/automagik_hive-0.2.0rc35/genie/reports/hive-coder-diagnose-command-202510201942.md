# Death Testament: Diagnostic Command Implementation

**Agent**: hive-coder
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-20 19:42 UTC
**Scope**: Create `automagik-hive diagnose` command for installation troubleshooting
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully created a comprehensive diagnostic tool that helps users self-service troubleshoot installation and setup issues. The command performs systematic checks across all critical components and provides actionable guidance for resolution.

---

## 📋 Deliverables

### 1. Core Implementation

**Files Created:**
- `/home/cezar/automagik/automagik-hive/cli/commands/diagnose.py` - DiagnoseCommands class with 6 diagnostic checks
- `/home/cezar/automagik/automagik-hive/tests/cli/commands/test_diagnose.py` - Comprehensive test suite (26 tests, 92% coverage)

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/cezar/automagik/automagik-hive/cli/main.py` - Wired diagnose subcommand into CLI

### 2. Diagnostic Checks Implemented

The `diagnose` command performs 6 comprehensive checks:

1. **Workspace Structure** - Validates required directories (ai/agents, ai/teams, ai/workflows, knowledge)
2. **Docker Configuration** - Checks for docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, and hive-postgres service
3. **Docker Daemon** - Verifies Docker is installed and running
4. **PostgreSQL Status** - Checks if hive-postgres container exists and is running
5. **Environment Config** - Validates .env file exists with required keys (no placeholders)
6. **API Keys** - Ensures at least one AI provider key is configured

### 3. Key Features

**Actionable Error Messages:**
- Each failure includes specific "Try: ..." guidance
- Distinguishes between init vs install errors
- Lists ALL issues found (not just the first one)

**Verbose Mode:**
- Shows warnings and informational messages
- Displays which API keys were found
- Helpful for debugging edge cases

**Clean Output:**
```
🔍 Automagik Hive Diagnostic Report
==================================================

✅ Workspace Structure
❌ Docker Configuration
   • Missing: docker/main/docker-compose.yml
   • Run 'automagik-hive init' to create Docker configuration

==================================================
⚠️  Some checks failed

💡 Fix the issues above, then run:
   automagik-hive diagnose --verbose
```

---

## ✅ Validation Evidence

### Test Results
```bash
$ uv run pytest tests/cli/commands/test_diagnose.py -v
======================== 26 passed, 11 warnings in 3.36s ========================

Coverage: 92% on cli/commands/diagnose.py (10/133 lines uncovered)
```

### CLI Integration
```bash
$ uv run automagik-hive diagnose --help
usage: automagik-hive diagnose [-h] [-v] [workspace]

positional arguments:
  workspace      Workspace directory path

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  Show detailed diagnostic information
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
$ uv run automagik-hive diagnose .
# Successfully identifies missing components
# Provides clear next steps
# Returns appropriate exit codes (0=success, 1=failures)
```

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage Summary

**26 tests across 7 test classes:**

1. **TestDiagnoseCommands** (2 tests) - Initialization and defaults
2. **TestWorkspaceStructureCheck** (3 tests) - Directory validation
3. **TestDockerFilesCheck** (3 tests) - Docker config validation
4. **TestDockerDaemonCheck** (3 tests) - Docker daemon availability
5. **TestPostgresStatusCheck** (3 tests) - Container status
6. **TestEnvironmentConfigCheck** (4 tests) - .env file validation
7. **TestAPIKeysCheck** (3 tests) - Provider key detection
8. **TestDiagnoseInstallation** (5 tests) - Full diagnostic flow

All tests pass with proper mocking and environment isolation.

## 🔧 Command Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
automagik-hive diagnose [workspace]
```

### With Verbose Output
```bash
automagik-hive diagnose --verbose
```

### Check Specific Workspace
```bash
automagik-hive diagnose /path/to/workspace
```

## 🎓 Design Decisions

### 1. Test-First Development (TDD)
- Created comprehensive test suite BEFORE implementation
- Verified RED phase (tests fail due to missing module)
- Implemented to GREEN (all tests pass)
- Achieved 92% coverage

### 2. Actionable Guidance
- Every failure includes specific fix commands
- Distinguishes between "run init" vs "run install" errors
- Shows ALL issues in one pass (no iterative fixing needed)

### 3. Environment Isolation in Tests
- Properly handles environment variable mocking
- Cleans up API keys between tests
- Restores original state after each test

### 4. User Experience
- Clean, emoji-enhanced output
- Exit codes match shell conventions (0=success, 1=failure)
- Verbose mode for debugging without cluttering default output

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **Docker Checks are Basic**
   - Checks container existence/status but not deep health
   - Could be extended with connectivity tests

2. **Environment Validation**
   - Checks for placeholder values but not format validity
   - Could validate DATABASE_URL format, API_KEY patterns

3. **No Auto-Fix**
   - Only diagnoses, doesn't auto-fix issues
   - By design - safer for users to explicitly run commands

---

## 🔄 Follow-Up Opportunities

1. **Integration with Install**
   - Install command could call diagnose after setup
   - Verify all checks pass before declaring success

2. **Extended Checks**
   - Network connectivity tests
   - Port availability checks
   - Database connection validation

3. **Machine-Readable Output**
   - JSON output flag for automation/CI
   - Structured exit codes for specific failures

---

## 📊 Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: 288 (implementation) + 465 (tests) = 753 total
- **Test Coverage**: 92% on implementation
- **Tests Written**: 26 comprehensive tests
- **Test Classes**: 7 organized by check category
- **Time to Implement**: ~1 hour (including TDD workflow)

---

## 🏁 Completion Checklist

- [x] DiagnoseCommands class created with 6 check methods

# 1. Check help
uv run automagik-hive diagnose --help

# 2. Run diagnostics in automagik-hive repo
uv run automagik-hive diagnose .

# 3. Run with verbose
uv run automagik-hive diagnose . --verbose

# 4. Test in a fresh workspace
mkdir /tmp/test-workspace
uv run automagik-hive diagnose /tmp/test-workspace

# 5. Run all diagnostic tests
uv run pytest tests/cli/commands/test_diagnose.py -v
```

## 📝 Closing Notes

This diagnostic command provides users with a self-service troubleshooting tool that:
- Systematically checks all installation prerequisites
- Provides clear, actionable error messages
- Helps users fix issues without needing to understand internals
- Follows TDD best practices with comprehensive test coverage

The implementation is production-ready and can be extended with additional checks as needed. The test suite ensures reliability and makes future enhancements safe.

**All acceptance criteria met. Task complete.** ✅
