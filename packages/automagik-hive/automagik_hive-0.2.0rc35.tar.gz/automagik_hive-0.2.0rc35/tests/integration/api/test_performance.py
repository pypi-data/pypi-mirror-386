"""
Performance and load testing for the API layer.

Tests system performance under various load conditions
and validates response times and throughput.

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED:
- Reduced throughput test duration: 5s → 2s (60% reduction)
- Reduced sustained load test: 6s → 2.5s (58% reduction)
- Optimized concurrent tests: 100→60 requests, 30→20 workers
- Improved pacing algorithms for faster convergence
- Maintained performance validation accuracy while reducing CI overhead

TARGET: <8s combined for key throughput tests (40% improvement from 13.29s baseline)
