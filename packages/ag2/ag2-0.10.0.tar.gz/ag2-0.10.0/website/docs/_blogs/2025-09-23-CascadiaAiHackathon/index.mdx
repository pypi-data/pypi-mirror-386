### **Cascadia AI Hackathon Winner: Dino Park Meets AG2**

Last weekend at the Cascadia AI Hackathon in Seattle, developers showed off what's possible with multi-agent systems.

The prize for Best Use of AG2 went to Jeff Linwood, who built a dinosaur park simulation game where rangers, guests, and even the dinosaurs themselves are represented as AI agents orchestrated in a swarm.

Jeff reflected on the experience:

"I got a chance to work on some fun tech and build out a ridiculous dinosaur-themed simulation game using AI-based NPCs. I ended up winning the prize for best use of the AG2 agentic framework!"

We loved seeing AG2 power such a creative and playful project ‚Äî and we're excited to see what else the open-source community will build next.

üëè Huge congrats Jeff, and thanks to Carter Rabasa and the Cascadia AI organizers for bringing this community together.
