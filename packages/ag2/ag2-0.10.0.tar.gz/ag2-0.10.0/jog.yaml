    confidence_threshold: 80 # Joggr will only open a PR if the agent is at least 80% confident it can apply the fix correctly.

# Recommendation guidelines for setting thresholds:
# 50 → More suggestions, though some may be less relevant. Useful for public repos or docs where freshness is critical.
# 75 → Fewer suggestions, but higher quality. Best for internal repos where only significant updates matter.

# How the agent interprets confidence scores:
#  0–50   → Documentation is still valid; at most small details may have changed.
# 51-70   → Partially relevant; core ideas are still correct, but some parts may be outdated.
# 71–85   → Significant changes detected; accuracy of the documentation is questionable.
# 86–100  → Documentation is largely outdated and misleading.

# Note: The agent starts from the assumption that documentation is correct unless it finds clear evidence otherwise.
# Lower scores mean "likely still accurate," while higher scores mean "more likely outdated."
