## beta-0.47.1
##### March 12, 2025

### [Breaking Change] Feature
1. The sync command now also syncs the BYOSnap profile with the Snapend as well
    ```bash
    snapctl byosnap sync --byosnap-id byosnap-jinks-flask --path /Users/Ajinkya/Development/SnapserEngine/jinks_flask --version "$version" --snapend-id "${snapendId}" --blocking
    ```
    The only reason this constitutes a breaking change is if users of the sync command were not
    anticipating the BYOSnap profile to be checked. Now that this command also synchronizes the profile,
    you must have the BYOSnap profile located at the --path or within the --resources-path folder.
