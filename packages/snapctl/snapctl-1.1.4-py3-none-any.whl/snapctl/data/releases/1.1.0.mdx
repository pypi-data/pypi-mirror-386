## Release 1.1.0
##### Oct 13, 2025

### Deprecation Notice
1. The `Snapend` command now accepts `--application-id` for consistency with the web app. The `--game-id` parameter is still supported but will be removed in future releases.
2. The `Game` command has been renamed to `Application`. The old command is still supported but will be removed in future releases. Please use `snapctl application` instead of `snapctl game`.

### New Features
#### Snapend command
- Added a new `snapend create` command to create a new Snapend instance using a manifest file.

#### Snaps command
- Added a new `snaps enumerate` command to get a list of all available snaps for your organization, including all the metadata and dependencies.

#### Snapend Manifest commands
- We have added a new command `snapend-manifest` that enables you to create CI/CD pipelines for your Snapend manifests. The command supports the following subcommands:
  - `create`: Allows you to create a brand new manifest file by telling the command which snaps you want to include.
  - `update`: Tells the snapctl to update your manifest file with a set of snaps and features. These are synced with the manifest file you pass.
  - `upgrade`: Tells snapctl to upgrade all the snaps in the manifest or selected snaps to their latest versions.
