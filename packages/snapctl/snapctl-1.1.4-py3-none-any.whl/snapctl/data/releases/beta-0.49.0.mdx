### Breaking Change
1. Renamed SDK type `server` to `api-key` to be consistent with the Snapser Web app.

### Bug Fixes
1. The `snapctl byosnap generate-profile` command was not working when outside the root snapctl folder. This is now fixed.
2. The `snapctl release-notes` commands were not working when outside the root snapctl folder. This is now fixed.
