## beta-0.48.0
##### April 11, 2025

### Features
1. Dockerfile can now be present either at the root or the resources path. Snapctl will automatically look for the Dockerfile in both locations.
2. Snapctl now throws a better warning when the swagger for the BYOSnap is not compatible with what the Snapser backed expects. You will get a warning message:
```bash
Warning Snapser enforces a strict schema for the swagger.json file. It needs to be a valid OpenAPI 3.0 spec. In addition, ever API needs an operationId. a summary and
a non-empty description. This allows Snapser to generate your SDK and power the API explorer. If you do not wish to leverage this feature, just remove the
swagger.json file.
```
3. You can now use the `--skip-build` flag with the snapctl sync command. This allows you to skip the build step when syncing your Snapend resources.
```bash
byosnap sync --snapend-id $snapendId --byosnap-id $byosnapId --version $version --path $path --skip-build
```

### Fixes
1. Snapctl was failing if the user passed in a tag with a `:` in it. This has been fixed. It now checks for the presence of a `:` in the tag and throws an error in the input validation step.
2. The byosnap generate command was failing. This has been fixed.
