## beta-0.50.0
##### June 5, 2025

### Bug fix
- Success, info or warning messages were sometimes getting truncated in the CLI output. This has been fixed.
- Snapctl byosnap and byogs now support features that could only work with Buildkit.

### Feature
- The `snapctl byosnap upload-docs` command now supports `--version` to keep it consistent with all the new commands like `sync` and `publish`.
