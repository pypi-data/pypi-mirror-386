## Release 1.1.4
##### Oct 24, 2025

### Features
1. We added SDK support for `flutter-dart` and `dart`. You can download SDKs using the `snapend download` command.

### Fixes
1. Snapend-Manifest create, update, upgrade and sync was adding some extra fields in the `data_definitions` (this was already backward compatible, but still unnecessary). This has been fixed.
2. Snapend-manifest sync, update, upgrade now validate if the manifest file is a valid.
3. Snapend creation failures due to duplicate cluster names now show proper error messages.
4. Snapend download command now smartly picks a default `http-lib` if the user does not provide one, based on the SDK selected.

### Documentation
1. Updated the README.md to reflect correct parameter names for commands.
