Skeleton State Backend for PyMomentum

This module provides efficient forward kinematics and skinning operations using
the skeleton state representation (8 parameters per joint: translation, quaternion, scale).

The skeleton state representation is more compact than the TRS backend and uses
quaternions for rotation, making it suitable for applications requiring smooth
interpolation and fewer parameters.

Performance Notes:
This backend matches the behavior of the C++ Momentum code, ensuring consistency
with the reference implementation. However, the TRS backend may be 25-50% faster
in PyTorch due to not requiring quaternion normalization operations, though the
exact performance difference may vary depending on the specific use case.

Key Functions:
- global_skel_state_from_local_skel_state: Forward kinematics from local to global joint states
- skin_points_from_skel_state: Linear blend skinning using skeleton states
- local_skel_state_from_joint_params: Convert joint parameters to local states

Related Modules:
- trs_backend: Alternative backend using separate translation/rotation/scale tensors
- skel_state: Core skeleton state operations and utilities
- quaternion: Quaternion math operations used by this backend

    Convert joint parameters to local skeleton state representation.

    This function transforms 7-parameter joint representation (translation, euler angles, log-scale)
    into the 8-parameter skeleton state format (translation, quaternion, scale). The skeleton state
    representation uses quaternions for rotation and linear scale factors.

    Parameter Transformation:
    - Translation: joint_params[:,:,:3] + joint_offset -> direct translation
    - Rotation: euler_xyz angles -> quaternion, composed with joint pre-rotation
    - Scale: log2(scale) -> linear scale via exp2() transformation

            Each joint contains [tx, ty, tz, qx, qy, qz, qw, s] parameters.

    Compute global skeleton state from local joint transformations using forward kinematics.

    This function implements forward kinematics (FK) using prefix multiplication for efficient
    parallel computation of joint transformations. Each joint's local transformation is composed
    with its parent's global transformation to produce the joint's global transformation.

    The skeleton state uses an 8-parameter representation per joint: [translation, quaternion, scale]

    - quaternion (4D): rotation quaternion [qx, qy, qz, qw] (normalized)

    Forward Kinematics Algorithm:
    For each joint j with parent p in the kinematic hierarchy:
        global_state_j = global_state_p ⊙ local_state_j

    Where ⊙ represents similarity transformation composition:
    - t_global = t_parent + s_parent * rotate_by_quaternion(q_parent, t_local)

    - s_global = s_parent * s_local
