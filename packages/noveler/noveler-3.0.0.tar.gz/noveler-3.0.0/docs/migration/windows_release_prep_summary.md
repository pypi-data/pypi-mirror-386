# Windows Release Prep Summary

## Scope
- Capture Windows / WSL cross-platform milestones completed in Phases 0–2.
- Highlight residual risks and mitigation owners before rolling out to a broader Windows audience.
- Provide quick references to onboarding and feedback procedures.

## Completed Work
- Platform detection utilities unified with `src/noveler/infrastructure/utils/platform.py`.
- Cross-environment runners exposed via `bin/invoke`, `bin/test`, PowerShell wrappers, and `scripts/tooling/test_runner.py`.
- Diagnostics suite (`scripts/diagnostics/check_env.py`, `bin/invoke diagnose`) and Git helpers (`bin/git-noveler*`, `scripts/diagnostics/run_smoke_suite.py`) delivered.
- Documentation refreshed across README, migration guides, and Windows tooling guide.

## Release Goals
1. Ensure Windows-only installations can clone, run `bin/invoke test-smoke`, and commit locally.
2. Guarantee support docs cover Remote-WSL and Windows-local Git setup alternatives.
3. Establish checkpoints for collecting feedback during the staggered rollout.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Description | Mitigation Owner |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Git misconfiguration | Working tree points to WSL-only bare repo, breaking Windows Git | Provide local clone instructions & verification script (`bin/git-noveler.ps1 status`) |
| Missing Python dependencies | Windows smoke suite fails due to optional packages | Document pre-flight checklist in onboarding; add `pip install -r requirements/windows.txt` step |
| OneDrive file locks | Git status or smoke suite blocked by sync | Recommend excluding `.git` and `reports/` from OneDrive or pausing sync during smoke |

## Staged Rollout
1. **Pilot (Week 1)** – Internal Windows users follow onboarding checklist, report via GitHub issue template `Release-Windows`.
2. **Feedback Review (Week 2)** – Aggregate smoke results stored in `reports/smoke/` and evaluate blocking issues.
3. **Public Availability (Week 3)** – Publish Windows instructions in README, announce in Discord #updates channel.
