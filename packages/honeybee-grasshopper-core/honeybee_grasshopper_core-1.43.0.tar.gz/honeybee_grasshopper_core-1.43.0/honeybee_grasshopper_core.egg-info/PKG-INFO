# honeybee-grasshopper-core

:honeybee: :green_book: Core Honeybee plugin for Grasshopper (aka. honeybee[+]).

(aka. those components that are shared across all extensions). The package includes
both the userobjects (`.ghuser`) and the Python source (`.py`). Note that this
library only possesses the Grasshopper components and, in order to run the plugin,
the core libraries must be installed (see dependencies).
