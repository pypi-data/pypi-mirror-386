    Voltage Divider Constraints

    This type encapsulates the necessary parameters for the
    solver as well as other logistics parameters for the generated result.

    This type solves the "forward" voltage divider problem. Meaning that the
    input voltage is the `hi` side of the voltage divider and the objective
    voltage we are solving for is the middle node of the voltage divider (`out`).

    This type of solve might be used when building an attenuator where we want
    to keep the output within some toleranced range.

    Args:
        v_in: Input Voltage Range
              This parameter encodes the typical DC voltage
              range for the input.
        v_out: Desired Voltage Output Range
               Construct a voltage divider such that the specified
               input voltage results in a output voltage in this range.
        current: Max current in amps allowed through the divider
        prec_series: Set of precision series to search
                     By default, we search the following series: [0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.005, 0.0025, 0.001]
                     The user can customize this series by pass an overriding series.
        search_range: Set the search range for components to select
                      This algorithm does a pre-screening of resistor values based on
                      the `v-in`, `v-out`, and `current` parameters. Then this
                      parameter limits how far from these pre-screen values we're willing
                      to search to find an acceptable solution.
        min_sources: Set the minimum number of sources
                     When pulling resistors from the database, this algorithm will
                     limit the selection of resistors to only those components
                     for which there are at least `min-sources` number of manufacturers
                     for comparable parts.
                     By default this value is 3.
        query_limit: Query Limiter for Results.
                     For many resistors, there may be 1000's of parts that
                     match a particular query. This parameter limits the
                     number of returned results to some max so as not to
                     overload the parts database. The default value is 50.
                     This value must be greater than the `min-sources`
                     parameter.
        temp_range: Temperature Range for TCR evaluation.
                    Default is 0.0 to 25.0 C.
        base_query: Base ResistorQuery
                    This object allows the user to further fine tune the
                    selected resistors as part of the solver. The global
                    design level defaults will still apply but this can
                    be used to override or add to the query parameters.
                    The `resistance`, `tolerance`, or `precision` keys
                    will be overridden by the solvers so any value
                    in the base query will be ignored for those keys.
