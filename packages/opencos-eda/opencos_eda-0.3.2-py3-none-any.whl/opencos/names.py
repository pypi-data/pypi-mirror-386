''' names.py

This is a human-maintained but ideally machine parsable mapping of names

Where convenient, this file should be parsed versus embedding names in code,
which is what oc_cli.py does.

Once assigned, names are not changed, so it's OK to use: `define OC_VENDOR 1
to indicate Xilinx in some RTL code.  There doesn't yet seem to be cause to
bring in automation to create SystemVerilog defines and such, as each board
just needs to set a couple of these statically.

all values in this file are in hex.
