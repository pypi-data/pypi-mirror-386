# Non .sv, .v, .vhd, .cpp files can go directly in the
# 'deps', for example .mem, .pcap files:
foo_test:
  deps:
    - foo.sv
    - some_mem.mem
  top: foo

# These can also go in 'reqs':
foo_test2:
  deps:
    - foo.sv
  reqs:
    - some_mem.mem
  top: foo

# Included files can also go this route. For example,
# +incdir+. is always present, so you can call included files with reqs and not incdirs
foo_test3:
  deps:
    - foo_with_include.sv
  reqs:
    - foo_include.svh  # checked for file existence, no incdirs, defaulting to incdir=.
    - some_mem.mem
  top: foo_with_include

# You can still include files without reqs
foo_test4:
  deps:
    - foo_with_include.sv
  incdirs: . # pick up foo_include.svh this way, omit from reqs.
  reqs:
    - some_mem.mem
