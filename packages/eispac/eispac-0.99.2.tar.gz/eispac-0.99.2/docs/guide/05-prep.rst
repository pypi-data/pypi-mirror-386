Level-1 HDF5 File Processing
============================

This chapter describes in more detail how the EIS level-1 HDF5 files
were processed and saved. These HDF5 files can be downloaded from
https://eis.nrl.navy.mil/ or by using the search & download
functionality of EISPAC (see the section on :ref:`sec-download`).

Prepping the Data in IDL
------------------------

The level-0 fits files were prepped using the IDL routine ``eis_prep``
available via SolarSoft [#]_ with the following options:

::

     default = 1
     save = 1
     quiet = 1
     retain = 1
     photons = 1
     refill = 0

There are 400,000+ EIS level-0 files at present, but on a multi-core
machine using the IDL bridge all of the files can be prepped in under 24
hours. We have prepped all of the available EIS files and saved them to
standard fits files in the usual way. Some important points:

* *units* - As mentioned previously, the units for the output in these level-1
  files is “photon events” or “counts.” This means that the statistical
  uncertainty can usually be estimated as :math:`\sqrt{N}`. When EISPAC
  loads the HDF5 files, it also calculates an estimate for the read
  noise contribution. It should be noted, however, that the read noise
  becomes significant only at very low flux levels (1–2 counts).

* *retain* - Note that the retain keyword preserves negative values. One of
  the jobs of ``eis_prep`` is to remove the pedestal from the CCD readout
  and any time-dependent dark current. Since the spectral windows are
  generally narrow, the estimate of the background can be too high and
  the subtracted intensities of the continuum can be negative. This
  will be dealt with during the fitting.

* *refill* - The warm pixel problem complicates the fitting of EIS line
  profiles. As discussed in the EIS software note #13 (found in SSW or on the
  `MSSL EIS Wiki <http://solarb.mssl.ucl.ac.uk:8080/eiswiki/Wiki.jsp?page=EISAnalysisGuide#section-EISAnalysisGuide-EISSoftwareNotes>`_),
  interpolating the values of missing pixels appears to best reproduce
  the original data. This option is left off during ``eis_prep`` so that
  the level-1 fits file preserves the information on the missing pixels.
  As discussed below, the interpolation (via the refill option) is done
  during the read and this data is ultimately written to the HDF5 file.
  A mask indicating which pixels have been interpolated will be added to
  the HDF5 files in a future revision.

Here is an IDL code snippet related to reading the data by looping over
the spectral windows.

.. code:: idl

   for iwin=0, nwin-1 do begin
     d = eis_getwindata(eis_level1_filename, iwin, /refill, /quiet)
     eis_level1_data[iwin] = ptr_new(d)
   endfor

Writing the HDF5 Files
----------------------

Each processed level-1 fits file was bundled up with the associated
calibration and metadata and saved as a pair of two HDF5 files:

* **eis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.data.h5** - Contains only the corrected photon counts
  within each spectral window. This is, by far, the larger of the two HDF5
  files. However, they should not need to be updated or downloaded very often.

* **eis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.head.h5** - Contains the original fit file index,
  calibration curves for each spectral window (used to convert counts into
  intensity values), and the corrected pointing information.

Internal Structure
------------------

Users will rarely, if ever, need to access the information inside the
HDF5 files directly. EISPAC contains all of the functions needed to read
the data and apply the calibration and pointing corrections.
Nevertheless, the contents and data structure of the HDF5 files are
summarized below.

Data Files (*.data.h5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **level1** (group)

   - **intensity_units** (dataset) - String with the level1 data units.
     This will usually be "counts"

   - **win##** (dataset) - array of floating point values with the photon
     counts in a given spectral window (e.g. ``win00, win01, ... win24``).
     Note well, each set of EIS observations may have a different
     number of spectral windows, up to a maximum of 24 windows. Window
     numbers are numbered sequentially from 00; a given wavelength
     range may be assigned a different window number in each EIS study.

Header Files (*.head.h5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **ccd_offsets** (group)

   - **win##** (dataset) - array of CCD pointing offsets (in units of [arcsec]
     along the Solar-Y axis) for each wavelength value observed in a given
     spectral window. Computed in IDL using the function ``eis_ccd_offset``.
     While the offset technically varies with wavelength, the difference
     within a single window is on the order of 0.05 arcsec. Therefore, the
     mean CCD offset within a window is commonly used.

- **exposure_times** (group)

   - **duration** (dataset) - array of exposure times for each raster
     position within the EIS observation

   - **duration_units** (string) - units of exposure times (usually "seconds").

- **index** (group) - complete FITS header from the original level-0
  EIS data file.

- **instrumental_broadening** (group)

   - **slit_width** (dataset) - array of widths along the EIS slit, as
     computed by the IDL function ``eis_slit_width``.

   - **slit_width_units** (string) - units of slit width (usually "Angstroms").

- **pointing** (group) - various arrays and reference values needed for
  correcting and updating the pointing values. Subarrays and values included:
  fovx, fovy, offset_x, offset_y, ref_time, solar_x, solar_y, x_scale, xcen,
  y_scale, & ycen.

- **radcal** (group)

   - **win##_pre** (dataset) - Pre-flight radiometric calibration curve for
     each spectral window in the observation.

- **times** (group)

   - **date_obs** (dataset) - array of starting timestamps for each
     raster position in the EIS observation.

   - **time_format** (string) - format code for the timestamps ("iso_8601").

- **wavelength** (group)

   - **wave_corr** (dataset) - combined array of wave correction factors
     due to all orbital and instrumental effects (see below).

   - **wave_corr_t** (dataset) - array of wave correction factors due to
     the orbital motion and instrument temperature. This is computed using
     the ``hkwavecorr`` method in IDL.

   - **wave_corr_tilt** (dataset) - array of wave correction factors due to
     the tilt EIS slit relative to the orientation of the CCD.

   - **win##** (dataset) - *uncorrected* wavelength arrays for each spectral
     window in the observation (in units of [Angstrom]).

- **wininfo** (group)

   - **nwin** (integer) - number of spectral windows in the EIS observation

   - **win##** (group) - dictionary of window information for a given spectral
     window. Values included: iwin, line_id, nl, wvl_max, wvl_min, xs.

The contents of the HDF5 files can be displayed using the ``h5dump`` command
line tool, which is provided along with the Anaconda Python distribution
platform or can be installed on its own. Example usage,

::

   > h5dump -n eis_20190404_131513.data.h5
   FILE_CONTENTS {
   group      /
   group      /level1
   dataset    /level1/intensity_units
   dataset    /level1/win00
   dataset    /level1/win01
   dataset    /level1/win02
   dataset    /level1/win03
   dataset    /level1/win04
   dataset    /level1/win05
   . . .

The actual data associated with each variable can be printed out using
the ``-d`` option. For example,

::

   > h5dump -d exposure_times/duration eis_20190404_131513.head.h5
   HDF5 "eis_20190404_131513.head.h5" {
   DATASET "exposure_times/duration" {
      DATATYPE  H5T_IEEE_F32LE
      DATASPACE  SIMPLE { ( 87 ) / ( 87 ) }
      DATA {
      (0): 40.0005, 40.0002, 40.0004, 40.0004, 39.9994, 40.0002, 39.9995, 40,
      (8): 40.0007, 39.9999, 40.0005, 40.0004, 39.9997, 40.0002, 39.9994,
      . . .
   }
