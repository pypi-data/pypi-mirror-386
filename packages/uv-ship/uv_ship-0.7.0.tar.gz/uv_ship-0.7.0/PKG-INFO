# uv-ship
a CLI-tool for shipping with uv

`uv-ship` is a lightweight companion to [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) that removes the risky parts of cutting a release. It verifies the repo state, bumps your project metadata and optionally refreshes the changelog. It then commits, tags & pushes the result, while giving you the chance to review every step.

please refer to the [docs](https://floraths.github.io/uv-ship/) to get started
