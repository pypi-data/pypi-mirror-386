# Developing

You have two options for setting up a development environment: using Docker or
setting up a local environment with `uv`.

## With docker

You can use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image for development.

```console
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t sphinx-icore-open .

# Run a container with the image, mounting the current directory
docker run -p 8000:8000 -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app sphinx-icore-open
```

## With uv

For the sphinx theme developmen Make sure you have
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. You will also need
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to build the static assets.

### Setting Up the Environment

To set up a development environment:

```console
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install development dependencies
uv pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Building Static Assets

The theme's static assets (CSS, JavaScript) are built using Node.js tools.
Install the necessary Node.js dependencies by running:

```console
npm install
```

To update the changes made to the static files, run:

```console
npm run build
```

## Testing the Theme

You can test the theme using `sphinx-autobuild` to serve the documentation
locally with live reloading.

```console
# First activate the virtual environment if not already active
source .venv/bin/activate

# To start a local server with live reloading, run:
sphinx-autobuild docs/source docs/build/html

# Deactivate the virtual environment when done
deactivate
```
