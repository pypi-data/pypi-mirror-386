class Version():
    """The version of an entity.

    An entity version has a version id (string), a date (UTC timestamp), a
    list of predecessors and a list of successors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id : str, optional
        See attribute `id`. Default: None
    date : str, optional
        See attribute `date`. Default: None
    username : str, optional
        See attribute `username`. Default: None
    realm : str, optional
        See attribute `realm`. Default: None
    predecessors : list of Version, optional
        See attribute `predecessors`. Default: empty list.
    successors : list of Version, optional
        See attribute `successors`. Default: empty list.
    is_head : bool
        See attribute `is_head`. Default: False
    is_complete_history : bool
        See attribute `is_complete_history`. Default: False

    Attributes
    ----------
    id : str
        Version ID (not the entity's id).
    date : str
        UTC Timestamp of the version, i.e. the date and time when the entity of
        this version has been inserted or modified.
    username : str
        The username of the user who inserted or updated this version.
    realm : str
        The realm of the user who inserted or updated this version.
    predecessors : list of Version
        Predecessors are the older entity versions which have been modified
        into this version. Usually, there is only one predecessor. However,
        this API allows for entities to be merged into one entity, which would
        result in more than one predecessor.
    successors : list of Version
        Successors are newer versions of this entity. If there are successors,
        this version is not the latest version of this entity. Usually, there
        is only one successor. However, this API allows that a single entity
        may co-exist in several versions (e.g. several proposals for the next
        entity status). That would result in more than one successor.
    is_head : bool or string
        If true, this indicates that this version is the HEAD if true.
        Otherwise it is not known whether this is the head or not.  Any string
        matching "true" (case-insensitively) is regarded as True.
        Nota bene: This property should typically be set if the server response
        indicated that this is the head version.
    is_complete_history : bool or string
        If true, this indicates that this version contains the full version
        history. That means, that the predecessors and successors have their
        respective predecessors and successors attached as well and the tree is
        completely available.  Any string matching "true" (case-insensitively)
        is regarded as True.
        Nota bene: This property should typically be set if the server response
        indicated that the full version history is included in its response.
