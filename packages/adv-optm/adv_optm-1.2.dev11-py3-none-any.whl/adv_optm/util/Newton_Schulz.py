    Performs the Newton-Schulz iteration to find the nearest orthogonal matrix.
    This is the core computation of the Muon optimizer.

        G (torch.Tensor): The 2D input matrix (momentum-accumulated gradient).
        steps (int): The number of iterations to run.
        eps (float): Small constant for numerical stability during normalization.
        coeffs (tuple[float, float, float]): The (a, b, c) coefficients for the
