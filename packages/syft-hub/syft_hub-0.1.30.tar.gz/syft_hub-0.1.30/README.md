# Syft Hub SDK

**Build Federated RAG and tap into distributed data sources without centralizing knowledge.**

LLMs often fail on domain-specific questions, not from lack of capability, but from missing access to expert data. RAG extends their reach with external context, but only if you already own the data.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Federated RAG

```python
from syft_hub import Client

client = Client()

# Choose data sources from the network
hacker_news_source = client.load_service("demo@openmined.org/hacker-news")
arxiv_source = client.load_service("demo@openmined.org/arxiv-agents")
github_source = client.load_service("demo@openmined.org/trending-github")

# Choose an LLM to synthesize insights
claude_llm = client.load_service("aggregator@openmined.org/claude-3.5-sonnet")

# Create a Federated RAG pipeline
fedrag_pipeline = client.pipeline(
    data_sources=[hacker_news_source, arxiv_source, github_source],
    synthesizer=claude_llm
)

# Run your query across the network
query = "What methods can help improve context in LLM agents?"
result = fedrag_pipeline.run(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}])

print(result)
```

**What just happened?**
- Each data source was queried **on its own infrastructure** (no data centralization)
- Only relevant snippets were retrieved and shared
- The LLM synthesized insights from multiple sources into one answer
- Data owners maintained full control and privacy

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install syft-hub
```

**For Jupyter/Colab:** Make sure Syft runtime is available:

```python
!pip install syfthub syft-installer
import syft_installer as si

# Make sure Syft runtime is running
si.install_and_run_if_needed()
```

**Outside Jupyter/Colab:** Donwload and run distributed protocol, [SyftBox](syftbox.net).

## üí° Why Federated RAG?

Traditional approaches to domain-specific AI have a fundamental flaw: **data owners must hand over their raw data and lose control**. This introduces legal, privacy, and intellectual property risks.

**The result?** Most organizations say no, and AI stays limited to public training data.

**Federated RAG solves this** by letting AI "walk the halls" and consult distributed data sources without centralizing knowledge:
- üîí **Privacy-preserving**: Data stays where it belongs
- üåê **Distributed**: Query multiple sources in one pipeline
- ‚ö° **Selective sharing**: Only relevant snippets are returned
- üéØ **Domain expertise**: Access specialized knowledge networks

Think of it like a student gathering input from multiple teachers (biology, law, ethics professors) rather than studying alone‚Äîthe result is far richer.

---

## üéØ Core Concepts

### 1. **Data Sources**
Data sources are federated peers that own their data. They don't ship it to you ‚Äî you query them at runtime.

```python
# Load data sources from the network
hacker_news = client.load_service("demo@openmined.org/hacker-news")
arxiv_papers = client.load_service("demo@openmined.org/arxiv-agents")
```

### 2. **Synthesizers (LLMs)**
Synthesizers take insights from multiple data sources and combine them into coherent answers.

```python
# Load an LLM for generation
claude = client.load_service("aggregator@openmined.org/claude-3.5-sonnet")
```

### 3. **Pipelines**
Pipelines orchestrate federated queries across data sources and route results to synthesizers.

```python
# Create a pipeline
pipeline = client.pipeline(
    data_sources=[source1, source2, source3],
    synthesizer=llm
)

# Run queries
result = pipeline.run(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your question"}])
```

---

## üåê How It Works

1. **Distributed Indexing**: Each data source maintains its own private index (embeddings of their documents)
2. **Federated Query**: When you run a pipeline, your query is broadcast to selected data sources
3. **Local Retrieval**: Each source searches its own index and returns only the top-k most relevant snippets
4. **Aggregation**: The pipeline collects all snippets and ranks them globally
5. **Synthesis**: The LLM receives the best snippets and generates a grounded answer

**Key insight:** Raw data never leaves the source. Only relevant snippets are shared based on semantic similarity to your query.

## üìö Examples

### Example 1: Multi-Source Domain Expertise

Query specialized knowledge across different domains:

```python
from syft_hub import Client

client = Client()

# Load domain-specific sources
medical_db = client.load_service("<medical_institution>/medical-research")
pharma_trials = client.load_service("<pharma_company>/clinical-trials")
patient_notes = client.load_service("<hospital_X>/doctor-notes")

# Load synthesizer
gpt4 = client.load_service("aggregator@openmined.org/gpt-4")

# Create pipeline
medical_rag = client.pipeline(
    data_sources=[medical_db, pharma_trials, patient_notes],
    synthesizer=gpt4
)

# Ask domain-specific questions
query = "Is drug X safe for diabetes patients with kidney disease?"
answer = medical_rag.run(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}])

print(answer)
```

### Example 2: Single Source RAG

Not every use case needs multiple sources:

```python
# Query a single specialized source
company_docs = client.load_service("yourcompany@example.com/internal-docs")
assistant = client.load_service("aggregator@openmined.org/claude-3.5-sonnet")

rag_pipeline = client.pipeline(
    data_sources=[company_docs],
    synthesizer=assistant
)

result = rag_pipeline.run(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's our remote work policy?"}]
)
```---

## üîç Service Discovery

Discover available data sources and LLMs on the network:

```python
# List all services
client.list_services()

# List services by type
chat_services = client.list_services(
    service_type="chat",
    tags=["opensource"],
    max_cost=0.10
)

search_services = client.list_services(
    service_type="search",
    datasite="yourcompany@example.com"
)
```

---

## üí∞ Setup accounting for paid models

**Each new user received $20 upon registration (but hey, most are anyway free!)**

Preview and manage costs for federated queries:

```python
# Setup accounting for paid services
await client.register_accounting(
    email="your@email.com",
    password="your_password"
)

# Check account balance
info = await client.get_account_info()
print(f"Balance: ${info['balance']}")

# Get cost estimate for multi-source RAG
estimate = pipeline.estimate_cost()
```

---

## üè• Health Monitoring

Monitor service availability and performance:

```python
# Check single service health
status = await client.check_service_health("service-name", timeout=5.0)

# Start continuous monitoring
monitor = client.start_health_monitoring(
    services=["service1", "service2"],
    check_interval=30.0
)
```
