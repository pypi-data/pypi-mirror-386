## Usage

Let's try to search a document in our knowledge base and look through the results:

```python
from outline_wiki_api import OutlineWiki

OUTLINE_URL = "https://my.outline.com"
OUTLINE_TOKEN = "mysecrettoken"

app = OutlineWiki(url=OUTLINE_URL, token=OUTLINE_TOKEN)

search_results = app.documents.search(query='outline').data

for result in search_results:
    print(f"document_title: {result.document.title} | "
          f"ranking: {result.ranking} | "
          f"context: {result.context[0:20].replace('\n', ' ')}\n")
```
