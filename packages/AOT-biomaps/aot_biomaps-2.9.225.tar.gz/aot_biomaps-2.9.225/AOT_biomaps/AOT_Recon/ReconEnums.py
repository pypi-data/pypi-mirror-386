    - Denominator threshold: Sets the threshold of the data space denominator under which the ratio is set to 1.

    This optimizer implements the standard Landweber algorithm for least-squares optimization.
    With transmission data, it uses the log-converted model to derive the update.
    Be aware that the relaxation parameter is not automatically set, so it often requires some

    - Initial image value: Sets the uniform voxel value for the initial image.
    - Relaxation factor: Sets the relaxation factor applied to the update.

    Options (in order when provided as a list):

    This optimizer is the NEGML algorithm from K. Van Slambrouck et al, IEEE TMI, Jan 2015, vol. 34, pp. 126-136.

    Subsets can be used. This implementation only considers the psi parameter, but not the alpha image design parameter,
    which is supposed to be 1 for all voxels. It implements equation 17 of the reference paper.

    This algorithm allows for negative image values.

    Options (in order when provided as a list):
    - Initial image value: Sets the uniform voxel value for the initial image.
    - Psi: Sets the psi parameter that sets the transition from Poisson to Gaussian statistics (must be positive).
      (If set to 0, then it is taken to infinity and implements equation 21 in the reference paper).

    This optimizer is only compatible with histogram data and emission data.
    """

    OSL = 'OSL'
    """
    This optimizer is the One-Step-Late algorithm from P. J. Green, IEEE TMI, Mar 1990, vol. 9, pp. 84-93.

    Subsets can be used as for OSEM. It accepts penalty terms that have a derivative order of at least one.
    Without penalty, it is strictly equivalent to the MLEM algorithm.

    It is numerically implemented in the multiplicative form (as opposed to the gradient form).

    Options (in order when provided as a list):
    - Initial image value: Sets the uniform voxel value for the initial image.
    - Denominator threshold: Sets the threshold of the data space denominator under which the ratio is set to 1.

    """

    PPGMLEM = 'PPGML'
    """
    This optimizer is the Penalized Preconditioned Gradient algorithm from J. Nuyts et al, IEEE TNS, Feb 2002, vol. 49, pp. 56-60.

    It is a heuristic but effective gradient ascent algorithm for penalized maximum-likelihood reconstruction.
    It addresses the shortcoming of One-Step-Late when large penalty strengths can create numerical problems.
    Penalty terms must have a derivative order of at least two.

    Subsets can be used as for OSEM. Without penalty, it is equivalent to the gradient ascent form of the MLEM algorithm.

    Based on likelihood gradient and penalty, a multiplicative update factor is computed and its range is limited by provided parameters.
    Thus, negative values cannot occur and voxels cannot be trapped into 0 values, providing the first estimate is strictly positive.

    Options (in order when provided as a list):
    - Initial image value: Sets the uniform voxel value for the initial image.
    - Denominator threshold: Sets the threshold of the data space denominator under which the ratio is set to 1.
    - Minimum image update: Sets the minimum of the image update factor under which it stays constant (0 or a negative value
                            means no minimum thus allowing a 0 update).
    - Maximum image update: Sets the maximum of the image update factor over which it stays constant (0 or a negative value means
                            no maximum).

    This optimizer is only compatible with histogram data and emission data.
    """

    AML = 'AML'
    """
    This optimizer is the AML algorithm derived from the AB-EMML of C. Byrne, Inverse Problems, 1998, vol. 14, pp. 1455-67.

    The bound B is taken to infinity, so only the bound A can be parameterized.
    This bound must be quantitative (same unit as the reconstructed image).
    It is provided as a single value and thus assuming a uniform bound.

    This algorithm allows for negative image values in case the provided bound is also negative.

    Subsets can be used.

    With a negative or null bound, this algorithm implements equation 6 of A. Rahmim et al, Phys. Med. Biol., 2012, vol. 57, pp. 733-55.
    If a positive bound is provided, then we suppose that the bound A is taken to minus infinity. In that case, this algorithm implements
    equation 22 of K. Van Slambrouck et al, IEEE TMI, Jan 2015, vol. 34, pp. 126-136.

    Options (in order when provided as a list):
    - Initial image value: Sets the uniform voxel value for the initial image.
    - Denominator threshold: Sets the threshold of the data space denominator under which the ratio is set to 1.
    - Bound: Sets the bound parameter that shifts the Poisson law (quantitative, negative or null for standard AML and positive for infinite AML).

    This optimizer is only compatible with histogram data and emission data.
    """

    BSREM = 'BSREM'
    """
    This optimizer is the BSREM (for Block Sequential Regularized Expectation Maximization) algorithm, in development.
    It follows the definition of BSREM II in Ahn and Fessler 2003.

    This optimizer is the Block Sequential Regularized Expectation Maximization (BSREM) algorithm from S. Ahn and
    J. Fessler, IEEE TMI, May 2003, vol. 22, pp. 613-626. Its abbreviated name in this paper is BSREM-II.

    This algorithm is the only one to have proven convergence using subsets. Its implementation is entirely based
    on the reference paper. It may have numerical problems when a full field-of-view is used, because of the sharp
    sensitivity loss at the edges of the field-of-view. As it is simply based on the gradient, penalty terms must
    have a derivative order of at least one. Without penalty, it reduces to OSEM but where the sensitivity is not
    dependent on the current subset. This is a requirement of the algorithm, explaining why it starts by computing
    the global sensitivity before going through iterations. The algorithm is restricted to histograms.

    Options:
    - Initial image value: Sets the uniform voxel value for the initial image.
    - Minimum image value: Sets the minimum allowed image value (parameter 't' in the reference paper).
    - Maximum image value: Sets the maximum allowed image value (parameter 'U' in the reference paper).
    - Relaxation factor type: Type of relaxation factors (can be one of the following: 'classic').

    Relaxation factors of type 'classic' correspond to what was proposed in the reference paper in equation (31).
    This equation gives: alpha_n = alpha_0 / (gamma * iter_num + 1)
    The iteration number 'iter_num' is supposed to start at 0 so that for the first iteration, alpha_0 is used.
    This parameter can be provided using the following keyword: 'relaxation factor classic initial value'.
    The 'gamma' parameter can be provided using the following keyword: 'relaxation factor classic step size'.

    This optimizer is only compatible with histogram data and emission data.
    """

    DEPIERRO95 = 'DEPIERRO95'
    """
    This optimizer is based on the algorithm from A. De Pierro, IEEE TMI, vol. 14, pp. 132-137, 1995.

    This algorithm uses optimization transfer techniques to derive an exact and convergent algorithm
    for maximum likelihood reconstruction including a MRF penalty with different potential functions.

    The algorithm is convergent and is numerically robust to high penalty strength.
    It is strictly equivalent to MLEM without penalty, but can be unstable with extremely low penalty strength.
    Currently, it only implements the quadratic penalty.

    To be used, a MRF penalty still needs to be defined accordingly (at least to define the neighborhood).
    Subsets can be used as for OSEM, without proof of convergence however.

    The algorithm is compatible with list-mode or histogram data.

    Options (in order when provided as a list):
    - Initial image value: Sets the uniform voxel value for the initial image.
    - Denominator threshold: Sets the threshold of the data space denominator under which the ratio is set to 1.
    - Minimum image update: Sets the minimum of the image update factor under which it stays constant (0 or a negative value
                            means no minimum thus allowing a 0 update).
    - Maximum image update: Sets the maximum of the image update factor over which it stays constant (0 or a negative value means
                            no maximum).

    This optimizer is compatible with both histogram and list-mode data, and only with emission data.
