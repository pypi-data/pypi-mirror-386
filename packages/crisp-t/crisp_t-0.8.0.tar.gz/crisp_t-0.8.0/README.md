**TL;DR** üöÄ *CRISP-T is a qualitative research method and a toolkit to perform textual (e.g. topic modelling) and numeric (e.g. decision trees) analysis of mixed datasets for computational triangulation and sense-making using large language models.* üëâ [See Demo](/notes/DEMO.md).

  ‚úÖ CRISP is written in Python, but **you don‚Äôt need to know Python** to use it!

  ‚úÖ CRISP is not a data science tool; it‚Äôs a **sense-making** tool!

  ‚úÖ CRISP does not replace your analysis; it just **augments** it!

  ‚úÖ CRISP employs an **interpretivist approach**, and the same lens is required to comprehend its results!

  ‚úÖ CRISP does not need LLMs but can augment them with **tools**!

  ‚úÖ CRISP is designed to **simplify your life as a qualitative researcher!**

  üíØ CRISP is open-source! licensed under the GPL-3.0 License.


**Qualitative research** focuses on collecting and analyzing textual data‚Äîsuch as interview transcripts, open-ended survey responses, and field notes‚Äîto explore complex phenomena and human experiences. Researchers may also incorporate quantitative or external sources (e.g., demographics, census data, social media) to provide context and triangulate findings. Characterized by an inductive approach, qualitative research emphasizes generating theories from data rather than testing hypotheses. While qualitative and quantitative data are often used together, there is **no standard method for combining them.**

**CRISP-T is a method and toolset** to integrate **textual data** (as a list of documents) and **numeric data** (as Pandas DataFrame) into structured classes that retain **metadata** from various analytical processes, such as **topic modeling** and **decision trees**. Researchers, with or without **GenAI assistance**, can define relationships between textual and numerical datasets based on their chosen **theoretical lens**.  An optional final analytical phase ensures that proposed relationships actually hold true. Further, if the numeric and textual datasets share same id, or if the textual metadata contains keywords that match numeric column names; both datasets are filtered simultaneously, ensuring alignment and facilitating triangulation. üëâ [See Demo](/notes/DEMO.md).

CRISP-T implements **semantic search** using **ChromaDB** to find relevant documents or document chunks based on similarity to a query or reference documents. This is useful for literature reviews to find documents likely to fit inclusion criteria within your corpus/search results. It can also be used for coding/annotating documents by finding relevant chunks within a specific document.

An **MCP server** exposes all functionality as tools, resources, and prompts, enabling integration with AI agent platforms such as Claude desktop, VSCODE and other MCP-compatible clients. CRISP-T cannot directly code the documents, but it provides semantic chunk search that **may be used in association with other tools to acheive automated coding**. For example, VSCODE provides built in tools for editing text and markdown files, which can be used to code documents based on semantic search.

## Installation

```bash
pip install crisp-t
```

Include machine learning features for numeric data analysis (Recommended):
```bash
pip install crisp-t[ml]
```

Include XGBoost for gradient boosting features (Optional):
```bash
pip install crisp-t[xg]
```
* Mac users need to install libomp: `brew install libomp` for XGBoost to work. (Needed only if you want to use XGBoost)

## Command Line Scripts

CRISP-T now provides four main command-line scripts:

- `crisp` ‚Äî Main CLI for qualitative triangulation and analysis (see below)
- `crispviz` ‚Äî Visualization CLI for corpus data (word frequencies, topic charts, wordclouds, etc.)
- `crispt` ‚Äî Corpus manipulation CLI (create, edit, query, and manage corpus objects)
- `crisp-mcp` ‚Äî Starts the MCP server for AI integration (see MCP section below)

All scripts are installed as entry points and can be run directly from the command line after installation.

### crisp (Analytical CLI)

```bash
crisp [OPTIONS]
```

#### Input/Output Options

- `--source, -s PATH|URL`: Read source data from a directory (reads .txt, .pdf and a single .csv) or from a URL
- `--sources PATH|URL`: Provide multiple sources; can be used multiple times
- `--inp, -i PATH`: Load an existing corpus from a folder containing `corpus.json` (and optional `corpus_df.csv`)
- `--out, -o PATH`: When saving the corpus, provide a folder path; the CLI writes `corpus.json` (and `corpus_df.csv` if available) into that folder. When saving analysis results (topics, sentiment, etc.), this acts as a base path: files are written with suffixes, e.g., `results_topics.json`.
- `--unstructured, -t TEXT`: Text CSV column(s) to analyze/compare (can be used multiple times). This is useful when you have free-form text data in a DataFrame. If this is provided, those columns are used as documents.
- `--ignore TEXT`: Comma-separated words to ignore during ingestion (applies to `--source/--sources`)

#### Analysis Options

- `--codedict`: Generate qualitative coding dictionary
- `--topics`: Generate topic model using LDA

	- `--rec THRESHOLD`: Threshold for semantic operations. For `--semantic-chunks`, use 0-10 (default: 8.5). For `--similar-docs`, use 0-1 (default: 0.7). Only results with similarity above this value are returned
	- `--metadata-df`: Export collection metadata as DataFrame+
	- `--metadata-keys KEYS`: Comma-separated metadata keys to include+

	- + *The above two options can be used  to export or add metadata from NLP to the DataFrame. For example, you can extract sentiment scores or topic assignments as additional columns for numerical analysis. This is useful if dataframe and documents are aligned as in a survey response.*

### [Example Usage](/notes/DEMO.md)

When saving the corpus via `--out`, the CLI writes `corpus.json` (and `corpus_df.csv` if present) into the specified folder. If you pass a file path, only its parent directory is used for writing `corpus.json`.

## MCP Server

- `triangulation_guide` - Guide for triangulating qualitative and quantitative findings

### [Example MCP commands](/notes/DEMO.md)

## Role of CRISP-T in research and practice

The workflow enables AI assistants to help conduct comprehensive analyses by combining text analytics, machine learning, and triangulation of qualitative-quantitative findings.

For example, in market research, a company collects:
- **Textual** feedback from customer support interactions.
- **Numerical** data on customer retention and sales performance.
Using this framework, business analysts can investigate how recurring concerns in feedback correspond to measurable business outcomes.
