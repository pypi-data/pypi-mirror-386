# Figlinq Python Library

This package contains utilities for interfacing with Plotly's Chart Studio and Figlinq services. The project has been cloned from [chart-studio 1.1.0](https://pypi.org/project/chart-studio/). The original package has been modified so that credentials and configuration can be set from environment variables (see `figlinq.tools.get_credentials()` and `figlinq.tools.get_config()`). Additional functions have been added to support the Figlinq service. The original package is licensed under the MIT license, and this package is also licensed under the MIT license.

## Installation

```bash
pip install figlinq
```

## Usage

### Basic Grid and Plot Upload

```python
import figlinq
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Create a grid with columns
col1 = figlinq.Column([1, 2, 3], "time")
col2 = figlinq.Column([4, 2, 5], "voltage")
grid = figlinq.Grid([col1, col2])

# Upload the grid
grid_url = figlinq.upload(grid, filetype="grid", filename="time vs voltage")

# Download the grid
downloaded_grid = figlinq.download(grid_url)

# Create a plot that references the grid columns
trace = go.Scatter(xsrc=downloaded_grid[0], ysrc=downloaded_grid[1], mode="lines+markers")
fig = go.Figure(data=[trace])

# Upload the plot
plot_url = figlinq.upload(fig, filetype="plot", filename="My Plot")
```

### Important Notes

- The `figlinq` package registers itself as `chart_studio` in Python's module system for compatibility with Plotly's validators.
- You can use `figlinq.Column` objects directly in Plotly's `xsrc`/`ysrc` parameters when creating plots that reference grid data.
- Both `import figlinq` and `import chart_studio` will work and refer to the same package.
