Commands:

    # Each of these groups is parsed and used on both the server and the client side.
    # The group name (e.g. is_simulator) will be monkey-patched in the Proxy class for the device or service.
    # The other fields are:
    #   description:   Used by the doc_string method to generate a help string
    #   cmd:           Command string that will eventually be sent to the hardware controller for the
    #                  device after the arguments have been filled.
    #   device_method: The name of the method to be called on the device class.
    #                  These should all be defined by the base class for the device, i.e. KeithleyBase.
    #   response:      The name of the method to be called from the device protocol.
    #                  This method should exist in the sub-class of the CommandProtocol base class, i.e.
    #                  in this case it will be the KeithleyProtocol class.

    disconnect:
        description  : Disconnects from the LakeShore336 controller. This command will be sent to the
                       LakeShore336 Control Server which will then disconnect from the hardware controller.
                       This command doesn't affect the ZeroMQ connection of this Proxy to the
                       Control Server. Use the service command `disconnect_cs()` to disconnect
                       from the Control Server.

    connect:
        description:    Connects the LakeShore336 hardware controller

    reconnect:
        description:    Reconnects the LakeShore336 hardware controller.
                        This command will force a disconnect and then try to re-connect to the controller.

    is_simulator:
        description:   Asks if the Control Server is a simulator instead of the real LakeShore336Controller class.

    is_connected:
        description:   Checks if the LakeShore336 hardware controller is connected.

    # Definition of the device commands

    info:
        description:    Identification query
                        Returns basic information about the device (manufacturer, model, serial number, firmware version).

    clear_interface:
        description:    Clear interface command
                        Clears the bits in the status byte register, standard event status register, and operation 
                        event register, and terminates all pending operations.  Clears the interface but not the 
                        controller.  The related controller command is `reset_instrument`.

    reset_instrument:
        description:    Reset instrument command
                        Sets the controller parameters to power-up settings.

    get_selftest_result:
        description:    Selftest query
                        Reports status based on test done at power-up.

    autotune:
        description:    Autotune command
                        Configures autotune parameters.
        cmd:            '{output_channel}, {mode}'

    get_tuning_status:
        description:    Returns Tuning Status

    get_temperature:
        description:    Celsius Temperature Query
        cmd:            '{input_channel}'

    get_heater_output:
        description:    Heater Output Query
        cmd:            '{output_channel}'

    get_pid_parameters:
        description:    Control Loop PID Values Query
        cmd:           '{output_channel}'

    get_temperature_setpoint:
        description:    Control Setpoint Query
        cmd:            '{output_channel}'

    quit:
