Modular polynomials for PARI/GP
===============================

This package contains Atkin type modular polynomials for 500 < p < 800, for use
with ellcard.

These polynomials were extracted from the ECHIDNA databases
available at <http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/>
and computed by David R. Kohel.
