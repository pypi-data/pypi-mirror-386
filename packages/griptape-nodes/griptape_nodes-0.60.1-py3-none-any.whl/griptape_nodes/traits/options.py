    # SERIALIZATION BUG FIX EXPLANATION:
    #
    # PROBLEM: Options trait had a serialization bug where dynamically populated dropdown
    # lists would work correctly during runtime but revert to the first choice after
    # save/reload cycles. This happened because:
    # 1. trait.choices was the "source of truth" during runtime
    # 2. ui_options["simple_dropdown"] was populated from trait.choices
    # 3. Only ui_options gets serialized/deserialized (not trait fields)
    # 4. After reload, trait.choices was stale but ui_options had correct data
    # 5. Converters used stale trait.choices, causing values to revert to first choice
    #
    # SOLUTION: Make ui_options the primary source of truth, with _choices as fallback
    # 1. choices property reads from ui_options["simple_dropdown"] when available
    # 2. choices setter writes to BOTH _choices and ui_options (dual sync)
    # 3. This ensures serialized ui_options data is used after deserialization
    # 4. _choices provides safety fallback if ui_options is missing/corrupted

    _choices: list = field(default_factory=lambda: ["choice 1", "choice 2", "choice 3"])
    element_id: str = field(default_factory=lambda: "Options")
    show_search: bool = field(default=True)
    search_filter: str = field(default="")

    def __init__(self, *, choices: list | None = None, show_search: bool = True, search_filter: str = "") -> None:
