The `LocalFile` source imports files from a local file system.

### Spec

The spec takes the following fields:
*   `path` (`str`): full path of the root directory to import files from
*   `binary` (`bool`, optional): whether reading files as binary (instead of text)
*   `included_patterns` (`list[str]`, optional): a list of glob patterns to include files, e.g. `["*.txt", "docs/**/*.md"]`.
    If not specified, all files will be included.
*   `excluded_patterns` (`list[str]`, optional): a list of glob patterns to exclude files, e.g. `["tmp", "**/node_modules"]`.
    Any file or directory matching these patterns will be excluded even if they match `included_patterns`.
    If not specified, no files will be excluded.

    :::info

    `included_patterns` and `excluded_patterns` are using Unix-style glob syntax. See [globset syntax](https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/index.html#syntax) for the details.

### Schema

The output is a [*KTable*](/docs/core/data_types#ktable) with the following sub fields:
*   `filename` (*Str*, key): the filename of the file, including the path, relative to the root directory, e.g. `"dir1/file1.md"`
*   `content` (*Str* if `binary` is `False`, *Bytes* otherwise): the content of the file
