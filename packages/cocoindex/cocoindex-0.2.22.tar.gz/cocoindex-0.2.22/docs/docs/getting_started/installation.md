## 🐍 Install Python and Pip
To follow the steps in this guide, you'll need:

1. Install [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download/). We support Python 3.11 to 3.13.

## 📦 Install Postgres

You can skip this step if you already have a Postgres database with pgvector extension installed.

If you don't have a Postgres database:

1. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 🐳.
2. Start a Postgres SQL database for cocoindex using our docker compose config:

```bash
docker compose -f <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/refs/heads/main/dev/postgres.yaml) up -d
```

## 🤖 Install Claude Code Skill (Optional)

If you're using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), you can install the CocoIndex skill for enhanced development support. Run these commands in Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add cocoindex-io/cocoindex-claude
/plugin install cocoindex-skills@cocoindex
```

This provides specialized CocoIndex knowledge and workflow support within Claude Code.

## 🎉 All set!

You can now start using CocoIndex.
