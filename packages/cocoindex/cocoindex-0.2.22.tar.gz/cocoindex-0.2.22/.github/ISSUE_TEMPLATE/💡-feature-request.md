Unless the PR can be sent immediately (e.g. just a few lines of code), we recommend you to leave a comment on the issue like **`I'm working on it`**  or **`Can I work on this issue?`** to avoid duplicating work. Our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/zpA9S2DR7s) is always open and friendly.
