Information, Recipient shall, unless prohibited by law, promptly notify Discloser of that fact and cooperate fully
(at Discloser's expense) with Discloser and its legal counsel in opposing, seeking a protective order, seeking to
limit, or appealing the subpoena, legal process, request, order, or requirement to the extent deemed appropriate
by Discloser. Recipient may comply with the subpoena or other legal process or requirement after complying with
the foregoing sentence, but only to the extent necessary for compliance.
3.3.	Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge that the remedies at law available for the protection of
Confidential Information or Intellectual Property may be inadequate, and, without limiting any rights available at

LIMITATION BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, TORT AND STRICT LIABILITY) FOR ANY
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF
DATA, USE, GOODWILL, INCOME, PROFIT OR SAVINGS) OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENT OR ANY PRODUCT, SERVICE OR DELIVERABLE PROVIDED BY FAIR ISAAC
UNDER THE AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE
TYPES OF DAMAGES OR EVEN IF THOSE TYPES OF DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING LIMITATION IS INAPPLICABLE TO: (A) CLIENT'S OBLIGATION TO PAY AMOUNTS OWED
TO FAIR ISAAC FOR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES PROVIDED BY FAIR ISAAC UNDER THE AGREEMENT
OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING COSTS OF COLLECTION OF UNPAID AMOUNTS), (B) DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR AS
A RESULT OF AN INFRINGEMENT OR VIOLATION OF FAIR ISAAC'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (INCLUDING
BREACH OF ANY LICENSE GRANT OR RESTRICTION) AND (C) CLIENT'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE
AGREEMENT.
6.2.	SUBJECT TO SECTION 6.1 AND SECTION 6.3, THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR ALL
CLAIMS ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT, UNDER ANY AND ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, TORT AND
STRICT LIABILITY), WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CLIENT (EXCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION FEES
AND REIMBURSED EXPENSES) FOR THE FAIR ISAAC PRODUCT(S), SERVICE(S) OR DELIVERABLE(S) TO WHICH THE
CLAIM(S) RELATE(S) DURING THE 12 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE MOST RECENT CLAIM
THAT GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY (THE "LIABILITY CAP"). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE FOLLOWING
ARE INDEPENDENT OF AND NOT SUBJECT TO THE LIABILITY CAP: (A) CLIENT'S OBLIGATION TO PAY AMOUNTS
OWED TO FAIR ISAAC FOR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES PROVIDED BY FAIR ISAAC UNDER THE
AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING COSTS OF COLLECTION OF UNPAID AMOUNTS), (B) CLIENT'S
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT, AND (C) DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR AS A RESULT OF
AN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER VIOLATION OF FAIR ISAAC'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (INCLUDING BREACH
OF ANY LICENSE GRANT OR RESTRICTION).
6.3.	NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED TO THE CONTRARY IN THE AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE,
FAIR ISAAC'S LIABILITY CAP FOR ALL COMMUNITY LICENSES, EVALUATION LICENSES AND END USER LICENSES
SHALL BE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500) US DOLLARS. Fair Isaac has set its prices and
entered into the Agreement in reliance upon the limitations of liability and the disclaimers of warranties and
damages set forth herein, and the same forms an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.
7.	Payment Terms
7.1.	Invoices and Payments.
(a) 	All fees and charges (other than expenses) will be set forth in the applicable Purchasing Documentation.
Except as otherwise provided, all fees, charges and expenses must be paid within 30 days of the date of an
invoice. All amounts are payable in the currency stated in the Purchasing Documentation (or, if no currency is
stated in the Purchasing Documentation, then in US Dollars) in accordance with the instructions provided in the
invoice or other instructions provided by Fair Isaac. Without prejudice to its other rights and remedies, if Fair Isaac
does not receive any payment by its due date, Fair Isaac may assess a late payment charge on the unpaid amount
at the rate of 1.5% per month or the highest rate allowed under applicable law, whichever is less. In addition, Fair
Isaac may terminate the relevant Purchasing Documentation, including any licenses granted to Client or otherwise
therein, or terminate the service concerned, but not until Fair Isaac has given Client written notice, and the
amount remains unpaid 30 days after Fair Isaac gives the notice. Client shall reimburse Fair Isaac for all costs
related to any proceedings to collect any amounts owed under or arising out of this Agreement, including without
limitation attorneys' fees and expenses. All fees paid hereunder are nonrefundable without any right of set-off or
deduction.
(b)	Client shall timely pay all fees, costs and expenses hereunder in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement.  Fees for the Fair Isaac Product begin on the Commencement Date. Reference to "year" or "annual"
means each 1-year period that begins on the Commencement Date (or anniversary of the Commencement Date,
as applicable) within the License Term. All annual fees are due and payable on the Commencement Date and
thereafter on every anniversary of the Commencement Date. All one-time set up and other fees are due and
payable on the Effective Date. All monthly fees and all transaction, overage, volume-based and usage fees
(collectively, "Transaction Fees") are due and payable monthly in arrears. If there is a change to a size, tier or
other classification-based fee, such fee is due and payable in arrears immediately following the event that
changed such size, tier or classification.
(c) 	Payment of the fees under the Agreement permit Client to use of the Fair Isaac Product subject to the
Scope/Quantity Limit and other applicable terms, and no additional or excess use is permitted. An amendment to
the Agreement executed by both parties is required before Client is permitted to make any additional or excess
use, and Client understands that fees shall be subject to change.
(d) 	In the event Fair Isaac requests information that is necessary for Fair Isaac to calculate or verify the
Transaction Fees, then Client will send such information within the time specified in Fair Isaac's request. Client is
responsible for payment of all fees for any and all use, access, transmission and/or processing of the Fair Isaac
Product in all environments and phases, as well as additional costs for services or items requested by Client that
are not included in the Fair Isaac Product.
7.2.	Costs and Expenses. Prices do not include reasonable travel and associated out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Fair Isaac in connection with the Agreement, which Client agrees to reimburse at Fair Isaac's actual
cost.
7.3.	Price Adjustments. All fees and charges in the Purchasing Documentation may be reviewed and adjusted
by Fair Isaac on an annual basis. Annual adjustments will not exceed the most recently available annual rate
increase of CPI, provided that the number of users, volume levels, account criteria and other pricing or licensing
metrics have not changed under such Purchasing Documentation (in which case, the increase may be higher than
CPI). "CPI" means (i) with respect to US Dollars, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the
U.S. City Average for All Items, 1982-84=100, as published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and (ii) with
respect to any other currency stated in the Purchasing Documentation, a published consumer price index selected
by Fair Isaac for such currency.
7.4.	Taxes and other Charges. Unless otherwise stated in the Purchasing Documentation, all charges under the
Agreement are stated exclusive of any applicable Taxes, and Client is solely responsible for, and shall pay or
reimburse Fair Isaac for, all Taxes. Fair Isaac shall promptly remit to the appropriate tax authority all Taxes
collected from Client on account of Client's tax obligations, if any. If Fair Isaac receives a refund of Taxes
attributable to amounts paid by Client under the Agreement, Fair Isaac shall pay the refunded amount to Client
within 30 days of its receipt.
7.5.	Verification and Audit Rights. Client shall maintain adequate books, records, and accounting practices and
systems that will allow proper calculation, documentation and reporting of payments due to Fair Isaac under the
Agreement, and that will facilitate auditing of those books, records, systems and Client's use of the Fair Isaac
products, services and deliverables. At Fair Isaac's written request, Client shall promptly provide to Fair Isaac a
written report certified by an authorized officer of Client that provides information reasonably requested by Fair
Isaac to calculate or verify payments due to Fair Isaac under the Agreement, to verify the nature and extent of
Client's use of the Fair Isaac products, services and deliverables, or to verify that Client has complied with the
terms of the Agreement. In addition, upon at least 10 days' prior written notice to Client, Fair Isaac may, at its
expense, audit Client's use of the Fair Isaac products, services and deliverables, and all records of Client relating to
the Agreement. Audits must be conducted at Client's facilities during regular business hours, with as little
disruption to Client's business activities as reasonably possible. Client shall cooperate with Fair Isaac's auditors in
conducting the audit. Fair Isaac may conduct audits no more than twice in any calendar year. Client shall promptly
pay to Fair Isaac the amount of any underpayment discovered in such audit. If Client is discovered to have
understated any fees owed to Fair Isaac by more than 5%, or if Fair Isaac learns that Client has breached the
Agreement, then Client shall also promptly pay to Fair Isaac all reasonable costs of the audit.
8.	Term and Termination
8.1.	Term of SWLA. Unless otherwise terminated as specified in this Article, the term of this SWLA shall
continue for as long as there is a License Term, Evaluation Period, Community License Period and End User License

breach of any provision of the Agreement involving a failure of payment or violation of Fair Isaac's Intellectual
Property Rights (including breach of any license grant or restriction by Client or any user), and fails to remedy the
breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice, then Fair Isaac may at its option terminate (i) the Purchasing
Documentation subject to the breach or (ii) the Agreement.
8.4.	Effect of Termination or Expiration. Upon termination or expiration of any Purchasing Documentation for
any reason: (i) all licenses granted to Client under that Purchasing Documentation and the Agreement will

obligations; (ii) Client shall and shall cause all users to immediately cease using all affected Fair Isaac Products,

documentation, and other Fair Isaac Confidential Information and Intellectual Property; (v) Client shall provide to
Fair Isaac a written certification signed by an authorized officer of Client certifying that Client has complied in full
with the foregoing; and (vi) all fees and other charges provided for in the Agreement or in any Purchasing
Documentation will become immediately due and payable.

Disclaimer), Article 5 (Indemnification), Article 6 (Limitation of Liability), Article 7 (Payment Terms), Section 8.4

deliver it to Fair Isaac and permit its use as contemplated in the Agreement; (ii) has obtained from all individuals,
persons and third parties any required consents and authorizations, and has provided all required notices with

neither it nor anyone acting on its behalf has made or agreed to make any payment, gift, or other consideration,
directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of anyone: (i) who is a director, officer, employee, shareholder, or agent
of Client or (ii) who is in any manner connected with, any government or governmental entity or (iii) who is an
officer, agent, or employee of a political party or (iv) who is a candidate for political office; where such payment,
gift, or other consideration would be illegal under the applicable laws of the United States or any other country.
The foregoing is a continuing representation, and, in addition to any other remedies Fair Isaac has, any failure of
this representation to be true at any time is grounds for immediate termination of the Agreement by Fair Isaac.
(b)	Waiver of Sovereign Immunity. If Client is a sovereign state or a state agency, or otherwise capable of
invoking a defense of sovereign immunity with regard to any dispute under the Agreement, then Client hereby
irrevocably waives any claim to immunity with regard to any proceedings in connection with an arbitration or
arbitral award pursuant to the Agreement, including, without limitation, immunity from service of process,

party suppliers and licensors, and such third parties reserve all rights to their respective Third Party Products,
including all Intellectual Property Rights therein. Unless different flow down terms have been made available to
Client, the license restrictions and other terms of the Agreement protective of the Fair Isaac Product that was

failure to pay fees or comply with any license term, condition or restriction related to the Third Party Product.
Client shall not make or attempt any direct access or independent use of the Third Party Product apart from the
related Fair Isaac Product. Fair Isaac is not responsible for the products, services or content of these Third Party
Products or for the acts or omissions of their suppliers or licensors. Fair Isaac reserves the right to replace any of
these Third Party Products with a comparable alternative.
9.16.	Construction; Severability. The Agreement is not to be more strongly construed against either party,
regardless of who is more responsible for its preparation, and nothing in the Agreement is to be deemed to create
any right or benefit in any person not a party to the Agreement. Client shall cause authorized and permitted
Affiliates to comply with all terms and conditions of the Agreement. If any provision of the Agreement is held to
be unenforceable, unlawful, or invalid in any respect, then that provision will be deemed ineffective only to the
extent of the illegality or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of that provision or any of the remaining
provisions of the Agreement. The Article and Section headings in the Agreement are for reference only, and do
not form part of the Agreement.
9.17.	Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence. The Agreement represents the complete agreement of the
parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes, with respect to such subject matter, all prior or
contemporaneous agreements, proposals, understandings, representations, conditions, and communications (oral
or written), as well as the terms of all existing and future purchase orders and acknowledgments. The terms of a
Policy are subject to change by Fair Isaac in accordance with its terms regarding changes as set forth therein. Any

the case of any conflict between the provisions of this SWLA and a Purchasing Documentation, with respect to the
subject matter of the given Purchasing Documentation, the provisions of the Purchasing Documentation will
control.

binding force or effect. Any notices given pursuant to this Agreement must be in English. In case of a dispute
