Fluidsim is an extensible framework for studying fluid dynamics with numerical
simulations using Python. Fluidsim is an object-oriented library to develop
Fluidsim "solvers" (i.e. Python packages solving equations) by writing mainly
Python code. The result is **very efficient** even compared to a pure Fortran
or C++ code since the time-consuming tasks are performed by optimized compiled
functions.

**Documentation**: <https://fluidsim.readthedocs.io>

## Getting started

To try fluidsim without installation:
[![Binder notebook](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fluiddyn/fluidsim/branch%2Fdefault?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/ipynb)

For a **basic installation** it should be sufficient to run:

    pip install fluidsim

or with [conda/mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge):

    conda install -c conda-forge fluidsim

Much more detailed instructions are given in [the
documentation](https://fluidsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

## How does it work?

Fluidsim is a
[HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) code. It
is part of the wider project
[FluidDyn](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluiddyn/) and its
pseudospectral solvers rely on the library
[fluidfft](http://fluidfft.readthedocs.io) to use very efficient FFT
libraries. Fluidfft is written in C++, Cython and Python. Fluidfft and
fluidsim take advantage of
[Pythran](https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran), an
ahead-of-time compiler which produces very efficient binaries by
compiling Python via C++11.

An advantage of a CFD code written mostly in Python is that, to run
simulations and analyze the results, the users communicate (possibly
interactively) together and with the machine with Python, which is
nowadays among the best languages to do these tasks. Moreover, it is
much simpler and faster than with pure Fortran or C++ codes to add any
complicated analysis or to write a modified solver. Fluidsim can also be
used to extend existing solvers with Python interfaces such as
[Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr).

We have created fluidsim to be **easy and nice to use and to develop**,
**efficient** and **robust**.

*Keywords and ambitions*: fluid dynamics research with Python (>=3.10);
modular, object-oriented, collaborative, tested and documented, free and
open-source software.
