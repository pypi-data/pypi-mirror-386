summary: Checks that tmt clean command chaining works
description: |
    Chaining of subcommands under tmt clean requires special order
    of operations to be forced to remove potential user error,
    such as removing runs and then trying to clean guests (when
    no runs are present and hence no information about guests is
    available). Checks that this order is applied.

    Also verifies that options from the top-level tmt clean command
    are correctly propagated to the chained subcommands.
