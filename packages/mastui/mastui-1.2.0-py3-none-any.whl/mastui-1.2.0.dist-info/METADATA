**Mastui** is a modern Mastodon client for your terminal. Built with Python and the powerful [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) framework, it provides a highly efficient, multi-column layout that lets you keep an eye on all the action at once.

Whether you're a power user who wants to manage multiple accounts or someone who just loves the terminal, Mastui is designed to be your new favorite way to interact with Mastodon.

## üíª Cross-Platform Support

Mastui is built on the cross-platform Textual framework and is tested and expected to work on:

* **Linux**
* **macOS**
* **Microsoft Windows**
* **Android (via Termux)**

If you encounter any platform-specific issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/kimusan/mastui/issues).

## ‚ú® Features

Mastui is packed with features to make your Mastodon experience seamless and efficient:

* **Multi-Column Layout:** View your Home, Local, Notifications, Federated, and Direct Message timelines simultaneously. The layout automatically switches to a single-column view on narrow terminals.
* **Multi-Profile Support:** Securely log into multiple accounts and switch between them instantly with the `u` key. Each profile has its own configuration, cache, and theme settings.
* **Interactive Timelines:**
  * Like (`l`), Boost (`b`), and Reply (`a`) to posts directly.
  * Jump to the top of a timeline with `g`.
  * Scroll infinitely to load older posts from your cache or the server.
  * Scroll position is preserved during automatic refreshes, so you never lose your place.
* **Rich Content Support:**
  * **Image Previews:** View images directly in your terminal with lazy loading for a smooth experience. Multiple renderers are supported (ANSI, Sixel, TGP).
  * **Polls:** View and vote on polls.
  * **Markdown & Links:** Posts are rendered beautifully with clickable links.
* **Full-Featured Composer:**
  * Write new posts (`c`) and replies (`a`) in a full-screen composer.
  * Add Content Warnings (CWs) and select post language.
  * Create and manage polls directly.
* **Deeper Navigation:**
  * View full post threads (`Enter`).
  * View user profiles (`p`), including their bio, stats, and links.
  * Follow, Mute, and Block users directly from their profile.
* **Smart Notifications:**
  * Get detailed pop-up notifications for new Direct Messages (e.g., "New DM from @user").
  * Optionally enable pop-ups for mentions, follows, boosts, and favourites.
* **Highly Configurable:**
  * Toggle the visibility of each timeline.
  * Configure auto-refresh intervals for each timeline.
  * Choose from multiple built-in themes or create your own.
  * **Customize Keybindings:** Change most key bindings to your liking from the options screen.
* **Advanced:**
  * Hidden log viewer (`F12`) for debugging when running with `--debug`.
  * Persistent SQLite cache for fast startup and offline reading.
