# TODO: Development Note 1
#  The property trading_unit and the method tick_size is a little bit troublesome
#  because they reference to another class which somehow serves as a data container
#  (the class Exchange where different exchanges are defined as some kind of data).
#  Problems arise when more exchanges are available (later) and somehow the class
#  Instrument need to know about that to function properly.
#  The exchange property of the Instrument class should only provide logic to
#  access those data not the data directly. The problem still retain with the
#  newly defined Exchange class because it is somehow still a data container.
