        "text": "<c0> Keith Rupert Murdoch was born on 11 March 1931 in Melbourne, Australia, the son of Sir Keith Murdoch (1885-1952) and Dame Elisabeth Murdoch (nee Greene; 1909-2012). <c1> He is of English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. <c2> Murdoch's parents were also born in Melbourne. <c3> Keith Murdoch was a war correspondent and later a regional newspaper magnate owning two newspapers in Adelaide, South Australia, and a radio station in a faraway mining town. <c4> Following his father's death, when he was 21, Murdoch returned from Oxford to take charge of the family business News Limited, which had been established in 1923. <c5> Rupert Murdoch turned its Adelaide newspaper, The News, its main asset, into a major success. <c6> He began to direct his attention to acquisition and expansion, buying the troubled Sunday Times in Perth, Western Australia (1956) and over the next few years acquiring suburban and provincial newspapers in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory, including the Sydney afternoon tabloid, The Daily Mirror (1960). <c7> The Economist describes Murdoch as \"inventing the modern tabloid\", as he developed a pattern for his newspapers, increasing sports and scandal coverage and adopting eye-catching headlines. <c8> Murdoch's first foray outside Australia involved the purchase of a controlling interest in the New Zealand daily The Dominion. <c9> In January 1964, while touring New Zealand with friends in a rented Morris Minor after sailing across the Tasman, Murdoch read of a takeover bid for the Wellington paper by the British-based Canadian newspaper magnate, Lord Thomson of Fleet. <c10> On the spur of the moment, he launched a counter-bid. <c11> A four-way battle for control ensued in which the 32-year-old Murdoch was ultimately successful. <c12> Later in 1964, Murdoch launched The Australian, Australia's first national daily newspaper, which was based first in Canberra and later in Sydney. <c13> In 1972, Murdoch acquired the Sydney morning tabloid The Daily Telegraph from Australian media mogul Sir Frank Packer, who later regretted selling it to him. <c14> In 1984, Murdoch was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for services to publishing. <c15> In 1999, Murdoch significantly expanded his music holdings in Australia by acquiring the controlling share in a leading Australian independent label, Michael Gudinski's Mushroom Records; he merged that with Festival Records, and the result was Festival Mushroom Records (FMR). <c16> Both Festival and FMR were managed by Murdoch's son James Murdoch for several years.",
