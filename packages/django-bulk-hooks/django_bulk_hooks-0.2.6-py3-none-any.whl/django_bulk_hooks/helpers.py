"""
Helper functions for building ChangeSets from operation contexts.

These functions eliminate duplication across queryset.py, bulk_operations.py,
and models.py by providing reusable ChangeSet builders.

NOTE: These helpers are pure changeset builders - they don't fetch data.
Data fetching is the responsibility of ModelAnalyzer.
