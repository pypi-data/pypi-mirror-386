# spicypy

Signal processing & control systems. Combining several tools to facilitate signal processing, control systems modelling,
and the interface between the two.

More details are provided in [Documentation](https://pyda-group.gitlab.io/spicypy/).

# Development roadmap

Spicypy is based on two main packages: [GWpy](https://gwpy.github.io/docs/) for
signal-processing and [python-control](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for control systems modelling. The goal is to reuse as much of existing functionality of
these packages as possible.
Novel functionality to be implemented is discussed in
[Issues](https://gitlab.com/pyda-group/spicypy/-/issues).

Development process is steered by regular [meetings](https://gitlab.com/pyda-group/spicypy/-/wikis/home/meetings)
with participants across the gravitational wave science community.

The project is open for contributions, and feedback on usage is welcome. For reporting bugs and specific code suggestions
please consider [creating an Issue](https://gitlab.com/pyda-group/spicypy/-/issues/new?issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=).
