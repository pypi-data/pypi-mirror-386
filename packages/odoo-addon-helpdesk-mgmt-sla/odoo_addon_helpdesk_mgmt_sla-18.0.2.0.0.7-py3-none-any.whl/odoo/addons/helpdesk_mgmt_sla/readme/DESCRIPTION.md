This module extends the Helpdesk application by introducing Service Level Agreement (SLA) functionality.

- Define and manage multiple SLAs per ticket.
- Track deadlines and compliance for each SLA independently.
- Gain better visibility into support performance and ensure service commitments are met.

With this module, helpdesk teams can enforce response and resolution targets, improving accountability and customer satisfaction.
