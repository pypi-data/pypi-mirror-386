## PTSSL - Wrapper for testssl.sh


## Installation

```
pip install ptssl
```

## Adding to PATH
If you're unable to invoke the script from your terminal, it's likely because it's not included in your PATH. You can resolve this issue by executing the following commands, depending on the shell you're using:

For Bash Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For ZSH Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage examples
```
ptssl -u htttps://www.example.com/
```

## Options
```
-u   --url      <url>      Connect to URL
-ts  --tests    <test>     Specify one or more tests to perform:
                 CT        Testing for supported ciphers
                 PCT       Testing who gives order of ciphers
                 PT        Testing for allowed protocols
                 TSD       Testing server defaults

-t   --threads  <threads>  Set thread count (default 10)
