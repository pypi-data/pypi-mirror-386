    """
    Generate combined table and multiple scatterplots for data analysis assessment.
    
    Creates comprehensive educational visualizations combining data tables with 
    multiple scatterplot options. Perfect for teaching scatter plot interpretation, 
    data analysis skills, and creating multiple-choice assessment questions where 
    students identify which scatterplot correctly represents tabular data.
    
    üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Each scatterplot MUST include ALL 7 required fields: title, x_label, y_label, 
      x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, data_points
    - data_points MUST be dictionaries: [{'x': value, 'y': value}] NOT lists
    - Table rows should be strings for consistent formatting
    
    Educational applications include comparing different scatterplot representations
    of the same dataset, identifying correct vs incorrect data interpretations, 
    teaching statistical literacy, and developing critical analysis skills for
    data visualization assessment and mathematical reasoning.
