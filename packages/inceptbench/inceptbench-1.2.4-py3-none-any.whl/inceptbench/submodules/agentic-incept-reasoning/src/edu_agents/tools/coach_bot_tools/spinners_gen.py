    Generate a probability spinner for teaching chance and probability concepts.
    
    Creates a circular spinner divided into equal sections with category labels.
    Automatically colors sections when color names are used as labels. Useful for
    teaching probability, fractions, and data analysis with engaging themes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    title : str
        Clear title that relates to the spinner's content or purpose
    sections : List[str]

        the spinner: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink, Purple. For non-color labels,
        use words with 7 letters or fewer for optimal display.
