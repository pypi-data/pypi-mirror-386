    Generate stepwise shape pattern diagrams for sequence and pattern recognition.
    
    Creates visual patterns showing step-by-step progression of shapes arranged in 
    rows and columns. Useful for teaching mathematical patterns, sequences, algebraic 
    thinking, and visual pattern recognition. Supports circles, squares, and triangles
    with customizable colors and arrangements.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    steps : List[Dict[str, any]]
        List of step specifications, each containing:
        - rows: Number of rows of shapes (1-10)
        - columns: Number of columns of shapes (1-10)  
        - shape: Shape type - 'circle', 'square', or 'triangle'
        - color: Color of shapes (hex code like '#e78be7' or named color)
        - rotation: Rotation in degrees (only for triangles, optional)
        - label: Optional label for the step (required if more than 3 steps total)
    shape_size : float
        Relative size of the shapes (0.5-2.0, default 1.0)
    spacing : float  
        Horizontal spacing between steps (0.1-1.0, default 0.5)
