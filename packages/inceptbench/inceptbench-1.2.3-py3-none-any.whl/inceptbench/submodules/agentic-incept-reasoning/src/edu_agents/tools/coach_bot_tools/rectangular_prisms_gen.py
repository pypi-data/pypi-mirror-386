    Generate visualization of one or more rectangular prisms with measurements.
    
    Creates 3D visualizations showing rectangular prisms with customizable fill states
    (empty, partial, bottom layer, or full of unit cubes) and dimensional labels.
    Perfect for teaching volume, surface area, and 3D geometry concepts through
    visual representation of spatial relationships and dimensional analysis.
    
    Educational applications include volume calculations, surface area exploration,
    3D geometry understanding, spatial reasoning development, and unit cube
    counting exercises. Supports various fill states to demonstrate different
    levels of completion and measurement visibility for comprehensive
    mathematical instruction.
    
    Note: Layout warnings may occur with multiple prisms but don't affect quality.
