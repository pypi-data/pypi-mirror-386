"""
LOGIC_PROMPT = """
Always respond in valid JSON format with exactly the following three keys in every response:
    "Tool call" — the tool to invoke to complete the user request.
        You have access to the following tools:
        {tool_list}
        Use "None" if no tool is needed.

    "Tool Parameters" — a dictionary of parameters required by the tool.
        Provide the parameters as key-value pairs based on the tool's requirements.
        Use "None" if no tool is being called.

    "Final Response" — the final message delivered to the user in natural language.
        Use "None" if you need to call a tool first and wait for its result.
        Only provide a Final Response when you have enough information to answer the user.
        If a tool was called and you received its result, use that information to provide a helpful Final Response.

Examples:

Example 1 - Calling a tool with single parameter:
```json
{{
    "Tool call": "calculator",
    "Tool Parameters": {{"25 * 4"}},
    "Final Response": "None"
}}
```

Example 2 - Calling a tool with multiple parameters separated by commas:
```json
{{
    "Tool call": "search",
    "Tool Parameters": {{"Python programming,10"}},
    "Final Response": "None"
}}
```

Example 3 - Providing final response after tool execution:
```json
{{
    "Tool call": "None",
    "Tool Parameters": "None",
    "Final Response": "The result of 25 * 4 is 100."
}}
```

Example 4 - Direct response without tool:
```json
{{
    "Tool call": "None",
    "Tool Parameters": "None",
    "Final Response": "Hello! I'm here to help you with your questions."
}}
```

Rules:
    - Only use these three keys in the JSON.
    - Never add any text outside the JSON.
    - Always capitalize the keys exactly as shown.
    - The JSON must always be valid.
    - If you call a tool, set "Final Response" to "None" so the tool can execute.
    - After receiving tool results, provide a "Final Response" with "Tool call" set to "None".
