    """This class defines the capabilities of an LMS connected using LTI 1.3.

    An important note about naming in this class: most of the attribute names
    are not really intuitive. For example: *supporting* `set_deadline` means
    that we probably don't get the deadline from the LMS. This has two main
    reasons: 1) legacy: these strange names mirror the names used in our LTI
    1.1 classes, and 2) it describes what you can do inside CodeGrade with the
    LMS, maybe it is in the future possible to sync back the deadline to the
    LMS, and in this case the name `set_deadline` makes way more sense.
    """

    #: The name of the LMS.

    set_deadline: bool
    #: Same as `set_deadline` but for the `lock_date` date.

    #: Should the state of the assignment be set within CodeGrade and not be
    #: copied from the LMS?  If `False` users are not allowed to change to
    #: state of the assignment within CodeGrade (they can always set the state
    #: to done).

    #: The name of the iframe `postMessage` we can send to the LMS to notify

    #: `Canvas`).

    #: Some LMSes support more replacement variables than others, however we
    #: don't want to send replacement variables to an LMS we know it will never
    #: support. This property contains a list of custom replacement groups
    #: supported by this LMS.  For example: we have a replacement variable

    #: that finding the correct `LTI1p3Provider` is not always correct
    #: (especially as the `iss` often gets used multiple times). For some LMSes
    #: therefore it is a better idea to simply include the id of the provider
    #: in the launch url, and verify with the given information that the
