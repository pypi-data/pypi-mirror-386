CodeGrade is constantly upgrading its API, but we try to minimize backwards
incompatible changes. We'll announce every backwards incompatible change in the
[changelog](http://codegrade.com/changelog). A new version of the API
client is released with every release of CodeGrade, which is approximately every
month. To upgrade simply run `pip install --upgrade codegrade`.
