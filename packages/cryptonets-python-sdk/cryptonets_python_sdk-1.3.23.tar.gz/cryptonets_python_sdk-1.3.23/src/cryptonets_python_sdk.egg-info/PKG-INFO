## Installation

Installation of the CryptoNets Python SDK and its dependencies is provided by `pip`.
If pip is not installed, see the [pip user guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ "pip User Guide") to install
pip.

To ensure smooth installation, it’s recommended to use:

- `pip: 9.0.2` or greater

The safest way to install the SDK is to use pip in a virtualenv:

```
python -m pip install cryptonets_python_sdk
```

If you have the cryptonets_python_sdk package installed and want to upgrade to the latest version, you can run:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade cryptonets_python_sdk
```

This will install the cryptonets_python_sdk package as well as all dependencies.
See the [installation](https://privid-sdk.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cryptonets-python-sdk/last_stable/installation.html) section of
the SDK homepage Guide for more information.

## Usage

You will receive the Server URL and apiKey when you subscribe.

### Import Face factor

`from cryptonets_python_sdk.factor import FaceFactor`

`from cryptonets_python_sdk.settings.loggingLevel import LoggingLevel`

### Initialize and use factor

```
server_url = URL of the server

api_key = APIKEY issued on successful signup

server = FaceFactor(url=server_url, api_key=api_key,
        logging_level=LoggingLevel.full)
```
