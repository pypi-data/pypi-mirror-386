This use case is difficult - and I am no longer recommending that people use it.

P475 was a PBO site. Soil moisture can be extracted, but it is a challenging case. To access 
L2C from the original PBO datasets, 1-Hz data must be downloaded and decimated to 15 seconds. To avoid 
having to do this, we will only use data from the Septentrio receiver (years 2020 thru 2022 ) where the UNAVCO archive 
provides direct access to high-quality SNR data in 15 second files.
