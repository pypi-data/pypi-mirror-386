## What Are Cache Tokens?

**Cache tokens** are Claude's efficiency mechanism for reusing processed information across conversations and requests. Think of them as "smart notes" that Claude takes and references to avoid reprocessing the same content repeatedly.

### The Library Analogy

Imagine a library system:

- **Normal tokens:** Reading a book from scratch every time you need information
- **Cache creation tokens:** The librarian cataloging and organizing books (expensive upfront work)
- **Cache read tokens:** Quickly finding a book that's already been cataloged (very fast and cheap)

---

## Cache Token Types

### 1. **Cache Read Tokens** (`cache_read_tokens`)

**Purpose:** Reuse previously processed information
**Cost:** **10% of normal input price** (extremely cheap!)
**When it happens:** Claude references cached context from earlier in conversation

**Example:**
```json
"cache_read_input_tokens": 31696
```

**Real meaning:** Claude is quickly accessing 31,696 tokens worth of previously processed information instead of reprocessing it from scratch.

### 2. **Cache Creation Tokens** (`cache_creation_tokens`)

**Purpose:** Store information for future efficient access
**Cost:** **125-200% of normal input price** (expensive investment)
**When it happens:** Claude anticipates future questions and proactively caches relevant information

**Cache Duration Types:**
- **5-minute cache:** 125% of input price (25% premium)
- **1-hour cache:** 200% of input price (100% premium)

**Example:**
```json
"cache_creation_input_tokens": 350,
"cache_creation": {
    "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 350,
    "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0
}
```

## How Cache Tokens Differ from Normal Tokens

| Token Type | Cost Multiplier | Purpose | When Used |
|------------|----------------|---------|-----------|
| **Input Tokens** | 1.0x (baseline) | Process new user content | Every request |
| **Output Tokens** | 5.0x (expensive) | Generate Claude's response | Every response |
| **Cache Read** | 0.1x (very cheap) | Access cached information | Subsequent requests |
| **Cache Creation** | 1.25x - 2.0x | Store for future efficiency | Anticipatory caching |

### Key Differences

1. **Normal tokens** process information in real-time
2. **Cache read tokens** instantly access pre-processed information
3. **Cache creation tokens** invest in future efficiency

## Real-World Example: Zen Cache Behavior

From actual `zen_run.log` analysis, here's what happens during a typical session:

### Initial Request (Apparent vs Reality)
```
User: "which are the files that need to added to the  version of zen"
```

**Token Usage:**
```json
{
    "input_tokens": 7,                    // Tiny user request
    "cache_creation_input_tokens": 350,   // Claude creates cache
    "cache_read_input_tokens": 31696,     // Claude reads existing cache
    "output_tokens": 25                   // Claude's response
}
```

### 🤔 Wait - How Can the "First" Request Read 31,696 Cache Tokens?

**Key Insight:** This isn't actually the first request! Here's the hidden timeline:

#### The Real Sequence (from zen_run.log):

**1. Session Initialization (Hidden)**
```
session_id: "a1552dba-ca55-4c40-9f74-7d2ecacd1ae3"
```
Claude Code establishes session context

**2. Workspace Scanning (Hidden)**
```json
// Lines 112-126 in log show tool executions:
"toolu_01VnGdoe9e4RhYHJBgZZhAaL": Directory listing
"toolu_01UhPFfYX2k9wDZcwZDLCCjf": Project scanning
"toolu_016xMbvpqQ8MaRTtydfEZT7v": File enumeration
```

**3. Automatic Context Loading (Hidden)**
- README.md processed and cached
- Configuration files analyzed
- Project structure mapped
- Dependencies scanned

**4. User Question (Visible)**
Now when user asks about  files, Claude reads from the cache created during steps 1-3!

### Cache Timeline Breakdown

| Phase | Activity | Cache Created | Cache Read | Visible to User |
|-------|----------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Initialization** | Workspace scan | ~15,000 tokens | 0 tokens | ❌ Hidden |
| **Tool Execution** | Directory listing | ~10,000 tokens | ~5,000 tokens | ❌ Hidden |
| **Context Loading** | README/config analysis | ~8,000 tokens | ~12,000 tokens | ❌ Hidden |
| **User Request** | " files question" | 350 tokens | 31,696 tokens | ✅ Visible |

### What's happening:
1. **Before user asks anything:** Claude Code automatically scans workspace, creating substantial cache
2. **User asks simple 7-token question:** Claude leverages all previously cached context
3. **Claude reads 31,696 tokens:** This is from the hidden initialization work
4. **Claude creates 350 new tokens:** Anticipating more -related questions
5. **Claude responds with 25 output tokens:** Efficient answer using cached context

### Follow-up Request
```json
{
    "input_tokens": 6,                    // Even smaller request!
    "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2661,  // More cache created
    "cache_read_input_tokens": 43187,     // Reading even more cache
    "output_tokens": 18                   // Small response
}
```

### Final Session Statistics
```
Total Tokens: 474,703
├── Input: 75 (0.02%)
├── Output: 1,740 (0.37%)
├── Cache Creation: 47,114 (9.9%)
└── Cache Read: 425,774 (89.7%)

Cache Hit Rate: 99.6%
```

## Cost Analysis

### Pricing Breakdown (Claude Sonnet)

**Base Rates:**
- Input tokens: $3.00 per million
- Output tokens: $15.00 per million
- Cache read: $0.30 per million (10% of input)
- Cache creation (5min): $3.75 per million (125% of input)

### Real Example Costs

From the zen session analysis:

**With Caching:**
- Cache Creation (47.1K tokens): 47,114 × $3.75/M = $0.177
- Cache Read (425.8K tokens): 425,774 × $0.30/M = $0.128
- Input/Output: 1,815 × $9.00/M = $0.016
- **Total: $0.321**

**Without Caching (hypothetical):**
- All tokens at full price: 474,703 × $3.00/M = $1.424
- **Savings: $1.103 (77% cost reduction!)**

**Important Context Length Consideration:**
Per normal LLM science, cache benefits are partially offset by the computational costs of processing longer contexts. While cache read tokens are 90% cheaper per token, the model still needs to process the entire context window, which increases latency and computational overhead. The net benefit remains positive but is moderated by these factors.

## Cache Creation Without Reading Many Tokens

### The Counter-Intuitive Behavior

**Common misconception:** "You need to read a lot to cache a lot"
**Reality:** Claude creates cache through **hidden initialization** and **anticipatory patterns**

### How It Really Works

#### 1. **Hidden Initialization Phase**
Before your first visible request, Claude Code automatically:
- Scans workspace directory structure
- Processes configuration files (config_example.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Analyzes README and documentation
- Maps project dependencies

**Evidence from zen_run.log:**
```
Lines 112-126: Multiple tool executions before user request
- Directory scanning tools
- File enumeration processes
- Configuration analysis
```

#### 2. **Anticipatory Caching**
Based on small inputs, Claude predicts what you'll ask about:

**Example from Log:**
- **User Input:** 7 tokens asking about  files
- **Cache Creation:** 350 tokens
- **Claude's Logic:** "User is working on  release, they'll probably ask about:"
  - Package structure and dependencies
  - File inclusion/exclusion patterns
  - Configuration differences
  - Documentation requirements

#### 3. **Context Accumulation**
Each request builds on previous context:

| Request # | Input Tokens | Cache Created | Cache Read | Total Context |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Hidden Init | 0 | 15,000 | 0 | 15,000 |
| Tool Scans | 25 | 8,000 | 5,000 | 28,000 |
| User Q1 | 7 | 350 | 31,696 | 60,000+ |
| User Q2 | 6 | 2,661 | 43,187 | 106,000+ |

### Why This Happens

**Claude Code Strategy:**
1. **Proactive workspace understanding** - Better to cache once than reprocess repeatedly
2. **Session efficiency** - Assume users will have multiple related questions
3. **Context building** - Each interaction deepens understanding for better responses

**Result:** What appears as "cache creation without reading much" is actually cache creation based on extensive hidden preparation work.

---

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Leverage Long Conversations**

```bash
# Good: Multiple related questions in one session
zen "analyze the zen codebase structure"
zen "what files are needed for  release?"
zen "how should we package this for PyPI?"
```

**Why it works:** Cache read tokens become increasingly valuable as conversation continues.

### 2. **Use Workspace-Specific Sessions**

```bash
# Start in your project directory
cd ~/my-project
zen "analyze this codebase"
# Future questions will leverage cached project context
```

### 3. **Ask Follow-up Questions**

Instead of separate sessions, ask related questions in sequence:

```bash
# Efficient: Related questions in one session
zen "explain the authentication system" \
    "how can we improve security?" \
    "what tests should we add?"
```

### 4. **Monitor Cache Hit Rates**

Zen displays cache statistics:
```
Tokens: 474.7K total, 472.9K cached | Cache hit rate: 99.6%
```

**Target:** >90% cache hit rate for cost efficiency

---

## Troubleshooting

### Low Cache Hit Rate

**Symptoms:**
```
Cache hit rate: <50%
High input token usage
```

**Solutions:**
- Use longer conversations instead of separate sessions
- Ask related questions in sequence
- Work within the same workspace/project
- Allow Claude Code's initialization phase to complete before judging efficiency

### High Cache Creation Costs

**Symptoms:**
```
Cache Creation tokens > Input tokens
```

**Diagnosis:** Normal behavior for workspace exploration
**Optimization:** Continue conversation to get ROI from cache investment

### Unexpected Token Usage

**Check the logs:**
```bash
# Look for cache token breakdown in zen output
zen --verbose
```

**Key metrics to monitor:**
- `cache_read_input_tokens`: Should be high for efficiency
- `cache_creation_input_tokens`: Investment for future savings
- Cache hit rate percentage

## Advanced Topics

### Cache Duration Strategy

**5-minute cache (default):**
- Good for: Active development sessions
- Cost: 25% premium
- Use case: Iterative coding, debugging

**1-hour cache:**
- Good for: Long analysis sessions
- Cost: 100% premium
- Use case: Code reviews, documentation

### Integration with Zen

Zen automatically tracks and optimizes cache usage:

```json
{
    "cache_transparency": {
        "cache_read_cost_usd": 0.128,
        "cache_creation_cost_usd": 0.177,
        "total_cost_savings": 1.103,
        "efficiency_percentage": 77
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cache read tokens are your friend** - 90% cheaper than normal processing
2. **Cache creation is an investment** - pays off in longer conversations, though offset by longer context usage per standard LLM science
3. **Hidden initialization creates most cache** - Claude Code scans workspace before your first question
4. **Context continuity matters** - keep related work in the same session
5. **"First" requests aren't really first** - they leverage hidden preparation work
6. **Monitor your cache hit rate** - aim for >90% efficiency, considering cache benefits are offset by increased context processing costs
7. **Don't fear cache creation costs** - they enable future savings, balanced against longer context processing overhead
8. **Workspace scanning is invisible but valuable** - creates foundation for efficient interactions
9. **Cache efficiency is offset by context length** - per normal LLM science, cached contexts still incur processing costs proportional to their length
