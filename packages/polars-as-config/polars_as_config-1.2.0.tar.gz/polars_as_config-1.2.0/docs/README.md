## How this repository is documented

This project is documented in the Wiki of this repository.
To populate the Wiki with well-written, exhaustive content, I will try to instead of writing it myself, provide an LLM with enough context do to a good-enough job of explaining everything.

With this goal in mind, the context-dump directory will contain a context-dump of the goals, strategies, vision, implementation, usage etc of this repository. We can then use this context dump to generate relevant documentation.
Additionally, this can then also be used to query the "core" documentation further, without me having to structure it, and without an AI reading AI written docs.

I'm always open to tips on how I could improve this, or feedback on the performance of this method.
