"""Data models for HTTP request analysis.

This module contains immutable data structures used throughout the httptap
application to store and transfer metrics, timing information, and request/
response data.

All models use dataclasses with slots for memory efficiency and clear
structure. Models are designed to be serializable to JSON for export
and API integration.

Key Models:
    - TimingMetrics: Phase-by-phase request timing breakdown.
    - NetworkInfo: IP address, TLS version, cipher, certificate details.
    - ResponseInfo: HTTP status, headers, body size.
    - StepMetrics: Complete metrics for one request in a redirect chain.

The models follow immutability principles where possible, with explicit
mutation methods (like calculate_derived) clearly documented.

Examples:
    Creating and using metrics:
        >>> timing = TimingMetrics(dns_ms=12.5, connect_ms=45.0)
        >>> timing.calculate_derived()
        >>> print(timing.to_dict())
        {'dns_ms': 12.5, 'connect_ms': 45.0, ...}

                the first byte of the response. Calculated as:

            Both values are clamped to 0 to handle edge cases where timing
            measurements may have slight inconsistencies due to measurement
            precision or system clock adjustments.
