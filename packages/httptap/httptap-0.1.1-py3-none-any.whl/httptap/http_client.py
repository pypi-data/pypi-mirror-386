"""HTTP client with detailed timing instrumentation.

This module provides an HTTP client that captures precise timing information
for each phase of the request: DNS resolution, TCP connection, TLS handshake,
time to first byte, and body transfer.

The timing collection uses httpx's event hooks and low-level trace callbacks
to capture accurate measurements at each phase boundary. When precise timing
is unavailable (e.g., connection pooling or HTTP/2 multiplexing), the module
falls back to estimated timing based on heuristics.

Key Features:
    - Phase-by-phase timing: DNS, TCP, TLS, TTFB, transfer phases.
    - HTTP/2 support with accurate timing.
    - TLS certificate inspection.
    - Graceful fallback for missing timing data.
    - User-Agent identification for debugging.

Implementation Notes:
    The module uses a two-stage approach for timing:
    1. Primary: httpx EventHooks for precise low-level events
    2. Fallback: Estimation using fixed ratios when hooks unavailable

    For HTTPS, when precise connect/TLS timing is unavailable, we estimate
    from the time between DNS completion and TTFB (the connection phase):
    - TCP Connect: 30% of connection_phase_time
    - TLS Handshake: 70% of connection_phase_time

    Where connection_phase_time = TTFB_total - DNS_time

    These ratios (30%/70%) are conservative estimates based on typical
    network conditions where TLS handshake dominates connection time.

Examples:
    Basic usage:
        >>> timing, network, response = make_request(
        ...     "https://example.com",
        ...     timeout=10.0,
        ...     http2=True,
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Total: {timing.total_ms:.1f}ms")
        Total: 234.5ms

    Performs a complete HTTP GET request with detailed instrumentation to

    This is the main entry point for making instrumented HTTP requests.
    It handles:
    - Manual DNS resolution with timing
    - HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support
    - Precise timing collection via httpx traces
    - TLS certificate inspection (separate probe)
    - Response header and body parsing

    Args:
        url: Target URL to request. Must be valid HTTP/HTTPS URL with scheme.
        timeout: Maximum time to wait for complete response in seconds.
            Applies to the entire request including DNS, connection, and transfer.
        http2: Whether to enable HTTP/2 protocol negotiation. Set to False
            to force HTTP/1.1.
        dns_resolver: Custom DNS resolver implementation.
            Defaults to SystemDNSResolver.
        tls_inspector: Custom TLS inspector implementation.
            Defaults to SocketTLSInspector.
        timing_collector: Custom timing collector implementation.
            Defaults to PerfCounterTimingCollector.
        force_new_connection: Force httpx to create a new connection instead
            of reusing pooled connections. When True (default), ensures accurate
            connect/TLS timing by disabling connection pooling. Set to False
            for better performance when timing accuracy is not critical.
        headers: Optional HTTP headers applied to the request. User-supplied
            values override the defaults (except the tool's User-Agent).

    Returns:
        Tuple of (timing_metrics, network_info, response_info):
            - timing_metrics: Phase-by-phase timing breakdown.
            - network_info: IP, TLS version, cipher, certificate details.
            - response_info: Status, headers, body size, parsed date.

    Raises:
        HTTPClientError: If request fails at any phase (DNS, connect,
            TLS handshake, timeout, or HTTP error). The exception message
            contains details about the failure.

    Examples:
        Basic request:
            >>> timing, network, response = make_request("https://example.com")
            >>> print(f"Status: {response.status}")
            Status: 200
            >>> print(f"IP: {network.ip}")
            IP: 93.184.216.34
            >>> print(f"Total time: {timing.total_ms:.1f}ms")
            Total time: 234.5ms

        With custom implementations:
            >>> custom_resolver = MyDNSResolver()
            >>> timing, network, response = make_request(
            ...     "https://api.example.com",
            ...     dns_resolver=custom_resolver,
            ...     timeout=5.0,
            ...     http2=False
            ... )

    Notes:
        The function performs DNS resolution manually before the HTTP request
        to capture accurate DNS timing. The resolved IP is not passed to httpx,
        so httpx will perform its own DNS resolution internally.

        For HTTPS requests, the function makes a separate TLS probe connection
        to extract detailed certificate information (CN, expiry, etc). This probe
        happens after the main request completes and adds minimal overhead.

        By default (force_new_connection=True), connection pooling is disabled
        to ensure accurate connect/TLS timing from httpcore trace events.
        Set force_new_connection=False for better performance when precise
        timing is not critical.
