"""The twirling strategies supported by the boxing pass manager.

The boxing pass manager begins by constructing twirling boxes that contain one layer of multi-qubit
gates or measurements, preceeded by all of the adjacent single-qubit gates. Next, it proceeds by
adding idling qubits to the boxes based on the selected twirling strategy. The following options are
supported:

 * ``'active'``: No idling qubit is added to the boxes, meaning that every box only twirls the
    qubits that are active within the box.
 * ``'active_accum'``: Idling qubits are added so that each individual box twirls the union of the
    instructions qubits in the circuit up to the current twirled box.
 * ``'active_circuit'``: Idling qubits are added so that each individual box twirls all of the
    instructions qubits in the circuit.
 * ``'all'``: Idling qubits are added so that each individual box twirls all of the qubits in
    the circuit.
