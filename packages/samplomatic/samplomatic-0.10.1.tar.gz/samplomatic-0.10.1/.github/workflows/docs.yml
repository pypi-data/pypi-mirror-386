name: Build Docs
# This workflow builds the docs on all branches and releases,
# but it only deploys for the main branch and releases. Specifically
#  - Deploy to gh-pages:dev/ for builds of main
#  - Deploy to gh-pages:/ for builds of release
#  - Also deploy to gh-pages:/stable/<version> for builds of release
# This third step is done to make the version drop-down menu work
