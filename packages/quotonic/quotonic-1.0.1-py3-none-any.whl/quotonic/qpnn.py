"""
The `quotonic.qpnn` module includes classes that contain different models of quantum photonic neural networks (QPNNs),
each designed to explore different capabilities in detail. `QPNN` serves as a template for these models and thus
includes attributes that are relevant to all. The other classes inherit `QPNN` and build from it, yet remain
organized similarly to each other in many ways, as will be discussed further below.

QPNNs are brain-inspired, nonlinear photonic circuits that have been predicted to near-deterministically (i.e. with
near 100% success rates) generate, and process, quantum entanglement. Driven with light, these networks leverage the
multiplexing, low latency, and ultra-low operational powers of mature photonic integrated circuits similarly to their
classical counterparts. By adding optical nonlinearities to the processing toolkit, QPNNs feature components that not
only induce the necessary photon-photon interactions for efficient processing, but also act analogous to the
activation (i.e. learning) function of conventional neural networks, allowing QPNNs to be trained to perform
specified input-output mappings between quantum photonic states. Building on this operating principle, QPNNs have
been considered for conducting quantum simulation, accelerating quantum state tomography, and even speeding up more
common machine learning tasks like image recognition or natural language processing.

As displayed in the exemplary four-mode, two-layer network shown below, each QPNN is constructed from $m$ optical
modes and $L$ layers, where each layer is realized by a linear, rectangular $m\\times m$ Mach-Zehnder inteferometer
(MZI) mesh. By selecting the two controllable phase shifters $(\\phi, \\theta)$ in each MZI, each layer can be
programmed to perform any arbitrary linear unitary transformation $\\mathbf{U}$ on the optical modes of the photons
(see [clements](clements.md) for more details). Single-site few-photon optical nonlinearities $\\Sigma(\\varphi)$,
of effective nonlinear phase shift $\\varphi$ (ideally $\\pi$, see [nl](nl.md) for more details), are placed between
consecutive layers. These elements are key to network operation as they provide the learning capabilities to the
neural network and allow it to realize near-deterministic entangling operations.

<img width="800" src="../img/dark/qpnn.png" class="only-dark">
</p>

By simply piecing all the sections of the network together, a QPNN can be described by the transfer function,

$$ \\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{U}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_L, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_L) \\cdot \\prod_{i = 1}^{L - 1} \\boldsymbol{
\\Sigma}(\\varphi) \\cdot \\mathbf{U}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i), $$

where each $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_L, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_L$ are vectors that contain all the $\\phi, \\theta$ phase
shifts in each MZI for the $i^\\text{th}$ layer. This transfer function will act on the $k^\\text{th}$ input state
$\\left|\\mathrm{in}\\right\\rangle_k$ to produce an output state $\\left|\\mathrm{out}\\right\\rangle_k = \\mathbf{
S}\\left|\\mathrm{in}\\right\\rangle_k$. Comparing the output with the target state $\\left|\\mathrm{
targ}\\right\\rangle_k$, (i.e. according to a truth table), the unconditional fidelity (or equivalently the success
rate) for the $k^\\text{th}$ input-target pair is given by

$$ \\mathcal{F}_k^{(\\mathrm{unc})} = \\left|{}_k\\!\\left\\langle\\mathrm{targ}\\right|\\mathbf{S}\\left|\\mathrm{
in}\\right\\rangle\\!{}_k\\right|^2, $$

which describes the chance that the network produces the targeted output state for any given input state without
conditions. To train the QPNN, an optimization algorithm maximizes the unconditional fidelity (or equivalently
minimizes the cost/network error $\\mathcal{C}^{(\\mathrm{unc})} = 1 - \\mathcal{F}^{(\\mathrm{unc})}$) using the
variational phase shift parameters from its $L$ layers (see [trainer](trainer.md) for more details on training).

Alternatively, the success of a QPNN operation may be conditioned on the detection of a logical output, that is,
one where the photons are detected in a combination of output modes that corresponds to the qubit encoding scheme. In
the image above, dual-rail encoding for the photonic qubits is considered such that a logical output is one where a
single photon is detected in one of the upper two modes while the other is detected in one of the bottom two modes.
This measure is termed the conditional fidelity  (or equivalently just fidelity) $\\mathcal{F}_k^{(\\mathrm{con})}$,
each $k^\\text{th}$ term of which can be multiplied by the corresponding probability that the network produces a
logical output in the computational basis $\\mathcal{P}_k^{(\\mathrm{cb})}$ (or equivalently logical rate),

$$ \\mathcal{F}_k^{(\\mathrm{unc})} = \\mathcal{F}_k^{(\\mathrm{con})}\\mathcal{P}_k^{(\\mathrm{cb})}, $$

to retrieve the $k^\\text{th}$ term of the unconditional fidelity.

With this background in mind, the structure of the classes for each QPNN model can be described more clearly. Upon
instantiation, each model prepares all pieces of the network architecture, from the linear layers to the nonlinear
sections, though the specific way that these components are prepared may differ slightly between models. Each class
has a property called `training_set` that can be used to set and retrieve a training set for an instantiated QPNN.
They also include a method called `build` to construct the system function $\\mathbf{S}$ in full. With the system
function and a training set, the aforementioned performance measures can be calculated, and these calculations tend
to make up the remainder of the class methods. All of these properties and methods differ slightly between models
which is why they are not written into the base class `QPNN` itself. If you decide to use `quotonic` to perform
research on QPNNs, feel free to develop your own model and a corresponding class to go with it. That is essentially
the best way to use this part of the package from a research standpoint. Also, we'd be happy to add it if it fits the
format appropriately, so please reach out!

    that power a tree-type photonic cluster state generation protocol.

    Here, we extend upon the QPNN model further, now incorporating both imperfections as well as the cavity-assisted
    three-level system scattering nonlinearity introduced in [J. R. Basani *et al*., "Universal logical quantum
    photonic neural network processor via cavity-assisted interactions", *npj Quantum Inf* **11**, 142 (2025)](
    https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-025-01096-9). Additionally, this model is specifically designed for compatibility
    with the tree-type photonic cluster state generation protocol outlined in [J. Ewaniuk *et al*., "Large-Scale
    Tree-Type Photonic Cluster State Generation with Recurrent Quantum Photonic Neural Networks", arXiv:2505.14628
    [quant-ph]](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.14628). As in `IdealQPNN`, a provided truth table defines the
    training set, however, this set is more involved than the previous models. When generating trees, the QPNN must
    perform photon-number-dependent operations, responding only to the input photons without active adjustment. As a
    result, there are multiple training subsets for different numbers of photons, and more specifically different
    tree unit cells that must be formed.
