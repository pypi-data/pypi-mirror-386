The `quotonic.aa` module includes functions and classes required to perform transformations from a single-photon
unitary matrix ($m\\times m$ where $m$ is the number of optical modes) to a multi-photon unitary matrix ($N\\times
N$ where $N$ is the dimension of the Fock basis for $n$ photons and $m$ modes). This transformation is required to
describe how unitaries encoded in the Clements configuration act on states resolved in a general basis of multiple
photons since $N \\neq m : n > 1$.

The code in this module has been inspired by the description of multi-photon unitary transformations in [S.

        quantization Fock basis.

        This method constructs the corresponding multi-photon unitary, $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{U})$, from input
        single-photon unitary $\\mathbf{U}$. Vectorially, each element of the multi-photon unitary $\\boldsymbol{
        \\Phi}(\\mathbf{U})$ is computed using the transformation of Aaronson & Arkhipov. Each  element can be
        denoted as $\\left\\langle S \\right|\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{U})\\left| T \\right\\rangle$ where
        $\\left|S\\right\\rangle = \\left|s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_m\\right\\rangle$, $\\left|T\\right\\rangle = \\left|t_1,
        t_2,\\dots,t_m\\right\\rangle$ represent arbitrary Fock basis states and $m$ denotes the number of optical
        modes. For a given element, an $m\\times n$ matrix, $\\mathbf{U}_T$, is constructed by taking $t_j$ copies of
        column $j$ in the input single-photon unitary $\\mathbf{U}$ for all $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,m\\}$. Next,
        an $n\\times n$ matrix, $\\mathbf{U}_{S,T}$, is constructed by taking $s_j$ copies of row $j$ in the
        previously generated matrix, $\\mathbf{U}_T$, for all $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,m\\}$. The matrix element of
        multi-photon unitary, $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{U})$ is then given by,

        $$ \\left\\langle S\\right|\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{U})\\left| T\\right\\rangle =
        \\left\\langle s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_m\\right| \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{U})\\left|t_1,t_2,\\dots,
        t_m\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\text{Per}(\\mathbf{U}_{S,T})}{\\sqrt{s_1!\\dots s_m!t_1!\\dots t_m!}}. $$

        As an example, consider a case where there are 2 photons ($n = 2$) and 3 modes ($m = 3$). The input
        Clements-encoded single-photon unitary is given by,

        $$ \\mathbf{U} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_{00} & u_{01} & u_{02} \\\\ u_{10} & u_{11} & u_{12} \\\\ u_{20} & u_{21}
        & u_{22} \\end{pmatrix}. $$

        To compute the matrix element $\\left\\langle 101\\right|\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{U})\\left|011\\right
        \\rangle$, first build $\\mathbf{U}_T$ by taking 0 copies of the first column of $\\mathbf{U}$, 1 copy of the
        second, and 1 copy of the third,

        $$ \\mathbf{U}_T = \\begin{pmatrix} u_{01} & u_{02} \\\\ u_{11} & u_{12} \\\\ u_{21} & u_{22} \\end{pmatrix}. $$

        Next, build $\\mathbf{U}_{S,T}$ by taking 1 copy of the first row of $\\mathbf{U}_T$, 0 copies of the second,
        and 1 copy of the third,

        $$ \\mathbf{U}_{S,T} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_{01} & u_{02} \\\\ u_{21} & u_{22} \\end{pmatrix}. $$

        The permanent of $\\mathbf{U}_{S,T}$ must be calculated to compute the corresponding matrix element of
        $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{U})$. This is managed by the [perm](perm.md) module.
