UADAPy is a Python library to support an easy analysis of uncertain data.

The library provides:
- uncertainty-aware algorithms for different visualization algorithms, including UAMDS
- easy-to-use visualizations for uncertain data

## Installation
So far the library is very much work in progress, but you can already use it via pip:
```
pip install uadapy
```

## Documentation
You can find the documentation here: https://unistuttgart-visus.github.io/uadapy/
