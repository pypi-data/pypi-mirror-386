# StrongMind Deployment

## What?
Deployment scripts for StrongMind, using Pulumi.

## Development
Write pytest tests for functionality you need. When you need to use this with real AWS resources in a development environment, you'll need to follow these steps.

* Log your shell into the AWS account you're test deploying to (If you don't already have access keys set up, you can find how to do this in the [Amazon SSO portal](https://strongmind.awsapps.com/start#/), under "Programmatic Access")
* Find the relevant container image you're deploying [from ECR](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories?region=us-west-2). (Choose the relevant project container, then the image tag, and then copy the URI field).
* Find the Rails Master Key for that project. Usually this is kept in the [github actions secrets](https://github.com/StrongMind/frozen-desserts/settings/secrets/actions) for that project.
* Get the cloudflare API token and pulumi state passwords from bitwarden if you have access, or get this from devops otherwise.
* Use these to construct an environment in your preferred fashion with the following keys
  * CONTAINER_IMAGE
  * RAILS_MASTER_KEY
  * CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
  * PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE
* In the project that you are testing with, in the infrastructure directory, there will be a requirements.txt file. In order to use your development code, rather than the published version of this library, you will need to change the line that says "strongmind_deployment" to `-e /path/to/this/directory`, using the directory that this README is located in.
* Reinstall the requirements in your pulumi infrastructure directory. Usually this looks like 
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now use pulumi commands like `pulumi preview` and `pulumi up` to make changes.

We usually use the [frozen-desserts](https://github.com/StrongMind/frozen-desserts) application to do simple tests of a non-production application.
