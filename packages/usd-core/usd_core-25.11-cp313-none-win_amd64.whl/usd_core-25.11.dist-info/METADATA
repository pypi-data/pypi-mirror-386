Universal Scene Description (USD) is a system that scalably encodes and
interchanges static and time-sampled 3D geometry, shading and lighting data
between Digital Content Creation applications. Domain-specific schema modules
define the geometry, shading, and lighting encoding atop USD's domain-agnostic
core. It provides a low-level data model that supports plugin implementations,
and a scenegraph built on top of a multi-threaded "composition engine" for
creating complex scenes out of reusable, modular assets.

This package provides the core USD libraries. It does not provide any of
the optional plugins or imaging features from the full USD distribution.
