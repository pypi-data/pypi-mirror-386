# QUEST: A machine learning framework to generate quasar spectra

QUEST (Quasar Unsupervised Encoder and Synthesis Tool) is an implementation of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) with the primary purpose of generating realistic quasar spectra and post-processing them to obtain synthetic quasar photometry. QUEST can also be used to reconstruct spectra with limited wavelength coverage, absorption systems, and even the continuum blueward of the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line (with some caveats).

Check out the [paper]() for a full breakdown of its capabilities and limitations.

## Install instructions

We recommend installing QUEST in a dedicated virtual environment.

1.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (e.g., using `venv`):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv_name
    source venv_name/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    ```

2.  **Install from source:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/cosmic-dawn-group/QUEST.git](https://github.com/cosmic-dawn-group/QUEST.git)
    cd QUEST
    pip install -e .
    ```

3.  or **Install from PyPI:**
    ```bash
    pip install quest_qso
    ```
    *Note: Updates on the PyPI version might lag slightly behind the main repository.*

    **A note of caution:** QUEST has been tested as much as possible, but there are surely bugs and aspects to improve. Please report any issue you find using the **GitHub Issues** tab, or consider sending us an email ([francesco.guarneri@uni-hamburg.de](mailto:francesco.guarneri@uni-hamburg.de)).

## Environment variables

QUEST uses a few environment variables to set its output folders and ensure that it does not overuse resources on shared machines.

* `QUEST_LOCALPATH` â€” General cache directory. This is the primary folder used to download all cached files and save generated spectra/photometry in the examples. If downloaded using the utilities included in QUEST, this will also contain the datasets used to train the model.
* `QUEST_LOG_TO_FILE` - QUEST logs to the terminal by default. However, if this variable is set to `True` or `1`, an additional log file will be created in `QUEST_LOCALPATH`.
* `AM_I_ON_SHARED_SERVER` - If set to `True` or `1`, QUEST will limit its resource usage (see details in `__init__.py` -- make sure to customize this to your needs!).
* `TORCH_SEED` - Sets the overall seed for `PyTorch`. If this is not set, the seed defaults to `42`. If negative, no seed is set. Otherwise, the seed will be set to the value of this variable.
* `TORCH_DEBUG` - Effectively sets `torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)`. This should only be used to debug issues with the model, as it greatly slows down any PyTorch operation.

Environment variables can be set (for example, in `bash`) using the `export` command:

```bash
export QUEST_LOCALPATH="/path/to/your/cache/folder"
```

Usage
-----
Head over to the `examples` folder, where we've included Jupyter notebooks showing how to load the model for inference, sample from it, or generate synthetic photometry.
