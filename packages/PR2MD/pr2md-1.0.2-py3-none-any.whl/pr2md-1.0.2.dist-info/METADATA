- üí¨ **Full Conversation Thread**: Captures all comments and discussions in chronological order
- ‚úÖ **Review Information**: Includes all code reviews with approval status and reviewer comments
- üíª **Code Comments**: Extracts inline review comments with their associated code context
- üìä **Change Statistics**: Displays files changed, additions, deletions, and commit information
- üîç **Complete Diffs**: Includes the full unified diff of all changes
- üé® **Beautiful Formatting**: Generates clean, readable Markdown with proper structure and syntax highlighting
- ‚ö° **Fast & Efficient**: Uses the official GitHub REST API with proper error handling
- üîí **Type-Safe**: Written in Python with comprehensive type annotations

## Installation

### Using pip (Recommended)

The easiest way to install PR2MD is directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install PR2MD
```

That's it! The `pr2md` command will be available in your terminal.

### From Source

Alternatively, you can install from source for development or to get the latest unreleased features:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tboy1337/PR2MD.git
cd PR2MD

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher
- `requests` library (automatically installed with pip)

## Quick Start

After installing via pip, you can immediately start using PR2MD:

```bash
# Extract a PR by URL
pr2md https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Save to a file
pr2md https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 -o output.md
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Extract a PR using its URL:

```bash
pr2md https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

Or specify the owner, repository, and PR number separately:

```bash
pr2md owner repo 123
```

### Save to File

Output the Markdown to a file instead of stdout:

```bash
pr2md https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 -o pr-details.md
pr2md owner repo 123 --output pr-analysis.md
```

### Verbose Logging

Enable detailed logging for debugging:

```bash
pr2md https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --verbose
```

### Help

View all available options:

```bash
pr2md --help
```

## Output Format

The generated Markdown document includes:

### 1. PR Header
- PR number, title, and status (Open/Closed/Merged)
- Author information with GitHub profile link
- Creation, update, closed, and merged timestamps
- Base and head branch information with commit SHAs
- Labels (if any)

### 2. Description
- The full PR description/body

### 3. Changes Summary
- Number of files changed
- Line additions and deletions

### 4. Code Diff
- Complete unified diff of all changes
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks

### 5. Conversation Thread
- All comments from the PR discussion
- Chronologically sorted
- Author attribution and timestamps
- Links back to GitHub

### 6. Reviews
- All submitted reviews
- Review state (Approved ‚úÖ, Changes Requested üî¥, Commented üí¨, etc.)
- Review comments and timestamps

### 7. Review Comments (Code Comments)
- Inline code review comments
- Grouped by file
- Includes code context (diff hunk)
- Reply chains preserved

## Example

```bash
# Extract PR #42 from the PR2MD repository
pr2md tboy1337 PR2MD 42 -o pr-42.md
```

This creates a file `pr-42.md` containing all the PR information in a beautifully formatted Markdown document.

## GitHub API Rate Limiting

The tool uses the GitHub REST API without authentication by default. GitHub imposes rate limits:

- **Unauthenticated requests**: 60 requests per hour
- **Authenticated requests**: 5,000 requests per hour

For most use cases, unauthenticated access is sufficient as the tool makes only a few API calls per PR. If you encounter rate limiting issues, the tool will provide clear error messages.

**Future Enhancement**: Authentication support is planned for a future release to enable higher rate limits and access to private repositories.

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

For development work, you'll need to install from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tboy1337/PR2MD.git
cd PR2MD

# Install the package in editable mode with development dependencies
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Design Principles

- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations throughout the codebase
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and edge cases
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Testability**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features or output formats

## Use Cases

- **Code Review Documentation**: Archive code reviews for compliance or historical reference
- **Offline Analysis**: Review PRs without internet connectivity
- **Pull Request Templates**: Learn from well-structured PRs
- **Change Management**: Document significant changes in projects
- **Training Materials**: Create educational resources from real-world code reviews
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain records of development decisions
- **Report Generation**: Include PR details in project reports

## Limitations

- Currently supports only public GitHub repositories (authentication coming soon)
- Rate limited by GitHub API (60 requests/hour without authentication)
- Requires internet connection to fetch data
- Large PRs with extensive diffs may generate very large Markdown files

## Roadmap

- [ ] GitHub authentication support (personal access tokens)
- [ ] Support for GitHub Enterprise
- [ ] Private repository access
- [ ] Batch processing of multiple PRs
- [ ] Custom output templates
- [ ] Additional output formats (HTML, PDF)
- [ ] Diff filtering and summarization
- [ ] PR comparison tool
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
