# Changelog

All notable changes to the `insyt-secure` package will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and follows the format from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.9] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed
- **Host Header Validation**: Fixed web dashboard rejecting valid hostname requests
  - Now accepts EC2 DNS names (e.g., `ec2-3-21-158-178.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com`)
  - Now accepts custom domain names and valid hostnames
  - Still blocks malicious host header injection attacks
  - Improved hostname validation regex to be more permissive for legitimate hostnames

## [0.6.8] - 2025-10-24

## [0.6.7] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed
- **Daemon Mode Crash**: Fixed daemon process immediately dying after start
  - Preserved working directory instead of changing to `/` (broke relative paths like `./data/`)
  - Added logging to `./logs/audit_web_daemon.log` for debugging daemon issues
  - Daemon now properly maintains access to configuration and database files

## [0.6.6] - 2025-10-24

### Changed
- **Default Network Binding**: Web dashboard now binds to `0.0.0.0` by default (all network interfaces)
  - **Breaking Change**: Previously defaulted to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
  - **Benefit**: Easier remote access for cloud/remote deployments (EC2, DigitalOcean, etc.)
  - **SSH Users**: Still accessible via `localhost:8080` when using VS Code Remote SSH or SSH port forwarding
  - **Security**: For localhost-only access, use `--host 127.0.0.1` flag
  - **Upgrade Note**: Existing `runtime_config.json` files will retain old `127.0.0.1` setting
    - Delete `./data/runtime_config.json` to adopt new default
    - Or manually edit the file to change `"host": "127.0.0.1"` to `"host": "0.0.0.0"`

### Documentation
- **README**: Updated with clearer access instructions for different scenarios
  - SSH tunnel access (VS Code Remote SSH users)
  - Direct IP access (remote deployments)
  - Network binding options and security considerations

## [0.6.5] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- **Daemon Mode**: Web server can now run as a true background daemon
  - New `--daemon` flag to properly detach from terminal
  - Process survives SSH disconnection and terminal closure
  - Uses double-fork method for complete session independence
  - New `--stop` flag to cleanly stop daemon
  - New `--status` flag to check if daemon is running
  
### Fixed
- **Terminal Disconnect Issue**: Web server no longer dies when SSH session ends
  - Previously, even with `nohup`, process could receive SIGHUP and terminate
  - Now properly detaches from controlling terminal
  - Dashboard remains accessible after terminal disconnect
- **Duplicate Table Rows**: Fixed execution logs table showing duplicate entries
  - Removed duplicate `<tbody>` section that was rendering logs twice
  - Table now displays each log entry exactly once

### Enhanced
- **Process Management**: Better daemon lifecycle control
  - Proper PID file management
  - Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
  - Prevents multiple instances from running
  - Automatic cleanup of stale PID files
- **Dashboard UI**: Smarter column visibility in execution logs table
  - Project column automatically hidden when specific project is selected
  - Reduces redundancy and improves readability when filtering by project
  - Column shows when "All Projects" is selected

## [0.6.2] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- **Project Aliases**: Display friendly project names in audit dashboard
  - Fetches aliases from account service API endpoint `/api/v1/service/broker/project-aliases`
  - Shows format "Alias (Project-ID)" in dropdown and logs table
  - Graceful fallback to project ID if alias not found
  - Caches aliases for performance

### Enhanced
- **Dashboard UI**: Project selector and logs table now show meaningful project names
  - New `/api/project-aliases` endpoint for fetching aliases
  - Automatic alias loading on dashboard init
  - Improved user experience when managing multiple projects
  - Dropdown auto-resizes (200px-450px) to fit longer alias names without text cutoff

## [0.6.1] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- **Database Migration**: Fixed initialization error where `project_id` index creation was attempted before column migration
  - Moved index creation to after column migration to prevent "no such column" errors
  - Ensures seamless upgrade from pre-0.6.0 versions

### Changed
- **Data Retention**: Removed automatic deletion of NULL project_id logs during migration
  - Old audit logs are now preserved with NULL project_id values
  - New logs enforce project_id at application level
  - UI filters support viewing logs with or without project_id

## [0.6.0] - 2025-10-23

### Notes
- For audit logging to capture full context, MQTT messages should include:
