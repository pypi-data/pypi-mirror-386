===================
DFTracer Format
===================

At a high-level, DFTracer events are inspired by the `chrome tracing document`_.
The similarity to chrome tracing format is in the structure of each event type.
Specifically, we use complete and metadata events within DFTracer.
However, it does not strictly follow the format due to parallelization reasons. 
Essentially, the DFTracer format is as follows

.. code-block:: bash

    [ # Marking the start of the trace 
    JSON LINES
    ] # Marking the end of the trace 

The "[" and "]" are required only for perfetto format.
Each JSON line is an event of two types: a) Complete Events and b) Metadata Events


----------

----------------------------------------
Complete Events
----------------------------------------

A sample complete event looks like the following

.. code-block:: bash

    {"id":8,"name":"CUSTOM_BLOCK","cat":"CPP_APP","pid":3308801,"tid":6617602,"ts":1727286231145121,"dur":1000054,"ph":"X","args":{"hhash":39537,"p_idx":7,"key":0,"level":3}}

Here, "id" refers to the index of the record in the process.
"name" refers to the event name.
"cat" refers to category.
"pid" and "tid" are the process id and thread id, respectively.
"ts" and "dur" is the timestamp and duration of the event.
Finally, "args" is a dictionary of other events.

Within DFTracer, we store all filename, hostname, and string as hash values.
The actual value is stored as a separate Metadata Event.

----------------------------------------
Metadata Events
----------------------------------------

Within DFTracer, there are two types of metadata events. 
One is similar to the chrome tracing format, which modifies the name in the perfetto ui view. 
For this, we support process name (in case of MPI we show rank of the process) and thread name which shows process id.
Another type of metadata event supports are internal metadata events such as hash function. 
A sample hash event looks like the following

.. code-block:: bash

    {"id":1,"name":"HH","cat":"dftracer","pid":3487304,"tid":3487304,"ph":"M","args":{"name":"corona211","value":51242}}


Here, "name" is the type of hash. "HH" for hostname hash, "FH" for filename hash, "SH" for general string hash.
"args.name" refers to the string that was hashed.
Finally, the "value" refers to the hash value. 


Finally, there are custom metadata events to store auxiliary information. 
An example of such event is below.

.. code-block:: bash

    {"id":6,"name":"PR","cat":"dftracer","pid":3487304,"tid":6974608,"ph":"M","args":{"name":"core_affinity","value":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47]}}

Here, the "name" "PR" represents a metadata event for process and the args contain the metadata name and its value.
