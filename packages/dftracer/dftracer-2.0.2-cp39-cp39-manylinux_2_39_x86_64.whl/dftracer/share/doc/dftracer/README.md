## Overview

DFTracer is a tracing tool designed to capture both application-code and I/O-call level events from workflows. It provides a unified tracing interface, optimized trace format, and compression mechanism to enable efficient distributed analysis for large-scale AI-driven workloads.

## Prerequisites

Requirements for DFTracer

1. Python>=3.7
1. pybind11

Requirements for DFAnalyzer

1. bokeh>=2.4.2
1. dask>=2023.5.0
1. distributed
1. matplotlib>=3.7.3
1. numpy>=1.24.3
1. pandas>=2.0.3
1. pyarrow>=12.0.1
1. pybind11
1. python-intervals>=1.10.0.post1
1. rich>=13.6.0
1. seaborn>=0.13.2
1. [zindex_py](https://github.com/hariharan-devarajan/zindex.git)

## Installation

Users can easily install DFTracer using `pip`, the standard tool for installing Python packages. 
This method works for both native Python and Conda environments.

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install dftracer
pip install dftracer[dfanalyzer]
# if you want to use old version of DFAnalyzer
# pip install dftracer[dfanalyzer_old]
```

### From Github

```bash
DFTRACER_VERSION=develop
pip install git+https://github.com/LLNL/dftracer.git@${DFTRACER_VERSION}
pip install git+https://github.com/LLNL/dftracer.git@${DFTRACER_VERSION}#egg=dftracer[dfanalyzer]
# if you want to use old version of DFAnalyzer
# pip install git+https://github.com/LLNL/dftracer.git@${DFTRACER_VERSION}#egg=dftracer[dfanalyzer_old]
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LLNL/dftracer.git
cd dftracer
# You can skip this for installing the dev branch.
# for latest stable version use master branch.
git checkout tags/<Release> -b <Release>
pip install .
```

## Usage

```python
from dftracer.python import dftracer, dft_fn
log_inst = dftracer.initialize_log(logfile=None, data_dir=None, process_id=-1)
dft_fn = dft_fn("COMPUTE")

# Example of using function decorators
@dft_fn.log
def log_events(index):
    sleep(1)

# Example of function spawning and implicit I/O calls
def posix_calls(val):
    index, is_spawn = val
    path = f"{cwd}/data/demofile{index}.txt"
    f = open(path, "w+")
    f.write("Now the file has more content!")
    f.close()
    if is_spawn:
        print(f"Calling spawn on {index} with pid {os.getpid()}")
        log_inst.finalize() # This need to be called to correctly finalize DFTracer.
    else:
        print(f"Not calling spawn on {index} with pid {os.getpid()}")

# NPZ calls internally calls POSIX calls.
def npz_calls(index):
    path = f"{cwd}/data/demofile{index}.npz"
    if os.path.exists(path):
        os.remove(path)
    records = np.random.randint(255, size=(8, 8, 1024), dtype=np.uint8)
    record_labels = [0] * 1024
    np.savez(path, x=records, y=record_labels)

def main():
    log_events(0)
    npz_calls(1)
    with get_context('spawn').Pool(1, initializer=init) as pool:
        pool.map(posix_calls, ((2, True),))
    log_inst.finalize()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

For this example, as the `dftracer.initialize_log` do not pass `logfile` or `data_dir`, we need to set `DFTRACER_LOG_FILE` and `DFTRACER_DATA_DIR`.
By default the DFTracer mode is set to `FUNCTION`.
Example of running this configurations are:

```bash
# The process id, app_name and .pfw will be appended by DFTracer for each app and process.
# The name of the final log file will be ~/log_file-<APP_NAME>-<PID>.pfw
DFTRACER_LOG_FILE=~/log_file
# Colon separated paths to include in the tracing
DFTRACER_DATA_DIR=/dev/shm/:/p/gpfs1/$USER/dataset:$PWD/data
# Enable DFTracer
DFTRACER_ENABLE=1
```
