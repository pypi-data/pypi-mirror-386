    Background
    -----------

    Mathematically, the radiance field represented by a :class:`GaussianSplat3d` is defined as a sum of anisotropic 3D Gaussians,
    with view-dependent features represented using spherical harmonics. The radiance field :math:`R(x, v)` accepts as
    input a 3D position :math:`x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3` and a viewing direction :math:`v \\in \\mathbb{S}^2`, and is defined as:

    .. math::

        R(x, v) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} o_i \\cdot \\alpha_i(x) \\cdot SH(v; C_i)

        \\alpha_i(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(x - \\mu_i)^T \\Sigma_i^{-1} (x - \\mu_i)\\right)

        \\Sigma_i = R(q_i)^T \\cdot \\text{diag}(S_i) \\cdot R(q_i)

    where:

    - :math:`N` is the number of Gaussians (see :attr:`num_gaussians`).
    - :math:`\\mu_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3` is the mean of the i-th Gaussian (see :attr:`means`).
    - :math:`\\Sigma_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}` is the covariance matrix of the i-th Gaussian,
      defined by its scale diagonal scale :math:`S_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3` (see :attr:`scales`) and orientation
      quaternion :math:`q_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^4` (see :attr:`quats`).
    - :math:`o_i \\in [0, 1]` is the opacity of the i-th Gaussian (see :attr:`opacities`).
    - :math:`SH(v; C_i)` is the spherical harmonics function evaluated at direction :math:`v` with coefficients :math:`C_i`.
    - :math:`R(q_i)` is the rotation matrix corresponding to the quaternion :math:`q_i`.

    To render images from a :class:`GaussianSplat3d`, you volume render the radiance field using

    .. math::

        I(u, v) = \\int_{t \\in r(u, v)} T(t) R(r(t), d) dt

    where :math:`r(u, v)` is the camera ray through pixel :math:`(u, v)`, :math:`d` is the viewing direction of the ray,
    and :math:`T(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} R(r(s), s) ds\\right)` is the accumulated transmittance along the ray up to distance :math:`t`.

    and to render depths you compute

    .. math::

        D(u, v) = \\int_{t \\in r(u, v)} t \\cdot T(t) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} o_i \\cdot \\alpha_i(r(t), d) dt
