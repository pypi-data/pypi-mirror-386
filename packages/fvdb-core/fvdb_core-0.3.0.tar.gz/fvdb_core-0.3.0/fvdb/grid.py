class Grid:
    """
    A single sparse voxel grid with support for efficient operations.

    A :class:`Grid` represents a single sparse 3D voxel grid that can be processed
    efficiently on a GPU. The class provides methods for common operations like
    sampling, convolution, pooling, dilation, union, etc. It also provides more advanced features
    such as marching cubes, TSDF fusion, and fast ray marching.

    A :class:`Grid` does not store
    data itself, but rather the structure (or topology) of the sparse voxel grid. Voxel data
    (e.g., features, colors, densities) are stored separately as :class:`torch.Tensor` associated with
    the grid. This separation allows for flexibility in the type and number of channels of data with
    which a grid can be used to index into. This also allows multiple grids to share the same data
    storage if desired.

    When using a :class:`Grid`'s voxel coordinates, there are three important coordinate systems to be aware of:

    - **World Space**: The continuous 3D coordinate system in which the grid exists.
    - **Voxel Space**: The discrete voxel index system, where each voxel is identified by its integer indices (i, j, k).
    - **Index Space**: The linear indexing of active voxels in the grid's internal storage.

    At its core, a :class:`Grid` uses a very fast mapping from voxel space into index space to perform operations on a :class:`torch.Tensor` of
    data associated with the grid. This mapping allows for efficient access and manipulation of voxel data. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        voxel_coords = torch.tensor([[8, 7, 6], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], device="cuda")  # Voxel space coordinates

        # Create a Grid containing the voxels (8, 7, 6), (1, 2, 3), and (4, 5, 6) such that the voxels
        # have a world space size of 1x1x1, and where the [0, 0, 0] voxel in voxel space is at world space origin (0, 0, 0).
        grid = Grid.from_ijk(voxel_coords, voxel_size=1.0, origin=0.0, device="cuda")

        # Create some data associated with the grid - here we have 3 voxels and 2 channels per voxel
        voxel_data = torch.randn(grid.num_voxels, 2, device="cuda")  # Index space data

        # Map voxel space coordinates to index space
        indices = grid.ijk_to_index(voxel_coords)  # Shape: (3,)

        # Access the data for the specified voxel coordinates
        selected_data = voxel_data[indices]  # Shape: (3, 2)


    .. note::

        The grid is stored in a sparse format using `NanoVDB <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb/tree/feature/nanovdb>`_
        where only active (non-empty) voxels are allocated, making it extremely memory efficient for representing large volumes with sparse
        occupancy.

    .. note::

        A :class:`Grid` cannot be a nonexistent (grid_count==0) grid, for that you'd need a
        :class:`GridBatch` with batch_size=0. However, a :class:`Grid` can have zero voxels.

    .. note::

        The :class:`Grid` constructor is for internal use only, To create a :class:`Grid` with actual content, use the classmethods:

        - :meth:`from_dense()` for dense data
        - :meth:`from_dense_axis_aligned_bounds()` for dense defined by axis-aligned bounds
        - :meth:`from_grid_batch()` for a single grid from a grid batch
        - :meth:`from_ijk()` for voxel coordinates
        - :meth:`from_mesh()` for triangle meshes
        - :meth:`from_nearest_voxels_to_points()` for nearest voxel mapping
        - :meth:`from_points()` for point clouds

        This is the "C Major" (channels major) version, which assumes the ``dense_data`` is in CXYZ order. *i.e* the
        dense tensor has shape ``[channels*, dense_size_x, dense_size_y, dense_size_z]``.

        This method creates the dense tensor to return, and fills it with values from the sparse grid
        within the range defined by ``min_coord`` and ``grid_size``.
        Voxels not present in the sparse grid are filled with zeros. *.i.e.* this method will copy
        all the voxel values in the range ``[min_coord, min_coord + grid_size)`` into a dense tensor
        of shape ``[channels*, dense_size_x, dense_size_y, dense_size_z]``, such that ``min_coord``
        maps to index ``(0, 0, 0)`` in the dense tensor, and ``min_coord + grid_size - 1`` maps to index
        ``(dense_size_x - 1, dense_size_y - 1, dense_size_z - 1)`` in the dense tensor.

        .. note::

            This method supports backpropagation through the write operation.

                shape ``(3,)``, integer dtype, or ``None``. If ``None``, computed to fit all active
