    Return a set of line segments representing the edges of the active voxels in the grid.
    This can be useful for visualizing a :class:`~fvdb.Grid` as a wireframe.

    The line segments are represented by an ``(N, 3)`` tensor of vertices and an ``(M, 2)`` tensor of indices
    into the vertex tensor. such that each edge is defined by a pair of vertex indices, where
