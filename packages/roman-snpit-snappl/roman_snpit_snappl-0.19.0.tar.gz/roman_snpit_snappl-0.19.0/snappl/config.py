class Config:
    """Interface for yaml config file.

    Read a yaml file that might include other yaml files, and provide an
    interface. The top level of the yaml must be a dict. Only supports
    dicts, lists, and scalars.


    USAGE

    1. Instantiate a config object with

           confobj = Config.get()

       or

           confobj = Config.get(filename)

       in the former case, it will get the default file (see below).
       IMPORTANT : Do NOT instantiate a config item with "config=Config()".

       The default file: normally, the default file is specified in the
       environment variable SNPIT_CONFIG.  The first time you call
       Config.get() without any arguments, it will set the default
       config to be what it read from the file pointed to by
       $SNPIT_CONFIG, and return that config.  You can subvert this by
       calling Config.get(filename,setdefault=True).  In that case, it
       will read the file in filename, and set the config there to be
       the default config that you'll thereafter get when calling
       Config.get() without any arguments.

    2. (Optional.)  You can set things up so that (almost) anything in
       the config can be overridden on the command line.  You must be
       using argparse for this to work.  First, instantiate your
       argparse.ArgumentParser object and add your own arguments.  Next,
       call the augment_argparse() method of your config object.  Run
       the parse_args() method of your ArgumentParser, and then pass the
       return value to the parse_args() method of your config object.
       For example::

         from snappl.config import Config
         import argparse

         cfg = Config.get()

         parser = argparse.ArgumentParser( 'test.py', description='Do things' )
         parser.add_argument( "-m", "--my-argument", help="My argument; there may be more" )
         cfg.augment_argparse( parser )
         args = parser.parse_args()
         cfg.parse_args( args )

       Config.augment_argparse will add all of the "leaf node" config
       options as config arguments, using the fieldspec (see (3) below),
       replacing "." with "-".  Exception: if there is a list, it will
       not work down into the list, but will replace the whole list with
       as single multi-valued argument.  For example, if your config is::

          scalar: val

          dict:
            key1: val
            key2:
              subkey1: val
              subkey2: val
            list:
              - val
              - val2

       Then you when you call Config.augment_argparse, you will have new arguments::

           --scalar
           --dict-key1
           --dict-key2-subkey1
           --dict-key2-subkey2
           --dict-list   ( with nargs="*" )

       You should ignore these; when you call Config.parse_args, it will
       look for all of them.

    3. Get the value of something in your config with::

           configval = confobj.value( fieldspec )

       where fieldspec is just the field for a scalar, or .-separated
       fields for lists and dicts.  For lists, it must be a (0-offset)
       integer index.  For example, if the yaml files includes::

         storage:
           images:
             format: fits
             single_file: false
             name_convention: "{inst_name}_{date}_{time}_{section_id}_{filter}_{im_type}_{prov_hash:.6s}"

       then confobj.value("storage.images.format") will return
       "fits". You can also ask configobj.value for higher levels.  For
       example, config.value("storage.images") will return a dictionary::

          { "format": "fits",
            "single_file": False,
            "name_convention": "{inst_name}_{date}_{time}_{section_id}_{filter}_{im_type}_{prov_hash:.6s}"
          }

    4. Change a config value with::

           confobj.set_value( fieldspec, value )

       This only changes it for the running session, it does *not*
       affect the YAML files in storage.  This will usually not work.
       To use this, you must have set static to False when calling
       Config.get.  You should use this with great care, and if you're
       using it outside of tests, make sure to carefully evaluate your
       life choices.  The whole point of this config system is that it's
       an interface to config files, so if you're making runtime
       changes, then things are scary.


    CONFIG FILES

    This class reads yaml files (which can have other included yaml
    file).  The top level structure of a config file must be a
    dictionary.

    When reading a config file, it is processed as follows:

    The "current working config" starts as an empty dictionary ({}).
    When everything is done, it can be a big messy hierarchy.  Each key
    of the top level dictionary can have a value that is a scalar, a
    list, or a dictionary.  The structure is recursive; each element of
    each list can be a scalar, a list, or a dictionary, and the value
    associated with each key in each dictionary can itself be a scalar,
    a list, or a dictionary.

    A config file can have several special keys:

        preloads
        replaceable_preloads
        augments
        overrides
        destructive_appends
        appends

    The value associated with each key is a list of file paths relative
    to the directory where this file is found.  All of this can get
    quite complicated, so use a lot of caution when using it.  The
    safest thing to do is to only use preloads and augments.


    HOW PARSING THE CONFIGS WORK

    To really understand the following, you have to read "DEFINITION OF
    TERMS" below.  Repeating what is said above, and will be said again,
    all of this is very complicated, so to be safe you may wish to never
    use any of the special keys other than "preloads" and "augments".

    preloads is a list of files which are read first, in order, to make
      a config dictionary (called the "preload config dictionary").
      Files later in the list *augment* the config info from files
      earlier in the list.  This config dictionary is set aside for the
      time being.

    replaceable_preloads is list of files read next, in order, to make
      a new config dictionary (called the "working config dictionary").
      Files later in the list *destructive_append* files earlier in
      the list.

    The current file is parsed next.  It does a *destructive_append* on
      the working config dictionary (which will just be {} if there
      aren't any replaceable_prelaods).  Then, the working config
      dictionary *augments* the preload config dictionary, and the
      result is the new working config dictionary.

    augments is a list of files read next, in order.  Each one
      *augments* the current working dictionary.

    overrides is a list of files read next, in order.  Each one
      *overrides* the current working dictionary.

    destructive_appends is a list of files read next, in order.  Each
      one does a *destructive_append* on the current working dictionary.

    appends is a list of files read last.  Each one *appends* to the
      current working dictionary.

    Any file that's read can itself have the special keys indicating
    other files to include.  If there is any circular inclusion -- or,
    really, if any file is referred to more than once when the whole
    thing is being parsed -- that is an error and will raise an
    exception.  (This isn't a perfect protection.  You can do things
    with symbolic links to get around this and effectively have one file
    include another which then includes the first one again.  Just don't
    do that.)


    DEFINITION OF TERMS

    Above, the words "destructive_augment", "augment", "override", and
    "append" were used to describe how to combine information from two
    different files.  Exactly what happens is complicated; if you
    *really* want to know, see

      util/config.py::Config._merge_trees()

    Here's an attempt to define it.  For all the operations below, we
    are trying to combine two values-- call them the "left" value and
    "right" value.  Initially, that's the two dictionaries that are the
    top level things being combined, but later it might be something
    else.  To compare two values:

    augment
       This is the safest one.  If you try to set a config option that
       is already set, it will raise an exception.  This is what you use
       if you want to protect yourself against accidentally setting the
       same option in more than one file and not realizing it, which can
       lead to all kinds of confusion.  Indeed, if you're worried about
       this, *never* use anything other than preloads and augments.

       * If the left and right values have different types, types (scalar
         vs. list vs. dict), this is an error.  This will never happen
         at the very top level, because both left and right are
         dictionaries at the top level.

       * If the current item being compared is a list or a scalar, then
         this is an error; you're not allowed to replace an
         already-existing list or scalar config option.

       * If the current item being compared is a dictionary, then merge
         the two dictionaries.  Any keys in the right dictionary that
         aren't in the left dictionary are added to the left dictionary
         with the value from the right dictionary.  If a key is already
         in both dictionaries, then it recurses using the augment
         method.

    append
       Generally speaking, stuff in the right value is added to stuff in
       the left value, but nothing from the left value will be replaced.

       * If the current item being compared have different types (scalar
         vs. list vs. dict), this is an error.  This will never happen
         at the very top level, because both left and right are
         dictionaries at the top level.

       * If the item being compared is a list, then then the right list
         extends the left list.  (Literally using list.extend().)

       * If the item being compared is a scalar, then this is an error.

       * If the current item being compared is a dictionary, then merge
         the two dictionaries.  Any keys in the right dictionary that
         aren't in the left dictionary are added to the left dictionary
         with the value from the right dictionary.  If a key is already
         in both dictionaries, then it recurses using the append
         method.


    destructive_append
        Works much like augment with the exception that if the item
        being compared is a scalar, then the right value replaces the
        left value.

    override
       Generally speaking, when overriding, the right value replaces the
       left value, but there are wrinkles.

       * If the current item being compared have different types (scalar
         vs. list vs. dict), the new (right) value *replaces* the old
         (left) value.  This will never happen at the very top level,
         because both left and right are dictionaries at the top level.
         Be warned: you can wipe out entire trees of config options
         here!  (Imagine if the left tree had a dictionary and the right
         tree had a scalar.)

       * If the current item being compared is a dictionary, then
         the dictionaries are merged in exactly the same manner
         as "append", with the modification that recursing down
         into the dictionary passes along the fact that we're
         overriding rather than append.

       * If the current item being compared is a list, then the
         right list *replaces* the left list.  (This could
         potentially throw away a gigantic hierarchy if lists
         and dicts and scalars from the left wide, which is as
         designed.)

       * If the item being compared is a scalar, then the right value
         replaces the left value.

    This can be very confusing, so keeping your config files simple.


   WARNINGS

    * Won't work with any old yaml file.  Top level must be a dictionary.
      Don't name your dictionary fields as numbers, as the code will then
      detect it as a list rather than a dict.

    * The yaml parser seems to be parsing "yyyy-mm-dd" strings as a
      datetime.date; beware.

    * python's yaml reading of floats is broken.  It will read 1e10 as a
      string, not a float.  Write 1.0e+10 to make it work right.  There
      are two things here: the first is the + after e (which, I think
      *is* part of the yaml spec, even though we can freely omit that +
      in Python and C).  The second is the decimal point; the YAML spec
      says it's not necessary, but python won't recognize it as a float
      without it.

            raised).

        setdefault : bool, default None
            Avoid use of this, as it is mucking about with global
            variables and as such can cause confusion.  If True, set the
            Config object read by this method to be the session default
            config.  If False, never set the Config object read by this
            method to be the session default config.  If not specified,
            which is usually what you want, then if configfile is None,
            the configfile in SNPIT_CONFIG will be read and set to the
            be the session default Config; if configfile is not None,
            read that config file, but don't make it the session default
            config.

            Normal usage of Config is to make a call early on to either
            Config.init() or Config.get() without parameters.  That will
            read the config file in SNPIT_CONFIG and make that the
            default config for the process.  If, for some reason, you
            want to read a different config file and make that the
            default config file for the process, then pass a configfile
            here and make setdefault True.  If, for some truly perverse
            reason, you want to the config in SNPIT_CONFIG but not
            set it to the session default, then call
            Config.get(setdefault=False), and question your life
            choices.

        static : bool, default True
            If True (the default), then you get one of the config object
            singletons described below.  In this case, it is not
            permitted to modify the config.  If False, you get back a
            clone of the config singleton, and that clone is not stored
            anywhere other than the return value.  In this case, you may
            modify the config.  Call Config.get(static=False) to get a
            modifiable version of the default config.

        clone : Config, default None
            If given, return a clone of this Config object.  The
            returned object, if all is working properly, is a deep copy,
            so it should be safe to mangle it.  It's not possibe to set
            a cloned config object as default, nor is the cloned object
            ever set as a singleton, so setdefault and static are both
            ignored and treated as False when making a clone.


        Returns
        -------
            Config object

        Config objects are stored as an array of singletons (as class
        variables of the Config class).  That is, if you pass a config
        file that has been passed before in the current execution
        context, you'll get back exactly the same object each time
        (unless static is True).  If you pass a config file that hasn't
        been passed before, it will read the indicated configuration
        file, cache an object associated with it for future calls, and
        return that object (unless static is False, in which case the
        the object is still cached, but you get a copy of that object
        rather than the object itself).

        If you don't pass a config file, then you will get back the
        default config object.  If there is no default config object
        (because neither Config.get() nor Config.init() have been called
        previously), and if the class is not configured with a "default
        default", then an exception will be raised.

        """Get a value from the config structure.


        Parameters
        ----------
        field: str
          The field specification, relative to the top level of the
          config.  So, to get the value of a keyword aligned to column 0
          of the config file, the field is just that keyword.  For
          trees, separate fields by periods.  If there is an array
          somewhere in the tree, then the array index as a number is the
          field for that branch.

           For example, if the config yaml file is;

           scalar: value

           dict1:
             dict2:
               sub1: 2level1
               sub2: 2level2

           dict3:
             list:
               - list0
               - list1

           then you could get values with:

           configobj.value( "scalar" ) --> returns "value"
           configobj.value( "dict1.dict2.sub2" ) --> returns "2level2"
           configobj.value( "dict3.list.1" ) --> returns "list1"

           You can also specify a branch to get back the rest of the
           subtree; for instance configobj.value( "dict1.dict2" ) would
           return the dictionary { "sub1": "2level1", "sub2": "2level2" }.

        default: object, default NoValue instance
            Used internally, don't muck with this.

        struct: dict, default None
            If passed, use this dictionary in place of the object's own
            config dictionary.  Avoid use.

        Returns
        -------
        int, float, str, list, or dict

          If a list or dict, you get a deep copy of the original list or
          dict.  As such, it's safe to modify the return value without
          worrying about changing the internal config.  (If you want to
          change the internal config, use set_value().)

        Specify one of omitkeys or keepkeys.

        Parameters
        ----------
          omitkeys: None, or list of str
            This is a list of keys to delete from the config before
            exporting it.  (The internal state of the config will not be
            affected, only what is exported.)  Be careful not to list a
            subkey of a key that's already earlier in the list, or
            you'll get errors.

            By default, the top-level key "system" is deleted, as per
            the Roman SNPIT standard that this holds all of the (but
            only the) system-specific config needed to run at a
            particular place.  (system should not include anything that
            changes the behavior of the code.)

            However, this default is a bit profligate, as it will keep
            all of the config options for all codes, not just the code
            you're running right now.  Use with thought.

          keepkeys: None, or list of str
            This is a list of keeps to keep in the export.  Currently,
            only top-level keys are supported.

        Returns
        -------
          dict
            This is a deep copy of the internal dictionary, so ideally
            you should be able to do anything you want to it without
            screwing up the internal config state.
