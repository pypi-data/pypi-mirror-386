            temporary tables) within the same connection.  Pass your
            DBCon to that function, and then in that function have it
            pass the DBCon to its DBCon constructor.

            There are implications.  The database connection will *not*
            be rolled back and closed when the context exits if you
            passed a non-None con.  The assumption is that there was an

            (the rows) and a list of strings (the column names).

            If None, then will inherit dictcursor from con, unless con
            is not a DBCon, in which case dictcursor will be treated as

            cached in the class, so the connection will only happen the
            first time you make an object of each subclass.)

          cols : list of str
            Column names.  Properties of self with these names will be created.

          vals : list
            Value that go with cols.

          **kwargs : additional arguments
            Instead of passing cols and vals, you can pass the
            properties to be set in the object as named parameters to
            __init__.

          _noinit : bool
            Don't actually initialize the object.  Use this if you just
            need an object and don't have any cols or vals to pass right
            now.  This is probably hardly ever useful, but there are all
            kinds of python games you might play.

          noconvert : bool, default True
            If True, assign the values in vals directly to the
            properties of self whose names are in cols.  If False,
            then vals will be run through the type converters for the
            columns, if any, to convert postgres types to python types.
            Set this to False if you're passing cols and vals as the

             the temp table before copying it over to the main table, in
