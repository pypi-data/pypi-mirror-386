        ----------
          process : str
            The name of the process, e.g. "phrosty", "campari", "import_rapid_alert", etc.

          major : int
            Semantic major version of the code described by process.

          minor : int
            Semantic minor version of the code described by process.

          params : Config or dict, default {}
            Parameters that uniquely define process. This should include
            all parameters that would be the same for all runs on one
            set of data.  So, for instance, for difference imaging
            transient detection software, you would *not* include the
            name of the science image or the name of the transient.
            However, you would include things like configuration
            parameters to SFFT, detection thresholds, and the name and
            parameters of however you decided to figure out which
            template image to use.

            You can also pass a snappl.config.Config object, in which
            case the parameters will be extracted from that.  This
            assumes that the "system" top level key of that Config has
            all, but only, the system-specific stuff.

          environment : int, default None
            Which SNPIT environment did the process use?  TODO: this
            still need to be defined.

          env_major : int, default None
            Semantic major version of environment.

          env_minor : int, default None
            Semantic minor version of environment.

          upstreams : list of Provenance
            Upstream provenances to this provenance.  Only include immediate upstreams;
            no need for upstreams of upstreams, as those will be tracked by the immedaite
            upstreams.  Can also send a single Provenance.

          omitkeys : list of str, default ['system']
            Ignored unless params is a Config object.  In this case,
            these are the keys from the Config to omit and not include
            in the parameters dictionary.  Only one of omitkeys or
            keepkeys can be non-None.

          keepkeys : list of str, default None
            Ignored unless params is a Config object.  In this case,
            only include the specified keys from the Config.
