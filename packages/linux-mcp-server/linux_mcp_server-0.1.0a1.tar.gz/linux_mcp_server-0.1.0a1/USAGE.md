- `top_n` (number, required): Number of largest directories to return (1-1000)

**Key Features:**
- Lists only immediate children (not nested paths)
- Sizes include all nested content recursively
- Fast performance using native `du` command
- Path validation prevents traversal attacks

**Example use cases:**
- "Find the top 5 largest directories in /var" → `list_directories_by_size("/var", 5)`
- "What are the 10 biggest directories under /home?" → `list_directories_by_size("/home", 10)`

- `reverse` (boolean, optional): Sort in reverse order (Z-A). Default: false (A-Z)

**Example use cases:**
- "List all directories in /home alphabetically" → `list_directories_by_name("/home")`
- "Show me directories in /var in reverse alphabetical order" → `list_directories_by_name("/var", true)`

#### `list_directories_by_modified_date`
Lists all immediate subdirectories under a specified path, sorted by modification date. Uses efficient Linux `find` command.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (string, required): Directory path to analyze

- "List directories in /var sorted by oldest first" → `list_directories_by_modified_date("/var", false)`
- "What directories in /tmp were changed recently?" → `list_directories_by_modified_date("/tmp", true)`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### `LINUX_MCP_ALLOWED_LOG_PATHS`
**Required for `read_log_file` tool**

Comma-separated list of log file paths that are allowed to be read.

**Example:**
```bash
export LINUX_MCP_ALLOWED_LOG_PATHS="/var/log/messages,/var/log/secure,/var/log/httpd/access_log,/var/log/httpd/error_log"
```

**Security:** This whitelist prevents access to arbitrary files on the system.

#### `LINUX_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`
**Optional**

Sets the logging level for the MCP server itself (not the system logs).

**Values:** DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

**Example:**
```bash
export LINUX_MCP_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

## Integration with Claude Desktop

Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linux-diagnostics": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/home/yourusername/linux-mcp-server",
        "run",
        "python",
        "-m",
        "linux_mcp_server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LINUX_MCP_ALLOWED_LOG_PATHS": "/var/log/messages,/var/log/secure,/var/log/audit/audit.log"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Troubleshooting Sessions

### High CPU Usage Investigation
1. "Show me the system CPU information and load averages" → `get_cpu_info`
2. "List all processes sorted by CPU usage" → `list_processes`
3. "Give me detailed info about process 12345" → `get_process_info`
4. "Show me the service status for httpd" → `get_service_status`

### Service Not Starting
1. "What's the status of the postgresql service?" → `get_service_status`
2. "Show me the last 100 logs for postgresql" → `get_service_logs`
3. "Show me error logs from the journal in the last hour" → `get_journal_logs`

### Network Connectivity Issues
1. "Show me all network interfaces and their status" → `get_network_interfaces`
2. "What ports are listening on this system?" → `get_listening_ports`
3. "Show me active network connections" → `get_network_connections`

### Disk Space Problems
1. "Show me disk usage for all filesystems" → `get_disk_usage`
2. "List all block devices" → `list_block_devices`
3. "Find the top 10 largest directories in /var" → `list_directories_by_size`
4. "What are the biggest directories under /home?" → `list_directories_by_size`
5. "List recently modified directories in /tmp" → `list_directories_by_modified_date`
6. "Show me system information including uptime" → `get_system_info`

### Detailed Disk Space Analysis
1. "Show me overall disk usage" → `get_disk_usage`
2. "Which directories under /var are using the most space?" → `list_directories_by_size("/var", 10)`
3. "What are the biggest directories under /home?" → `list_directories_by_size("/home", 20)`
4. "What's taking up space in the root filesystem?" → `list_directories_by_size("/", 5)`
5. "Show me all directories in /opt alphabetically" → `list_directories_by_name("/opt")`
6. "Which directories in /var/log were modified recently?" → `list_directories_by_modified_date("/var/log")`

## Security Considerations

### Read-Only Operations
All tools are strictly read-only. No modifications to the system are possible through this MCP server.

### Log File Access Control
The `read_log_file` tool uses a whitelist approach. Only files explicitly listed in `LINUX_MCP_ALLOWED_LOG_PATHS` can be accessed.

### Privileged Information
Some tools may require elevated privileges to show complete information:
- `get_audit_logs` - Requires read access to `/var/log/audit/audit.log`
- `get_network_connections` - May require root to see all connections
- `get_hardware_info` - Some hardware details (dmidecode) require root

### Recommended Approach
Run the MCP server with the minimum required privileges. Consider:
1. Adding the user to specific groups (e.g., `adm` for log access)
2. Using sudo only when necessary for specific diagnostics
3. Carefully curating the `LINUX_MCP_ALLOWED_LOG_PATHS` list

## Troubleshooting

### "systemctl command not found"
The system doesn't have systemd. This MCP server is designed for systemd-based Linux distributions like RHEL 7+, Fedora, Ubuntu 16.04+, etc.

### "Permission denied" errors
The user running the MCP server doesn't have permission to access certain resources. Consider:
- Adding the user to the `adm` group for log access
- Running with sudo for diagnostics requiring root
- Adjusting file permissions as needed

### No log files accessible with `read_log_file`
Set the `LINUX_MCP_ALLOWED_LOG_PATHS` environment variable before starting the server.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Use general tools like `get_system_info` before diving into specific diagnostics.

2. **Correlate Information**: Combine multiple tools for comprehensive diagnostics (e.g., process info + service status + logs).

3. **Time-Based Investigation**: Use `since` parameter in `get_journal_logs` to focus on recent events.

4. **Security First**: Only whitelist log files that are necessary for diagnostics.

5. **Regular Updates**: Keep the MCP server and its dependencies updated for security and compatibility.
