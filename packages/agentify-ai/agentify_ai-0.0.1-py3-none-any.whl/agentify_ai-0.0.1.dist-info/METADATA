# âœ¨ ðŸ¤– Agentify AI

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/agentify-ai)](https://pypi.org/project/agentify-ai)

Agentify AI is a Python and TypeScript library to develop and deploy an `Agent Driven Architecture` (ADA).

Agentify AI embraces [A2A](https://github.com/a2aproject) as [MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) (see [Ecosystem](#ecosystem) for alternative solutions) and can be deployed on your laptop or on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes).

The main features added to A2A and MCP are:

- Agent identity with Delegation
- Long running process with async tools
- Agent authorizations with permissions
- Controls with Guardrails
- Rich and custom user interactions with AG-UI
- Discovery with a Registry
- Observability with OpenTelemetry

An agent has:

- A public `Identity`.
- Some `Guardrails` defined by its `Manager`.
- Some `Tools`.
- Some `Skills` gained using the `Tools`.

An Agent:

- Interacts with other `Agents`.
- Reports to a single `Manager`.

An agent collaborates with a another Agent based its `Skills`.

## Identity

Outside Agents Identity is provided with:

- PKCI
- OAuth with automatic registration: Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591 / RFC 7592) allows clients (internal services, for example) to automatically register with an authorization server (AuthZ server) via an API, obtain their own client_id (and possibly secret or key pair) programmatically, optionally update or delete their registration later.

Inside Agents Identity is provided with:

- SPIFFE â€“ Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone - A set of standards for securely identifying software systems in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.
- SPIRE â€“ SPIFFE Runtime Environment - An implementation of SPIFFE that issues and manages identities (SVIDs) for workloads.
