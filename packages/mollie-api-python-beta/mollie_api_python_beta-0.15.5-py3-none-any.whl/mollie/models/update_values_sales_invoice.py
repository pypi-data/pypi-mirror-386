    r"""The status for the invoice to end up in.

    A `draft` invoice is not paid or not sent and can be updated after creation. Setting it to `issued` sends it to
    the recipient so they may then pay through our payment system. To skip our payment process, set this to `paid` to
    mark it as paid. It can then subsequently be sent as well, same as with `issued`.

    A status value that cannot be set but can be returned is `canceled`, for invoices which were
    issued, but then canceled. Currently this can only be done for invoices created in the dashboard.

    Dependent parameters:
    - `paymentDetails` is required if invoice should be set directly to `paid`
    - `customerId` and `mandateId` are required if a recurring payment should be used to set the invoice to `paid`
    - `emailDetails` optional for `issued` and `paid` to send the invoice by email
