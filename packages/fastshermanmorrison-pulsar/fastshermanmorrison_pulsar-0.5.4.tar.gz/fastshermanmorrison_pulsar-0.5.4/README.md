Cython code to more quickly evaluate ShermanMorrison combinations as need by
kernel ecorr in Enterprise.

# Installation

The FastShermanMorrison add-on to Enterprise can be easily installed straight
from github using

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nanograv/fastshermanmorrison.git
```

From Pypi, you can do

```bash
pip install fastshermanmorrison-pulsar
```

Conda support is in testing stage. Apple silicon arm processors are not supported yet, but on other architectures you can do

```
conda install -c vhaasteren fastshermanmorrison-pulsar
```

Availability on conda-forge is upcoming in a later release
