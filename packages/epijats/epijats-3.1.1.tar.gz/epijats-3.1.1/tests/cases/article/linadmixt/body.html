<p>We define <em>lineal admixture time</em> per lineage. This measure in time duration
   depends on two reference time points:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>a past time horizon when all ancestors are members of separate non-admixed
          subpopulations, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an observation time, such as the present.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Given a lineage, the <strong>lineal admixture time</strong> is defined as:</p>
<p><em>the amount of time since fertilization of the first admixed individual in the
     lineage</em>.</p>
