## Testing After Cleanup

All tests still pass:

```powershell
# Structure validation
PS> py agent_mem_mcp\test_server.py
✅ Server structure is correct!

# End-to-end test
PS> py test_mcp_client.py
✅ MCP Server Test Complete!

# Sample data generation
PS> py add_sample_data.py
✅ Sample Data Ready!
```

---

## Commands Reference (Updated)

### Run MCP Server
```powershell
py -m agent_mem_mcp
# or
py agent_mem_mcp\run.py
```

### Test MCP Server
```powershell
py test_mcp_client.py
```

### Test with MCP Inspector
```powershell
mcp dev mcp_dev.py
```

### Validate Structure
```powershell
py agent_mem_mcp\test_server.py
```

### Create Test Data
