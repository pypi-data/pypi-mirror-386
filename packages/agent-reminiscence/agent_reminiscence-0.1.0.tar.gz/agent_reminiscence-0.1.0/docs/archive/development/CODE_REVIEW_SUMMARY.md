2. What's your use case?
   - Development only → Phase 1 is enough
   - Production → Need Phase 1 + 2
   - Commercial → Need all 3 phases

3. What's your risk tolerance?

## 📝 Final Recommendations

### For Development Use (Now):
✅ **USE** with caution after Phase 1 fixes  
✅ **TEST** thoroughly before relying on it  
✅ **MONITOR** for errors and issues  

### For Production Use (Not Yet):
⚠️ **DON'T USE** until Phase 2 complete  
⚠️ **WAIT** for test coverage improvements  
⚠️ **PLAN** for 40-60 hours of improvements  

### For Commercial Use (Future):
🚫 **NOT READY** - needs all 3 phases  
📅 **TARGET** 2-4 weeks from now  
🔒 **REQUIRES** full security audit
