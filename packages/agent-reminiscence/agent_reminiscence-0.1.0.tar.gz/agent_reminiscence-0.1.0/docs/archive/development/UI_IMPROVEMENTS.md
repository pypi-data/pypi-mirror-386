python streamlit_app/run_ui.py

# Or from streamlit_app directory
cd streamlit_app
python run_ui.py
```

- ✅ `test_delete_nonexistent_memory()` - Tests error handling
- ✅ Verifies memory is removed from list after deletion
- ✅ Tests success/failure return values

**Total Tests**: 12 integration tests (8 functionality + 4 error handling)
