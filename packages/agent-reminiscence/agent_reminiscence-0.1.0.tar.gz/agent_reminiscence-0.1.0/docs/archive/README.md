## üîç Why Archive?

These documents are archived rather than deleted because they:

1. **Provide Historical Context**: Show how design decisions evolved
2. **Document Refactoring**: Explain why certain changes were made
3. **Reference Implementation**: Contain detailed technical notes
4. **Audit Trail**: Track progress and decision-making process

However, they may contain:
- ‚ùå Outdated implementation details
- ‚ùå Deprecated API examples
- ‚ùå Superseded architectural decisions
- ‚ùå Old file/function names

## üìù Archive Maintenance

### When to Archive

Archive documents when:
- Creating revised versions of existing docs
- Completing major refactoring that invalidates old docs
- Phase completion notes become historical

### What to Keep Current

Keep in parent `docs/` directory:
- User guides (GETTING_STARTED, ARCHITECTURE, DEVELOPMENT)
- Current implementation status
- Latest phase documentation
- API references

### Naming Convention

Archived documents keep their original names to maintain historical context and make it easy to track versions.
