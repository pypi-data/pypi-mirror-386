# This file contains pip version constraints that arise due to security concerns.
# This allows us to specify security-safe versions of packages even if the
# packages are not direct dependencies for us.
#
# Security constraints for direct dependencies should go in the appropriate `.in`
# file (or constraints-direct.txt) with an appropriate note.
