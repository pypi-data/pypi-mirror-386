# This file contains pip package version constraints that are needed to ensure
# compatibility across the various requirements*.in files.
#
# This should only be used when we have an indirect dependency version clash
# (direct dependency clashes should be addressed in the requirements files or
# constraints-direct.txt).
#
# These should be checked regularly to see if they are still required.

# Cannot install aiohttp==3.9.3 and aiohttp>=3.9.5 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
# Due to fsspec pinning on 3.9.3
aiohttp>=3.9.5

# This version or higher introduces mypy compatibility
ipython>=8.8.0

# This version is needed to ensure Windows OpenDP install
# https://github.com/opendp/opendp/issues/1885
