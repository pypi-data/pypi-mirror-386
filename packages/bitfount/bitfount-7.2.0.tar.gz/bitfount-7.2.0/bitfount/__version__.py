__changelog__ = """
- 7.39.0:
    - Renaming of NextGenPatientInfoDownloadAlgorithm to EHRPatientInfoDownloadAlgorithm
- 7.38.0:
    - Introduction of ImageSelectionAlgorithm.
- 7.37.1:
    - Allow ReduceCSVAlgorithmCharcoal to have templated variables.
- 7.37.0:
    - Added parameters to ReduceCSVAlgorithmCharcoal: eligible_only and delete_intermediate
- 7.36.0:
    - Introduction of S3UploadAlgorithm.
- 7.35.0:
    - Added enable_anonymized_tracker_upload to task definition. If missing, it will default to False.
- 7.34.0:
    - Deprecated save_path arguments in various algorithm schemas.
- 7.33.0:
    - Addition of argument back to EHRPatientQueryAlgo
- 7.32.0:
    - Added ehr_config in pod config
    - Removal of URL arguments to EHRPatientQueryAlgo
- 7.31.0:
    - Added exclusion codes to TrialInclusionCriteriaMatchAlgorithmBronze
- 7.30.1:
    - Fixed a bug in the types of some templated fields.
- 7.30.0:
    - Added support for templated strings in the YAML configs.
- 7.29.0:
    - Added support for saving results to a file to ResultsOnly protocol
    - Added support for running SQL query remotely to SqlQuery algorithm
- 7.28.0:
    - Changed NextGenPatientQueryAlgo to generic EHRPatientQueryAlgo (not a breaking change
      as there are no references to NextGenPatientQueryAlgo are out in the wild yet)
- 7.27.0:
    - Added support for indicating whether to re-run or not a task on previously failed files.
- 7.26.0:
    - Add FluidVolumeScreeningProtocol
- 7.25.0:
    - Added OMOP datasource
- 7.24.0:
    - Adds the ability for multiple secrets to be supplied in the YAML configs, with
      their intended usage being specified in the YAML.
- 7.23.0:
    - Removes JWT-based authentication from the YAML configs. This is not a breaking
      change as this was never actually working from the YAML due to the need for the
      JWT to have a callback specified.
- 7.22.0:
    - Add FluidVolumeCalculationAlgorithm
- 7.21.0:
    - Added new protocol GAScreeningProtocolBronzeWithEHRConfig
    - Added aux_col as argument to CSVReportGeneratorOphthalmologyAlgorithmArgumentsConfig
- 7.20.0:
    - Added inclusion and exclusion codes as input to TrialInclusionCriteriaMatchAlgorithmCharcoal
- 7.19.0:
    - Add InSite Insights protocol
- 7.18.0:
    - Add user defined primary_results_path
- 7.17.1:
    - Removed ICD10/CPT4 arguments from NextGenPatientQueryAlgorithm
- 7.17.0:
    - Add GAScreeningProtocolCharcoal protocol
- 7.16.0:
    - Add more configurable options to BscanImageAndMaskGenerationAlgorithm
- 7.15.0:
    - Add DataExtractionProtocolCharcoal protocol
- 7.14.0:
    - Add NextGenPatientInfoDownloadAlgorithm
- 7.13.0:
    - Add support for iterative splitting to PercentageSplitter
- 7.12.0:
    - Add support for test_runs as part of the modeller config.
- 7.11.0:
    - Add Reduced CSV Algorithm for Charcoal
- 7.10.0:
    - Add fovea capabilities to Charcoal algorithm
- 7.9.0:
    - Add Config for Charcoal Trial Inclusion
- 7.8.0:
    - Adds support for boolean as task template variables.
- 7.7.0:
  - Added InferenceAndImageOutput protocol
- 7.6.0:
  - Introduced new bscan image and mask generation algorithm.
- 7.5.0:
  - Add largest lesion upper size bound and patient age bounds to trial inclusion algorithms.
- 7.4.0:
   - Added post-processing to ModelInference Algorithm.
- 7.3.0:
  - Amethyst to use Amethyst Trial Calculation
  - Addition of Charcoal Trial Calculation
- 7.2.0:
  - Adding Image Source
- 7.1.0:
    Modeller:
        - Introduced new pre-filtering algorithm.
- 7.0.0:
  - Complete redesign of YAML versioning system
  - Introduced role-specific version lists (__pod_yaml_versions__ and __modeller_yaml_versions__)
  - Decoupled pod and modeller configuration schemas
  - Maintained backward compatibility with __yaml_versions__ for legacy code
  - Reset version numbering for role-specific schemas to provide a clean starting point
- 6.6.0:
  - Add specifications for datasource and datasplitter (kw)arg dictionaries,
    to provide tighter specification of these items.
  - Fix typing of "save path", etc., instances to correctly be specced as string/null
    rather than types inferred from fields.Function()
  - Fix Optional[Union[X, Y]] specs to correctly allow None/null
  - Change Union parsing to export to anyOf instead of oneOf, to better match
    the expected Marshmallow behaviour.
  - Fix issue with Union[dict[...],...] fields not being correctly written to
    the spec if they didn't contain enums.
  - Fix enum dicts to ensure they are valid JSON Schema components.
  - Introduce typing for template elements to ensure that those are also adhered to.
- 6.5.0:
  - Added NextGenSearchProtocol protocol
  - Fix incorrect args config for _SimpleCSVAlgorithm
- 6.4.0:
  - Added NextGenPatientQuery algorithm
