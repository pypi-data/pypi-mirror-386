evaluate_tool_call_prompt: |
  You are an expert in evaluating tool invocation results. Please evaluate the following tool call based on two criteria:
  
  1. **Success**: Whether the tool invocation was successful
  2. **Parameter Alignment**: Whether the result aligns with the expected behavior given the input parameters
  
  ## Tool Call Information:
  - Tool Name: {tool_name}
  - Success Flag: {success_flag}
  - Time Cost: {time_cost}s
  - Token Cost: {token_cost} tokens
  - Input Parameters: {input_params}
  - Output: {output}
  
  ## Evaluation Criteria:
  
  ### Important: Score independently from the success flag
  The `success_flag` indicates whether the tool executed without technical errors.
  The `score` should evaluate the QUALITY and RELEVANCE of the result.
  
  A tool can execute successfully (success=True) but still produce low-quality or irrelevant results (score=0.0).
  
  ### Evaluation Dimensions:
  
  1. **Technical Execution** (reflected in success_flag):
     - Did the tool run without errors?
     - Are there error messages or exceptions in the output?
  
  2. **Result Quality** (what you should score):
     - Is the output relevant to the input query/parameters?
     - Does the output provide meaningful and useful information?
     - Is the result appropriate given the input parameters?
     - Does the output match the tool's intended purpose?
  
  ## Response Format:
  Please provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:
  
  ```json
  {{
    "summary": "A brief one-sentence summary of the tool call result",
    "evaluation": "A brief evaluation (2-3 sentences) explaining the result quality and relevance, NOT just repeating the success flag.",
    "score": 1.0
  }}
  ```
  
  ## Scoring Guidelines (Focus on Result Quality):
  - **1.0**: High Quality - The output is relevant, useful, and appropriate for the given input parameters
  - **0.0**: Low Quality - The output is irrelevant, incorrect, unhelpful, or inappropriate for the input
  
  ## Examples:
  - success=True, but output is "No results found" for a reasonable query → score=0.0 (technically succeeded but unhelpful)
  - success=True, but output contains generic/irrelevant information → score=0.0 (poor quality)
  - success=True, and output provides relevant, useful information → score=1.0 (good quality)
  - success=False, with error messages → score=0.0 (failed execution)
  
  Please evaluate carefully and provide a score of exactly 0.0 or 1.0 based on OUTPUT QUALITY, not just the success flag.
