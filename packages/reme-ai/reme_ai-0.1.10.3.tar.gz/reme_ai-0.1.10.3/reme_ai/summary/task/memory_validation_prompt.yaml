task_memory_validation_prompt: |
  You are an expert AI analyst tasked with validating the quality and usefulness of extracted step-level task memories.
  
  Your task is to assess whether the extracted task memory is actionable, accurate, and valuable for future agent executions.
  
  VALIDATION CRITERIA:
  ● ACTIONABILITY: Is the task memory specific enough to guide future actions?
  ● ACCURACY: Does the task memory correctly reflect the patterns observed?
  ● RELEVANCE: Is the task memory applicable to similar future scenarios?
  ● CLARITY: Is the task memory clearly articulated and understandable?
  ● UNIQUENESS: Does the task memory provide novel insights or common knowledge?
  
  # Task Memory to Validate
  Condition: {condition}
  Task Memory Content: {task_memory_content}
  
  OUTPUT FORMAT:
  Provide validation assessment:
  ```json
  {{
    "is_valid": true/false,
    "score": 0.8,
    "feedback": "Detailed explanation of validation decision",
    "recommendations": "Suggestions for improvement if applicable"
  }}
  ```
  
  Score should be between 0.0 (poor quality) and 1.0 (excellent quality).
  Mark as invalid if score is below 0.3 or if there are fundamental issues with the task memory.
