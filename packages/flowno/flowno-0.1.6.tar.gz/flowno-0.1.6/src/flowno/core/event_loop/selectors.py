"""
Socket abstraction for the Flowno event loop.

This module provides socket wrappers that integrate with Flowno's event loop system,
enabling non-blocking socket operations through coroutines. The wrappers allow socket
operations to be suspended and resumed by yielding command objects that the event loop
processes.

Key features:
    - Non-blocking socket operations through coroutines
    - Support for both plain and TLS/SSL sockets
    - Integration with Flowno's instrumentation system
    - Compatible with Flowno's event loop commands

Example usage:
    >>> from flowno import socket, spawn, sleep, EventLoop
    >>>
    >>> # Server coroutine
    >>> async def echo_server():
    ...     # Create a server socket
    ...     server_sock = socket()
    ...     server_sock.bind(('localhost', 8888))
    ...     server_sock.listen(1)
    ...     print("Server: Listening on port 8888")
    ...     
    ...     # Accept client connection (non-blocking)
    ...     client_sock, addr = await server_sock.accept()
    ...     print(f"Server: Client connected from {addr}")
    ...     
    ...     # Receive data from client (non-blocking)
    ...     data = await client_sock.recv(1024)
    ...     print(f"Server: Received: {data.decode()}")
    ...     
    ...     # Send response (non-blocking)
    ...     await client_sock.sendAll(b"Echo: " + data)
    ...     print("Server: Response sent")
    >>>
    >>> # Client coroutine
    >>> async def echo_client():
    ...     # Give the server time to start
    ...     await sleep(0.1)
    ...     
    ...     # Create a client socket
    ...     client_sock = socket()
    ...     
    ...     # Connect to server (non-blocking)
    ...     client_sock.connect(('localhost', 8888))
    ...     print("Client: Connected to server")
    ...     
    ...     # Send data (non-blocking)
    ...     message = b"Hello, world!"
    ...     await client_sock.sendAll(message)
    ...     print(f"Client: Sent: {message.decode()}")
    ...     
    ...     # Receive response (non-blocking)
    ...     response = await client_sock.recv(1024)
    ...     print(f"Client: Received: {response.decode()}")
    >>>
    >>> # Main coroutine that coordinates server and client
    >>> async def main():
    ...     # Start the server
    ...     server_task = await spawn(echo_server())
    ...     
    ...     # Start the client
    ...     client_task = await spawn(echo_client())
    ...     
    ...     # Wait for both tasks to complete
    ...     await server_task.join()
    ...     await client_task.join()
    ...     
    ...     print("Main: All tasks completed")
    >>>
    >>> # Run the example
    >>> event_loop = EventLoop()
    >>> event_loop.run_until_complete(main(), join=True)
    Server: Listening on port 8888
    Client: Connected to server
    Client: Sent: Hello, world!
    Server: Client connected from ('127.0.0.1', ...)
    Server: Received: Hello, world!
    Server: Response sent
    Client: Received: Echo: Hello, world!
    Main: All tasks completed
