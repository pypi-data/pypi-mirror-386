# Configuration options for how to run MOPAC

[docker]
# The code to use. This may maybe more than just the name of the code, and variables in
# braces {} will be expanded. For example:
#   code = mpiexec -np {NTASKS} lmp_mpi
# would expand {NTASKS} to the number of tasks and run the command

code = mopac

# The name and location of the Docker container to use, optionally with the version

container = ghcr.io/molssi-seamm/seamm-mopac:{version}

# In addition, you can specify the platform to use. This is useful on e.g. Macs with
# app silicon (M1, M3...) where the default platform is linux/arm64 but some containers
# are only available for linux/amd64.

# platform = linux/amd64

[local]
# The type of local installation to use. Options are:
#     conda: Use a conda environment
#   modules: Use the modules system
#     local: Use a local installation
#    docker: Use a Docker container
# By default SEAMM installs MOPAC using conda.

installation = conda

# The command line to use, which should start with the executable followed by any options.
# Variables in braces {} will be expanded. For example:
#
#   code = mpiexec -np {NTASKS} lmp_mpi
#
# would expand {NTASKS} to the number of tasks and run the command.
# For a 'local' installation, the command line should include the full path to the
# executable or it should be in the path. 

code = mopac

######################### conda section ############################
# The full path to the conda executable:

# The Conda environment to use. This is either the name or full path.

######################### modules section ############################
# The modules to load to run MOPAC, as a list of strings.
# For example, to load the modules mopac and openmpi, you would use:
#   modules = mopac openmpi

# modules = 

######################### local section ############################
# The full path to the MOPAC executable should be in the 'code' option.

######################### docker section ############################
# The name and location of the Docker container to use, optionally with the version.
# {version} will be expanded to the version of the plug-in.
