<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


dkinst is a simple installer mostly for my professional needs, in case I need a one-click installer for a library or a tool.
So, I will not search for a setup script/line or write one.
It is written in Python, currently supports 3.12. Hope to support newer versions in the near future.


<!-- AVAILABLE INSTALLERS -->
## Available Installers

You can check the 'installers' folder for the available installers.
Or execute in CMD:
```cmd
dkinst available
```


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation Windows

1. Install Python 3.12.10 or use the silent installer that will download and install it for you.<br>
    1.1. Download the file: /prereqs/install_python_as_admin_win.cmd<br>
    1.2. Run CMD as admin.<br>
    1.3. In CMD run the script with '3.12.10' argument:
    ```cmd
   install_python_as_admin.cmd 3.12.10
   ```
   <br>
2. Install the library using pip:
   ```cmd
   pip install dkinst
   ```
   <br>
3. Adding auto-completion in PowerShell shell (optional):
   ```cmd
   dkinst prereqs
   ```
   This will not work in CMD shell.
   The auto-completion lets you use TAB key to complete installer names and methods.
   Examples:
   ```cmd
    dkinst install PyC<TAB>
    dkinst in<TAB>
   ```
   The first example will complete to 'dkinst install PyCharm' and the second to 'dkinst install'.
   <br>
   
### Installation Linux
   
Ubuntu 24 already comes with python 3.12. This file will install dkinst globally using pipx.<br>
1. Download the file: /prereqs/install_dkinst_pipx_debian.sh<br>
2. Make the file executable:<br>
    ```sh
    chmod +x install_dkinst_pipx_debian.sh
    ```
3. Run the script (runs 'dkinst prereqs' in the end) to install dkinst globally with pipx:
    ```sh
    ./install_dkinst_pipx_debian.sh
    ```
   
### Uninstall Auto-completion
To uninstall the auto-completion from Linux terminals or Windows PowerShell shell (if installed) run:
   ```cmd
    dkinst prereqs-uninstall
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
