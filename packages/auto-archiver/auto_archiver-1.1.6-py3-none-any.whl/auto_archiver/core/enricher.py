"""
Base module for Enrichers â€“ modular components that enhance archived content by adding
context, metadata, or additional processing.

These add additional information to the context, such as screenshots, hashes, and metadata.
They are designed to work within the archiving pipeline, operating on `Metadata` objects after
the archiving step and before storage or formatting.

Enrichers are optional but highly useful for making the archived data more powerful.
