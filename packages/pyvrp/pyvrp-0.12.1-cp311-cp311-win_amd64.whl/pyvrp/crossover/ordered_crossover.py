) -> Solution:
    """
    Performs an ordered crossover (OX) operation between the two given parents.
    The clients between two randomly selected indices of the first route are
    copied into a new solution, and any missing clients that are present in the
    second route are then copied in as well. See [1]_ for details.

    .. warning::

       This operator explicitly assumes the problem instance is a TSP. You
       should use a different crossover operator if that is not the case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parents
        The two parent solutions to create an offspring from.
    data
        The problem instance.
    cost_evaluator
        Cost evaluator object. Unused by this operator.
    rng
        The random number generator to use.

    Returns
    -------
    Solution
        A new offspring.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When the given data instance is not a TSP, particularly, when there is
        more than one vehicle in the data.
