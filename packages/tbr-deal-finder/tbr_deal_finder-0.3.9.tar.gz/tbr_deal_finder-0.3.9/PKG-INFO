### Custom csv
If you've got your own CSV you're using to track your TBRs all you need are the following columns for it to be in a valid format
* `Title`
* `Authors`
* `Read Status`* (See below)
 
Optionally, you can add the `Read Status` column. Set `to-read` for all books you want to be tracked.
If you don't add this column the deal finder will run on ALL books in the CSV.

## F.A.Q.

### What is Whispersync pricing

Whispersync is Amazon's program that discounts audiobooks when you own the ebook.

The trick: This works with *any* ebook in your library‚Äîincluding Kindle Unlimited books. So you can add a KU ebook (even if you don't want it) to unlock a steep discount on the audiobook.

TBR Deal Finder automatically checks for Whispersync discounts. If you're a Kindle Unlimited member and the ebook is available in KU, it'll show you the discounted Audible price instead of the full price.

Happy deal hunting!
