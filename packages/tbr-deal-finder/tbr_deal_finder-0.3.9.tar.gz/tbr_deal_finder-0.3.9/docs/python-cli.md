## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

#### "Command not found: tbr-deal-finder"
**Problem**: pip installed to directory not in PATH

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Option 1: Use full Python module path
python3 -m tbr_deal_finder.cli setup
python3 -m tbr_deal_finder.cli latest-deals

# Option 2: Add pip bin to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Option 3: Use virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv tbr-env
source tbr-env/bin/activate
pip install tbr-deal-finder
```

#### "Permission denied" during installation
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Option 1: Install for current user only
pip3 install --user tbr-deal-finder

# Option 2: Use virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv tbr-env
source tbr-env/bin/activate
pip install tbr-deal-finder

# Option 3: Use sudo (not recommended)
sudo pip3 install tbr-deal-finder
```

#### Python version conflicts
```bash
# Use specific Python version
python3.13 -m pip install tbr-deal-finder
python3.13 -m tbr_deal_finder.cli setup

# Check available Python versions
ls /usr/bin/python*  # Linux/macOS
# or
py -0                # Windows
```

### Usage Issues

#### No deals found
**Possible causes and solutions**:
- **Check CSV format**: Ensure titles and authors match book listings
- **Adjust filters**: Lower discount threshold or raise price limit
- **Verify configuration**: Run `tbr-deal-finder setup` to review settings
- **Network issues**: Ensure internet connection is working

#### Configuration not saving
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check permissions on config directory
ls -la ~/.config/  # or equivalent on Windows

# Run setup again with verbose output
tbr-deal-finder setup

# Verify config file exists and is readable
# Config location varies by OS - check documentation
```

#### SSL/Certificate errors
```bash
# Update certificates
pip install --upgrade certifi

# Use trusted hosts if behind firewall
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org tbr-deal-finder
```

### Performance Issues

#### Slow deal checking
- **Network**: Check internet connection speed
- **Location**: Use locale closest to your region
- **Frequency**: Don't run too frequently (max once per hour)

#### Memory usage
- **Virtual Environment**: Use isolated environments
- **Python Version**: Ensure using supported Python 3.13+
- **System Resources**: Close other applications if needed

## üí° Advanced Usage

### Multiple Configurations
```bash
# Use different config files for different reading lists
tbr-deal-finder --config-file ~/work-books.config setup
tbr-deal-finder --config-file ~/personal-books.config setup
```

### Integration with Other Tools
```bash
# Use with grep for filtering
tbr-deal-finder active-deals | grep -i "audible"

# Count number of deals
tbr-deal-finder latest-deals | wc -l

# Extract just book titles
tbr-deal-finder active-deals | grep -E "^[A-Za-z]" | head -10
```

### Development and Testing
```bash
# Install development version from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/WillNye/tbr-deal-finder.git

# Install specific version
pip install tbr-deal-finder==0.2.1

# Install pre-release versions
