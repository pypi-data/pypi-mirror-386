text = "Thank you, Eddie. As Eddie said, we are embarking on a new chapter of entrepreneurship by investing in 2 strategic pillars of consumption in the AI + Cloud. These represent the 2 biggest long-term opportunities we are systematically pursuing. To reflect this sharpened focus, we have also adjusted our financial reporting accordingly. Starting from this quarter, we undertook a strategic combination of Taobao and Tmall Group, Ele.me and Fliggy into Alibaba China E-commerce Group, transforming our value proposition into a comprehensive consumption platform. This is not simply an organizational change. It's a major strategic investment aimed at redefining the consumer experience and unlock long-term value across our ecosystem. This quarter marked a meaningful progress on this front as we deepen investment in quick commerce and increasingly essential use case for capturing new demand and shaping future consumer experience. Our quick commerce business achieved key milestones while contributing to the 25% year-over-year growth in the Taobao app monthly active consumers in the first 3 weeks of August. In tandem, we are building the AI + Cloud infrastructure to support the next wave of technological transformation, positioning Alibaba as a key enabler of enterprise AI adoption across industries. Our cloud business delivered accelerated growth as segment revenue and revenue from external customers both grew 26%, driven by surge in AI demand and increased customer adoption of public cloud services to support AI workloads. At the same time, we remain focused on improving operating efficiency and profitability. In the quarter, AIDC delivered solid progress approaching breakeven while sustaining strong growth momentum. Now let's look at the financial results on a consolidated basis. Total revenue was RMB 247.7 billion. Excluding revenue from Sun Art and Intime, revenue on a like-for-like basis would have grown by 10% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA decreased 14%, primarily due to our strategic focus on scaling quick commerce to capture new consumption patterns and drive future monetization opportunities, partly offset by margin improvements across several businesses including AIDC and other units that made continued progress in operating efficiency. Our GAAP net income increased 76%, primarily due to the mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and the gain arising from the disposal of local consumer service business of Trendyol. Operating cash flow was RMB 20.7 billion. Free cash flow was an outflow of RMB 18.8 billion. This was mainly attributed to our accelerated pace on expanding AI + Cloud infrastructure as CapEx ramped up to approximately RMB 39 billion and investment in Taobao Instant Commerce backed by nearly USD 50 billion in net cash, a healthy and low leveraged balance sheet and our strong access to capital markets we have ample flexibility to support long-term strategic investments while maintaining financial resilience. This quarter, we bought back approximately 7 million ADSs for a total of USD 815 million under our share repurchase program. We remain committed to shareholders' return through a mix of share buybacks, dividends and investment for growth, and we will continue to adjust the pace in form of returns based on market conditions and strategic priorities. Now let's look at the segment results, starting with Alibaba China E-commerce Group. Revenue from Alibaba China E-commerce Group was RMB 140.1 billion, an increase of 10%. Customer management revenue of our e-commerce business increased by 10%, primarily driven by the improvement of take rate. We had a successful June 18 shopping festival, which delivered strong consumer growth on the Taobao app as we implemented user-friendly promotion mechanisms and increase the support for merchants that provide high-quality products and customer services. The number of 88VIP members, our high-spending consumers group continued to increase by double digits year-over-year, surpassing 53 million. Revenue from our quick commerce business increased 12%, mainly due to order growth as a result of rollout of Taobao Instant Commerce at the end of April. Since its launch, we have seen encouraging business progress reflecting strong user adoption and growing order momentum. In the meantime, we have expanded our product offerings and front warehouse coverage for nonfood categories as part of our efforts to improve user experience and enhance operating efficiency. We executed our plan to generate synergies between quick commerce and the rest of Alibaba's ecosystem by leveraging supply chain, users and membership benefits across our businesses. In August, Taobao app launched a tiered loyalty program that connects Alibaba Group's China e-commerce, quick commerce and travel platforms. The adjusted EBITDA from Alibaba China e-commerce group decreased by 21%. Excluding the investments in our quick commerce business, our Alibaba China e-commerce group EBITDA -- has grown year-over-year. Revenue from AIDC grew 19% primarily driven by strong performance in cross-border businesses. AIDC's adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed significantly approaching breakeven. As we continue to improve our operating efficiency, the UE of choice and the Trendyol's International business improved significantly on a sequential basis. Looking ahead, we are committed to enhancing operating and investment efficiency. As a result, our profitability will continue to improve. Cloud segment revenue grew by 26%, primarily driven by public cloud revenue growth. AI revenue continued its triple-digit growth as AI demand continues to grow rapidly, we are also seeing increasing demand of compute, storage and other public cloud services to support AI adoption. The adjusted EBITA margin remained relatively stable year-over-year at 8.8%. We will continue to invest in customer growth and the technological innovation, including AI products and services to increase cloud adoption for AI and maintain our market leadership. As previously mentioned, we have updated our segment reporting to better reflect our focus. We simplified the financial reporting structure by reclassifying Cainiao, Amap and Hujing DME into all others. All other segment revenue decreased by 28%, primarily due to the disposal of Sun Art and Intime. All other adjusted EBITDA was a loss of RMB 1.4 billion, primarily due to the increased investment in technology businesses, partly offset by the improved results of businesses, including Freshippo. The all other segment comprises a set of innovative initiatives including several strategic AI-driven technology infrastructure and businesses. While we continue to drive efficiency improvements across business lines, we are also investing in AI opportunities to maintain our competitive edge and to drive future growth. In closing, this quarter marked a meaningful progress in our strategic investment on 2 pillars that will power Alibaba's next phase of growth. Our comprehensive consumption platform and AI + Cloud infrastructure. In commerce, the integration of multiple businesses under Alibaba China E-commerce Group is driving stronger synergy across supply chains, user networks and membership programs, enabling us to better serve evolving consumer needs and capture long-term growth potential. In cloud, revenue growth accelerated on the back of robust AI-driven demand. As we expand infrastructure capacity, we are helping more customers deploy and the scale their AI workloads. We are investing with clarity and the conviction on the 2 historical opportunities ahead, AI and domestic consumption. Our commitment of RMB 380 billion technology investment reflects our long- term ambition to build infrastructure essential for AI proliferation, while our focused expansion in quick commerce is designed to unlock new demand and long-term consumption potential in China. With strong balance sheet, operating cash flow and business momentum, we are well positioned to support these investments, drive sustainable growth and strengthen core capabilities that would define Alibaba's future. Thank you. That's the end of our prepared remarks. We can open up for Q&A."
