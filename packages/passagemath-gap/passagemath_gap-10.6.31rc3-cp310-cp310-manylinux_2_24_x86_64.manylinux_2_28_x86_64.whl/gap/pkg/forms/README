This package provides:

-  A way to create and use sesquilinear and quadratic forms on 
   finite vector spaces.

-  An operation which finds an isometry between two forms of the same type

-  An operation which returns the forms left invariant by a matrix group.

INSTALLATION AND DEPENDENCIES

Just unpack one of the archives in the "pkg" subdirectory of your GAP 
installation. The archive is available in several formats:

   forms-x.y.tar.gz  
   forms-x.y-win.zip 
   forms-x.y.tar.bz2

Unpacking generates a subdirectory "forms". Then you can load the package
by typing in the GAP command line "LoadPackage("forms");". All documentation and
examples are included.

INSTALLATION *outside the GAP main directory*: When you don't have access to
the directory of your main GAP installation you can also install the package(s)
by unpacking inside a directory "MYGAPDIR/pkg", where "MYGAPDIR" is any path in
your home directory that you have access to. 

To use packages installed in "MYGAPDIR/pkg", do not forget to start gap with the
extra option '-l ";MYGAPDIR"'.

Have a lot of fun!
