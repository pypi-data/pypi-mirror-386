The GAP 4 package `StandardFF'
==============================

This package contains an implementation of *standard* generators of
finite fields and of cyclic subgroups in the multiplicative groups
of finite fields, as described in:

     Frank LÃ¼beck, Standard generators of finite fields and their 
     cyclic subgroups, Journal of Symbolic Computation, Vol 117,
     2023, p. 51-67
     (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsc.2022.11.001)
