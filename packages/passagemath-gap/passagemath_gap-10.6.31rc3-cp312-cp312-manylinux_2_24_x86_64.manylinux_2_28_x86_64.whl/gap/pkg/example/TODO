* Example of a dynamically loaded module (there is already src/hellod.c which 
creates a loadable module, but this will also require pulling some parts from 
the GAP developer's manual). Probably use a template prepared by Paul Smith
in Summer 2011.

* Example of the interfacing with the external binary while it is running 
(the current HelloWorld example just starts the binary and continues after
the binary finishes its work)
