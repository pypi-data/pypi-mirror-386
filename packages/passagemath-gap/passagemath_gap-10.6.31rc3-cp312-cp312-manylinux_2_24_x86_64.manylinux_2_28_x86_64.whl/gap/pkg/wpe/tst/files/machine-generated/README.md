# Machine-Generated Tests

This directory contains all tests generated by scripts contained in `dev/tests_gen`.

To generate these files, look at the instructions of `dev/tests_gen/README.md`

Do not edit these files manually, instead edit the corresponding script in `dev/tests_gen`,
indicated by a comment at the top of a test file.
