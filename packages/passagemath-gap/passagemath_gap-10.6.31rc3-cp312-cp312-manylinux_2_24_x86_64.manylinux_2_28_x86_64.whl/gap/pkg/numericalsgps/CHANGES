- Added GeneratorsOfKernelCongruence.
- Primitive elements of affine semigroups via Lawrence lifting (if normaliz or 4ti2 are not used) are now done via GeneratorsOfKernelCongruence instead of MinimalPresentationOfAffineSemigroup, since in this setting the generators of the kernel congruence are already a minimal presentation.
- Fixed bug in the definition of proportionally modular semigroups (affected the case a < c (in this case it should return the entire N) -- )
- The function AperyListOfNumericalSemigroup has been added. It has only a numerical semigroup as argument and does the same than AperyListOfNumericalSemigroupWRTElement when considered relative to the multiplicity (which is, by far, the most important case).

- GeneratorsOfNumericalSemigroupNC became a synonym of GeneratorsOfNumericalSemigroup. The former one had no interest. The name was kept for compatibility with code produced for previous versions.
- Small bug with InfoLevel 0 corrected.

- Added Moebius function associated to the poset defined by a numerical semigroup.
- Added functions for cyclotomic numerical semigroups.

- Added LFormsOfNumericalSemigroup.
- Added alternate catenary degrees: monotone, adjacent, equal, homogeneous.
- Added a new chapter for affine semigroups with functions designed for them (see manual).
- AsAffineSemigroup lets you see a numerical semigroup as an affine semigroup; whence use functions for affine semigroups with it.
