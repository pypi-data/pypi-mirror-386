# The GAP 4 package 'IBNP' 

## Introduction

The IBNP package provides methods for computing an involutive (Gr√∂bner) 
basis B for an ideal J over a polynomial ring R in both the commutative 
and noncommutative cases. Methods are also provided to involutively reduce 
a given polynomial to its normal form in R/J.

## Distribution

 * The 'IBNP' package may be obtained from the GitHub repository at:  
     <https://gap-packages.github.io/ibnp/>
