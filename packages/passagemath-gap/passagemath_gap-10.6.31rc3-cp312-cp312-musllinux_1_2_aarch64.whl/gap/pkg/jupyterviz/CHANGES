September 2018
 - First version of the package created

October 2018
 - Renamed to JupyterViz (from Jupyter-Viz) to respect GAP naming
   requirements
 - Submitted to official GAP package repository for inclusion in
   GAP 4.10

December 2018
 - Added high-level Plot() and PlotGraph() functions to make the package
   much easier to use
 - Now supports installing new visualization tools at runtime
 - More options supported and documented
 - Many more examples added to manual, some moved from external .ipynb file
 - Improved testing scripts

February 2019
 - Made the package independent of the Jupyter Notebook; it now detects
   whether it is being run in that environment or not, and configures itself
   appropriately (but can be reconfigured on the fly to a degree).
 - If being run from the GAP REPL, plotting functions create temporary HTML
   pages with visualizations in them and display them using the system's
   default web browser.

March 2019
 - Point release with a bug fix regarding rendering graphs from the REPL.
