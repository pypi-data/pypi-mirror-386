To construct classical braces of size, say, 100 this is what one needs to do:
Run the magma file 4gap.m and inside magma 

> MakeList4GAP(100, "Bsize100.dat");
> MakeList4GAP(101, "Bsize101.dat");
> MakeList4GAP(102, "Bsize102.dat");

This creates the list of braces of size 100,101 and 102. Now one needs to compress the data with 
the GAP file make.g:

gap> create_braces([100..102]);
