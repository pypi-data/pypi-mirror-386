- The function GUARANA.MO_G_CN_AddMultTable takes a bit of 
  time. (for Tr_8_O1 6 seconds). We could probably speed 
  this up. In the moment most time is needed for 
  GrpElmByExpsAndCollNC. 
  Also the function GUARANA.G_CN_NumberToExpVector seems to 
  be not very efficient. 

  Furhter it seems that the whole setup has still the potential 
  to be speeded up. 

- F_36 semdirect Aut1 
  shows a very strange behaviour. 
  The function Add_G_LieAuts needs 20 seconds which 
  is roughly a half of the whole setup. 
  Further it seems that using symbolic Log slows down the
  same function immensly !! 

- When should I set up the Mal'cev correspondence for C ?
