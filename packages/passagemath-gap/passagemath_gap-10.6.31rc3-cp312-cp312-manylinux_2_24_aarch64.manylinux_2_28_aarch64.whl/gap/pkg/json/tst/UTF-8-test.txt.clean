"UTF-8 decoder capability and stress test\n----------------------------------------\n\nMarkus Kuhn <http:\/\/www.cl.cam.ac.uk\/~mgk25\/> - 2015-08-28 - CC BY 4.0\n\nThis test file can help you examine, how your UTF-8 decoder handles\nvarious types of correct, malformed, or otherwise interesting UTF-8\nsequences. This file is not meant to be a conformance test. It does\nnot prescribe any particular outcome. Therefore, there is no way to\n\"pass\" or \"fail\" this test file, even though the text does suggest a\npreferable decoder behaviour at some places. Its aim is, instead, to\nhelp you think about, and test, the behaviour of your UTF-8 decoder on a\nsystematic collection of unusual inputs. Experience so far suggests\nthat most first-time authors of UTF-8 decoders find at least one\nserious problem in their decoder using this file.\n\nThe test lines below cover boundary conditions, malformed UTF-8\nsequences, as well as correctly encoded UTF-8 sequences of Unicode code\npoints that should never occur in a correct UTF-8 file.\n\nAccording to ISO 10646-1:2000, sections D.7 and 2.3c, a device\nreceiving UTF-8 shall interpret a \"malformed sequence in the same way\nthat it interprets a character that is outside the adopted subset\" and\n\"characters that are not within the adopted subset shall be indicated\nto the user\" by a receiving device. One commonly used approach in\nUTF-8 decoders is to replace any malformed UTF-8 sequence by a\nreplacement character (U+FFFD), which looks a bit like an inverted\nquestion mark, or a similar symbol. It might be a good idea to\nvisually distinguish a malformed UTF-8 sequence from a correctly\nencoded Unicode character that is just not available in the current\nfont but otherwise fully legal, even though ISO 10646-1 doesn't\nmandate this. In any case, just ignoring malformed sequences or\nunavailable characters does not conform to ISO 10646, will make\ndebugging more difficult, and can lead to user confusion.\n\nPlease check, whether a malformed UTF-8 sequence is (1) represented at\nall, (2) represented by exactly one single replacement character (or\nequivalent signal), and (3) the following quotation mark after an\nillegal UTF-8 sequence is correctly displayed, i.e. proper\nresynchronization takes place immediately after any malformed\nsequence. This file says \"THE END\" in the last line, so if you don't\nsee that, your decoder crashed somehow before, which should always be\ncause for concern.\n\nAll lines in this file are exactly 79 characters long (plus the line\nfeed). In addition, all lines end with \"|\", except for the two test\nlines 2.1.1 and 2.2.1, which contain non-printable ASCII controls\nU+0000 and U+007F. If you display this file with a fixed-width font,\nthese \"|\" characters should all line up in column 79 (right margin).\nThis allows you to test quickly, whether your UTF-8 decoder finds the\ncorrect number of characters in every line, that is whether each\nmalformed sequences is replaced by a single replacement character.\n\nNote that, as an alternative to the notion of malformed sequence used\nhere, it is also a perfectly acceptable (and in some situations even\npreferable) solution to represent each individual byte of a malformed\nsequence with a replacement character. If you follow this strategy in\nyour decoder, then please ignore the \"|\" column.\n\n\nHere come the tests:                                                          |\n
