# Simple line plot

The most common thing you might want to do is plot a function on
coordinate axes.  To do so, simply choose a list of $x$ values and
pass them to `Plot` with the function.

```
Plot( [1..50], NrSmallGroups );
```

The default plotting tool is `plotly`, but you can change that
easily, as later examples show.
