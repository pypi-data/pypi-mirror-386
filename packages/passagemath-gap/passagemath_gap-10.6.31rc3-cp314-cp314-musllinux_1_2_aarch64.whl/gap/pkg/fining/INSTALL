How to get and install FinInG.

1. Get the latest version of GAP on www.gap-system.org. Fining is one of the packages distributed with GAP. Choose
your appropriate archive: Unix or Windows.

2. Install GAP the way you like it.  At the end you should have a working GAP
distribution. The Windows archive contains precompiled binaries of the required packages,
so in case of using the windows distribution, start GAP and go to step 6.

3. Fining requires the package GAPDoc, genss, forms, grape, orb and cvec. All of them
are part of the official GAP distribution. GAPDoc is loaded by default, forms and genss will do not require
compilation, and will be loaded automatically when loading FinInG. The packages orb, cvec, grape and io
require compilation. Note that the io package is a requirement of orb and cvec.

4. To compile the packages orb, cvec, grape and io, locate their directory in the GAP installation, and run the
configure script, and then the 'make' command.

5. After succesfull compilation, restart GAP.

6. Load the FinInG package using the command LoadPackage("fining");

7. Please read section 1.4 for more details on the installation.
