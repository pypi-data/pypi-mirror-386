  degree up to 15 are as described in Conway/Hulpke/McKay (LMS. Journal
  Comp. Math, Vol 1.) and the sources quoted therein.
  Groups of degree up to 30 were determined by Hulpke (J.Symb.Comp). Groups of
  degree 32 were determined by Cannon and Holt (Exp.Math.). Groups of degree
  33-47 were determined by Holt.
