##  To create a test file, place GAP prompts, input and output exactly as
##  they must appear in the GAP session. Do not remove lines containing 
##  START_TEST and STOP_TEST statements.
##
##  The first line starts the test. START_TEST reinitializes the caches and 
##  the global random number generator, in order to be independent of the 
##  reading order of several test files. Furthermore, the assertion level 
##  is set to 2 by START_TEST and set back to the previous value in the 
##  subsequent STOP_TEST call.
##
##  The argument of STOP_TEST may be an arbitrary identifier string.
## 
gap> START_TEST("Example package: testall.tst");

# Note that you may use comments in the test file
# and also separate parts of the test by empty lines

# Check that the data are consistent
