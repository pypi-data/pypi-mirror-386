Please create a (maybe random) test suite for invoking the AutoDoc command.
We already have a nice testsuite for all comments possible, although Mohamed always
seems to find a way to crash them into void.

IDEAS: We need to collect all possible combinations to invoke the AutoDoc command. It should be no problem
to design a loop in GAP, but checking the output for differences might be painful. Also, what to do with entities? The following is a list of possible
valid inputs for the different option records, which might produce the desired output in all combinations. However, Murphys Law tells us that at least one of them will
break anyway. So good luck.

dir: * doc
     * nothing
     -> Both should produce the same output.
     
scaffold: * includes
          * appendix
          * bib
          * TitlePage: + ... Stuff, see GAPDoc.
          * document_class
          * latex_header_file
          * gapdoc_latex_options



Documenting C/C++/C# with AutoDoc:

Use comments of C/C++/C# before AutoDoc hashes, i.e. // #!.
You can also begin a whole comment section with /* and then end it with */.
Please don't put a AutoDoc hash in the same line as /* and */. If using the @AutoDocPlainText command,
you can get rid of the supersticious hashes. Please do *NOT* use the comment syntax with an asterisk at the
beginning of every line, it will mess up the markdown extension!
