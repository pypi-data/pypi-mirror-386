Overview of files changed in Version 3.0.0 in respect to ModIsom 2.5.3:

ModIsomExt refers to a GAP package written by Leo Margolis and Tobias Moede the functionality of which is now included in this package, cf. https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=114036&token=7391a74bb71a93524f0dc24d07e5330c3d3cdf6e and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaca.2022.100001.

Changed:
- detbins.gi: 
-- New invariants and new functions for all fields. Also new functions which do not need the order as input. 
-- Some of the existing functions now give more information, e.g. ConjugacyClassInfo or SandlingInfo
-- Many of the functions are now documented. This concerns both, new and unchanged functions

- checkbin.gi:  
-- Corrected mistake in main function as done in ModIsomExt. Basically, just copied the file from ModIsomExt
-- New functionality which allows application to bigger fields
-- Print info on time etc. as in ModIsomExt 

- fprint.gi: corrected mistake in function PowerBasisWeights as done in ModIsomExt

New files:
- collect.gi as given in ModIsomExt. Function to efficiently compute with Jennings bases in Loewy series quotients of the augmentation ideal
- Jennings bound functions which in ModIsomExt are in detbins.gi into new files jenningsBound.g and jenningsConjecture.g
- kernelsize.gi: to compute kernel sizes of power maps
- tabletoalgebrandback.gi: functions which allow to convert hence and forth between elements in the group algebra (or rather the augmentation ideal) and the corresponding table
- detbinsRT.gi: for the ring-theoretic functions of detbins.gi in ModIsom

Technical differences between ModIsom and ModIsomExt:
- ModIsom uses BindGlobal while ModIsomExt uses InstallMethod. --> Has been changed everywhere to BindGlobal
- Documentation is generated differently. ModIsom uses GAPMacro --> Fused

Concrete changes:

detbins.gi:
- RefinBins from ModIsomExt (i.e. to refine lists of groups and not only of ids)
- MIPConjugcayClassInfo from ModIsomExt (i.e. with the parameter of Parmenter-Polcino Milies)
- MIPJenningsInfo from ModIsomExt (i.e. incorporating Hertweck's G/D4(G) and better id recognition)
- MIPSandlingInfo from ModIsomExt (i.e. incorporating Baginski/Margolis-Moede on small group rings)
- BaginskiInfo from ModIsomExt, implementing Baginski99-results
- CenterDerivedInfo from ModIsomExt
- FrattiniInfo from ModIsomExt
- JenningsDerivedInfo from ModIsomExt
- BaginskiCarantiInfo from ModIsomExt
- NilpotencyClassInfo from ModIsomExt
- DimensionTwoCohomology from ModIsomExt

- MIPJenningsInfoAllFields, only subsequent Jennings quotients
- DimensionSecondHochschild, computes dimension of second Hochschild cohomology group
- IsCoveredByTheory extended from ModIsomExt with various new results
- IsCoveredByTheoryAllFields new function
- Theorem41MS22 new function for result from Margolis-Stanojkovski
- MaximalAbelianDirectFactor and MaximalElementaryAbelianDirectFactor new functions for canceling factors
- AgemoInvariantAllM and OmegaInvariantAllM and AgemoCenterInvariantAllM and NormalSubgroupsInfo new functions based on Garcia-Lucas and Margolis-Sakurai-Stanojkovski
- CyclicDerivedInfo and CyclicDerivedInfoAllFields new functions based on Garcia-Lucas-Del Rio-Stanojkovski and Garcia-Lucas-Del Rio
- MIPBinsByGTInternal changed from ModIsomExt to incorporate new invariants and option to shut off cohomology calculations
- MIPBinsByGT changes to 2-4 variables and with new invariants
- MIPBinsByGTAllFieldsInternal and MIPBinsByGTAllFields new functions for all fields
- MIPSplitGroupsByGroupTheoreticalInvariants and MIPSplitGroupsByGroupTheoreticalInvariantsNoCohomology and MIPSplitGroupsByGroupTheoreticalInvariantsAllFields and MIPSplitGroupsByGroupTheoreticalInvariantsAllFieldsNoCohomology new user friendly functions which only need list of groups as input


checkbin.gi:
- MIPBinSplit from ModIsomExt with change to allow to increase field
- MIPSplitGroupsByAlgebras new user friendly function with input list of groups (and optional number to increase field)

fprint.gi: correction of mistake in PowerBasisWeights as already done in ModIsomExt

collect.gi: like in ModIsomExt + new user friendly function ModIsomTable

detbinsRT.gi: functions in the second half of the old checkbin.gi

kernelsize.gi: compute kernel size of power map

jenningsBounds.g: functions on Jennings bound from ModIsomExt

tabletoalgebrandback.gi: MIPElementTableToAlgebra and MIPElementAlgebraToTable functions to convert elements between group algebra and table

Manual:
- many of the new functions have been documented as well as the changes in the previous functions. Also some functions which remain unchanged are now documented
