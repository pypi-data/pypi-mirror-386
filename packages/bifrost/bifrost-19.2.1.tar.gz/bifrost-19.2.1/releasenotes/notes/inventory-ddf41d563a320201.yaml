features:
  - |
    The dynamic DHCP inventory hostsdir is now created and enabled by default,
    even when ``inventory_dhcp`` is ``false``.
upgrade:
  - |
    An additional DNS hosts directory is no longer created by default in
    ``/etc/dnsmasq.d/bifrost.hosts.d`` when ``inventory_dhcp`` is ``true``.
    Set the new variable ``dnsmasq_additional_hostsdir`` to keep the previous
    behavior (you'll need ``dnsmasq_enable_dns=true`` to actually use it).
deprecations:
  - |
    The parameter ``disable_dnsmasq_dns`` has been deprecated in favor of
    the new parameter ``dnsmasq_enable_dns``.
