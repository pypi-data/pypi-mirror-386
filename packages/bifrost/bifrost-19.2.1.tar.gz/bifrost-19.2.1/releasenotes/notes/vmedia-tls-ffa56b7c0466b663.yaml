    Virtual media images are now protected by TLS when TLS support is enabled.
upgrade:
  - |
    If ``enable_tls`` is ``true``, virtual media images for Redfish,
    iDRAC-Redfish and iLO are now served via TLS using the Ironic's
    TLS certificate. If this is not desired, set the new option
    ``vmedia_enable_tls`` to ``false``.

    The new server's port can be configured via the new ``file_url_port_tls``
    option.
