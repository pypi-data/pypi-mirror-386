    Add a boolean variable ``enable_epel`` that allows to enable the epel
    repository for CentOS Stream 8/9. Since we need that only when
    building a debian-based IPA image, the default value is set to
    ``install_dib`` and its installation depends on the value of the
    dib_os_element used.
