upgrade:
  - |
    Modification to the Bifrost virtual environment (``/opt/stack/bifrost`` by
    default) will now need ``sudo`` as the directory is now owned by root.
  - |
    The deprecated and non-functioning variable ``ANSIBLE_INSTALL_ROOT`` is
    no longer supported.
fixes:
  - |
    The Bifrost virtual environment (``/opt/stack/bifrost`` by default) is no
    longer owned (and thus writable) by the regular user that started the
    installation.
