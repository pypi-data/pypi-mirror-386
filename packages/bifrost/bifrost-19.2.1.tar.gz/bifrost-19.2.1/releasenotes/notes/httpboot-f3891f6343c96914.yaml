upgrade:
  - |
    The location of the HTTP boot directory has been changed to
    ``/var/lib/ironic/httpboot``. Please avoid running cleanings or deployments
    during the upgrade, otherwise PXE booting may fail until Ironic rebuilds
    the iPXE configuration.

    Any custom images will not be migrated from the old location ``/httpboot``,
    please migrate them manually if needed. You may remove the old location
    after the upgrade.
fixes:
  - |
    Makes sure the image cache directories are on the same filesystem as
    the PXE/HTTP directories to avoid the "Invalid cross-device link" error.
