features:
  - |
    When ``enable_inspector`` is set to ``false`` (the default),
    the new built-in inspection implementation is now configured. Note that

    * The new implementation has not at the moment of writing achieved a
      complete feature parity with ironic-inspector: see
      https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/inspection/index.html
      for the available features.

    * Whether inspection actually runs is not defined by this parameter but
      rather by ``inspect_nodes`` (or the ``--inspect`` argument to
      ``./bifrost-cli enroll``).
upgrade:
  - |
    If ironic-inspector support is disabled via ``enable_inspector`` set to
    ``false``, the service will be stopped and removed on upgrade. Nodes that
    use the ``inspector`` inspect interface will be changed to ``agent`` when
    running online data migrations.
