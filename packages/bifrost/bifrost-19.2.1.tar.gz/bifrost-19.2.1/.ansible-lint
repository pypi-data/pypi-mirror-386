  # FIXME: gradually fix and remove these exclusions:
  - fqcn[action] # Use FQCN for module actions
  - fqcn[action-core] # Use FQCN for builtin actions
  - ignore-errors #  Use failed_when and specify error conditions instead of using ignore_errors
  - jinja[invalid] # Unrecognized type
  - meta-no-info # meta/main.yml should contain relevant info
  - meta-no-tags # Tags must contain lowercase letters and digits only
  - name[casing] #All names should start with an uppercase letter
  - name[missing] # All tasks should be named
  - name[play] # All plays should be named
  - name[template] # Jinja templates should only be at the end of 'name'
  - no-changed-when # Commands should not change things if nothing needs doing
  - risky-file-permissions #  File permissions unset or incorrect
  - var-naming # violates variable naming standards
  - yaml[comments] # Missing starting space in comment
  - yaml[empty-lines] # Too many blank lines
  - yaml[indentation] # Wrong indentation
  - yaml[line-length] # Line too long
  - yaml[truthy] # Truthy value should be one of [false, true]

  # NOTE(dtantsur): the following rules should likely stay excluded:
  - experimental
  - role-name  # Role name {} does not match ``^[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`` pattern'
  - package-latest # Package installs should not use latest
  - no-handler  # Tasks that run when changed should likely be handlers
