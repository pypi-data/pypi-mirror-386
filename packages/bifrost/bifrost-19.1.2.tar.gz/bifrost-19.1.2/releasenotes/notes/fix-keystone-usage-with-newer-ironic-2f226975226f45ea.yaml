    Fixes Bifrost's creation of accounts and Keystone account usage to align
    with the newer role based access control within Ironic. Ironic deprecated
    the legacy access policy, which utilized custom roles ``baremetal_admin``
    and ``baremetal_observer`` in the Wallaby release of OpenStack, and
    Bifrost now utilizes a mix of a project scoped and system scoped
    ``admin`` accounts with Keystone to facilitate authentication
    and authorization to resources.
