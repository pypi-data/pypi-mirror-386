upgrade:
  - |
    Switches to using the *snponly* binary for iPXE on UEFI instead of the
    default ``ipxe.efi``. This has been recommended by the Ironic project for
    some time since ``snponly.efi`` generally has more stable networking
    support. Change the ``ipxe_efi_binary`` variable to revert if needed.
  - |
    No longer installs the full iPXE binary (``ipxe.pxe``) that is not used by
    Ironic.
