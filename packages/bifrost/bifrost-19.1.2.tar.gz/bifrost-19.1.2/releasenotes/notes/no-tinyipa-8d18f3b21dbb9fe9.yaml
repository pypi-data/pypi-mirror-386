    TinyIPA (an IPA image based on TinyCoreLinux) is no longer used by default.
    Instead, a CentOS image `published by the Ironic community
    <https://tarballs.opendev.org/openstack/ironic-python-agent/dib/files/>`_
    is used, unless ``use_tinyipa`` is set to ``true``.

    The TinyIPA image is much lighter, but is not suitable for real bare metal
    machines because of lack of drivers.
