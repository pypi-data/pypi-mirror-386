## Typing stubs for braintree

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`braintree`](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_python) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `braintree`. This version of
`types-braintree` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`braintree==4.40.*`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/braintree`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/braintree)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.18.2
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.407

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`17bde1bd5e556de001adde3c2f340ba1c3581bd2`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/17bde1bd5e556de001adde3c2f340ba1c3581bd2).
