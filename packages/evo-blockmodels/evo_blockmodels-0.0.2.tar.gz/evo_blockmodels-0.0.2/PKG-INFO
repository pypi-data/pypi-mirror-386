# Evo Block Model API Client

The Block Model API provides the ability to manage and report on block models in your Evo workspaces. Enable your
product with Evo connected workflows by integrating with the Seequent Block Model API.

The Block Model API supports a range of sub-blocking options, and both full and partial updates to block models,
including updates of specified columns and/or sub-volumes. Block models are versioned, and the service supports
reporting on the material content of current or previous versions, and comparing the content between versions of
a block model.

## Pre-requisites

* Python ^3.10
* An [application registered in Bentley](https://developer.bentley.com/register/?product=seequent-evo)

## Installation

```shell
pip install evo-blockmodels
```

## Usage

See [the evo-sdk-common documentation](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-python-sdk/blob/main/packages/evo-sdk-common/README.md)
for information on how to authenticate, then select the organisation, hub and workspace that you would like to use.

### Interacting with the Geoscience Block Model API

To get up and running quickly with the Evo Block Models SDK, start by configuring your
[environment and API connector](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-python-sdk/blob/main/packages/evo-sdk-common/docs/quickstart.md).

```python
from evo.blockmodels import BlockModelAPIClient

service_client = BlockModelAPIClient(environment, connector)
service_health = await service_client.get_service_health()
service_health.raise_for_status()
```

For some interactive Jupyter notebook examples, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-python-sdk/tree/main/packages/evo-blockmodels/docs/examples).
