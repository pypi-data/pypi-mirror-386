"""Portacode SDK & CLI.

This package exposes a top-level `cli` entry-point for interacting with the
Portacode gateway and also provides programmatic helpers for managing user
configuration and network connections.

# NOTE: Use postponed evaluation of annotations to ensure type hints
# like `list[str]` are treated as strings on Python < 3.9. This allows
# the SDK/CLI to run on e.g. Ubuntu 20.04 (Python 3.8) without raising
# `TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable` at import time.

# Keep explicit type annotation while remaining compatible with Python < 3.9
