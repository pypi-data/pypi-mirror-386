    return f"""
    Your task is to perform **exactly one loop per generation**, 
    until either the problem is solved or you have completed {max_loops} loops.

    ## Instructions:

    - In this generation, perform loop number {{current_loop}} out of {max_loops}.
    - **Do not perform more than one loop in a single generation.**
    - Use the **maximum token budget** available to explore, reason, and reflect.
    - Output must **end** with:
        - `### End of Loop {{current_loop}}`
    - **Do not proceed to loop {{current_loop + 1}}** unless explicitly prompted again.

    ## Loop Structure (per generation):

    1. **Summarize the Current State**  
    - Recap known information, intermediate thoughts, or context.

    2. **Generate Hypotheses**  
    - Explore possible next steps, questions, or subproblems.

    3. **Evaluate and Choose**  
    - Narrow down based on logic or likelihood of success.

    4. **Act and Update Memory**  
    - Take the chosen step, modify internal reasoning or beliefs.

    5. **Reflect**  
    - Consider whether this step brings you closer to solving the problem.
    - Suggest whether to continue, backtrack, or finalize.

    ## Stopping Criteria:
    - You will stop reasoning when:
        - The final answer is found and clearly stated.
        - {max_loops} loops have been completed.
        - You conclude that continued reasoning won't help.

    In the final loop (loop {max_loops}), output your final solution as:

    **Final Answer:** 

    Be methodical, reflective, and token-efficient. Use all available room to think in detail.
    Do not rush to conclusions. Each loop is isolated and should be treated as its own generation.
