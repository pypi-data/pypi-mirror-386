class BatchedGridWorkflow:
    """
    A workflow class for executing tasks in a batched grid pattern.

    This class implements a batched grid workflow where multiple agents can execute
    tasks concurrently in a grid-like fashion. Each agent processes tasks independently,
    and the workflow can be run for multiple loops to enable iterative processing.

    The workflow supports:
    - Concurrent task execution across multiple agents
    - Configurable number of execution loops
    - Error handling and logging for robust operation
    - Unique identification and naming for workflow instances

    Attributes:
        id (str): Unique identifier for the workflow instance.
        name (str): Human-readable name for the workflow.
        description (str): Description of the workflow's purpose.
        agents (List[AgentType]): List of agents to execute tasks.
        max_loops (int): Maximum number of execution loops to perform.

    Example:
        >>> from swarms.structs.batched_grid_workflow import BatchedGridWorkflow
        >>> workflow = BatchedGridWorkflow(
        ...     name="Data Processing Workflow",
        ...     agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
        ...     max_loops=3
        ... )
        >>> results = workflow.run(["task1", "task2", "task3"])
