          mil_grid: The Military Grid Reference System is the geocoordinate standard used by NATO
              militaries for locating points on Earth. The MGRS is derived from the Universal
              Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid system and the Universal Polar Stereographic
              (UPS) grid system, but uses a different labeling convention. The MGRS is used as
              geocode for the entire Earth. Example of an milgrid coordinate, or grid
              reference, would be 4QFJ12345678, which consists of three parts: 4Q (grid zone
              designator, GZD) FJ (the 100,000-meter square identifier) 12345678 (numerical
              location; easting is 1234 and northing is 5678, in this case specifying a
              location with 10 m resolution).

          mil_grid_sys: Indicates the grid system used in the development of the milGrid coordinates.
              Values are:

              UPS - Universal Polar System

              UTM - Universal Transverse Mercator

              consult the data provider.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          pol_subdiv: Political subdivision in which the geographic coordinates reside. The specific
              usage and enumerations contained in this field may be found in the documentation
              provided in the referenceDoc field. If referenceDoc not provided, users may
              consult the data provider.

          rec_status: Validity and currency of the data in the record to be used in conjunction with
              the other elements in the record as defined by SOPs. Values are: A - Active I -
              Inactive K - Acknowledged L - Local Q - A nominated (NOM) or Data Change Request
              (DCR) record R - Production reduced by CMD decision W - Working Record.

          reference_doc: The reference documentiation that specifies the usage and enumerations contained
              in this record. If referenceDoc not provided, users may consult the data
              provider.

          res_prod: Responsible Producer - Organization that is responsible for the maintenance of
              the record.

          review_date: Date on which the data in the record was last reviewed by the responsible
              analyst for accuracy and currency. This date cannot be greater than the current
              date.

          stylized_unit: This field contains a value indicating whether the record is a stylized
              operating unit record (True) or a regular operating unit record (False). A
              stylized operating unit is a type of operating unit with one set of equipment
              that can be assigned to one or more superiors. A stylized operating unit is
              generally useful for lower echelon operating units where the number of operating
              units and types of equipment are equal for multiple organizations. In lieu of
              creating unique operating unit records for each operating unit, a template is
              created for the operating unit and its equipment. This template enables the user
              to assign the operating unit to multiple organizations.

          sym_code: A standard scheme for symbol coding enabling the transfer, display and use of
              symbols and graphics among information systems, as per MIL-STD 2525B, and
              supported by the element AFFILIATION.

          unit_identifier: An optional identifier for this operating unit that may be composed from items
              such as the originating organization, allegiance, one-up number, etc.

              operating unit record (True) or a regular operating unit record (False). A
              stylized operating unit is a type of operating unit with one set of equipment
              that can be assigned to one or more superiors. A stylized operating unit is
              generally useful for lower echelon operating units where the number of operating
              units and types of equipment are equal for multiple organizations. In lieu of
              creating unique operating unit records for each operating unit, a template is
              created for the operating unit and its equipment. This template enables the user
              to assign the operating unit to multiple organizations.

          mil_grid: The Military Grid Reference System is the geocoordinate standard used by NATO
              militaries for locating points on Earth. The MGRS is derived from the Universal
              Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid system and the Universal Polar Stereographic
              (UPS) grid system, but uses a different labeling convention. The MGRS is used as
              geocode for the entire Earth. Example of an milgrid coordinate, or grid
              reference, would be 4QFJ12345678, which consists of three parts: 4Q (grid zone
              designator, GZD) FJ (the 100,000-meter square identifier) 12345678 (numerical
              location; easting is 1234 and northing is 5678, in this case specifying a
              location with 10 m resolution).

          mil_grid_sys: Indicates the grid system used in the development of the milGrid coordinates.

              organized and equipped to perform. The specific usage and enumerations contained
              in this field may be found in the documentation provided in the referenceDoc
              field. If referenceDoc not provided, users may consult the data provider.

          oper_status: The Degree to which an operating unit is ready to perform the overall
              operational mission(s) for which it was organized and equipped. The specific
              usage and enumerations contained in this field may be found in the documentation
              provided in the referenceDoc field. If referenceDoc not provided, users may
              consult the data provider.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          pol_subdiv: Political subdivision in which the geographic coordinates reside. The specific
              usage and enumerations contained in this field may be found in the documentation
              provided in the referenceDoc field. If referenceDoc not provided, users may
              consult the data provider.

          rec_status: Validity and currency of the data in the record to be used in conjunction with
              the other elements in the record as defined by SOPs. Values are: A - Active I -
              Inactive K - Acknowledged L - Local Q - A nominated (NOM) or Data Change Request
              (DCR) record R - Production reduced by CMD decision W - Working Record.

          reference_doc: The reference documentiation that specifies the usage and enumerations contained

          stylized_unit: This field contains a value indicating whether the record is a stylized
              operating unit record (True) or a regular operating unit record (False). A
              stylized operating unit is a type of operating unit with one set of equipment
              that can be assigned to one or more superiors. A stylized operating unit is
              generally useful for lower echelon operating units where the number of operating
              units and types of equipment are equal for multiple organizations. In lieu of
              creating unique operating unit records for each operating unit, a template is
              created for the operating unit and its equipment. This template enables the user
              to assign the operating unit to multiple organizations.

          sym_code: A standard scheme for symbol coding enabling the transfer, display and use of
              symbols and graphics among information systems, as per MIL-STD 2525B, and
