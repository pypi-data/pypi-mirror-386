          norm_factor: The normalization factor that has already been applied to the index value prior
              to record ingest. Typically used to normalize the index value to a particular
              interval. Units of the normalization factor may vary depending on the provider
              of this data (REACH, POES, CEASE3, etc.).

          observed_baseline: Observed baseline values of the frequencies specified in the frequencies field,
              in solar flux units. The baseline values will be used to help detect abnormal
              readings from the sun that might indicate a flare or other solar activity.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_sensor_id: Optional identifier provided by the reporting source to indicate the sensor
              identifier which produced this data. This may be an internal identifier and not
              necessarily a valid sensor ID.

          rb_duration: The timespan over which the associated radiation belt index is factored. If
              rbDuration is null, a 24 hour duration should be assumed. Note: rbDuration
              defines the length of the time window for this data record. The time window
              start time is defined by sgiDate, and the time window end time is defined by
              sgiDate plus rbDuration.

          rb_index: The value of the radiation belt index. This is the ratio of current intensity of
              a radiation belt to long-term average value. It's long-term average should be
              close to 1. Depending on the type of belt sensor, this ratio may measure Flux
              (number of particles / (cm^2 sec energy solid-angle)), dose rate (rad per
              second), or relative counts of particles per time (counts per second). The index
              value may also be normalized, the normalization value typically represents an
              average of the sensor measurements taken within a region over a given time
              interval. See the normFactor field for the specific normalization factor, if
              provided.

          rb_region_code: Region code for the associated radiation belt index. This is the code associated

          norm_factor: The normalization factor that has already been applied to the index value prior
              to record ingest. Typically used to normalize the index value to a particular
              interval. Units of the normalization factor may vary depending on the provider
              of this data (REACH, POES, CEASE3, etc.).

          observed_baseline: Observed baseline values of the frequencies specified in the frequencies field,
              in solar flux units. The baseline values will be used to help detect abnormal
              readings from the sun that might indicate a flare or other solar activity.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_sensor_id: Optional identifier provided by the reporting source to indicate the sensor
              identifier which produced this data. This may be an internal identifier and not
              necessarily a valid sensor ID.

          rb_duration: The timespan over which the associated radiation belt index is factored. If
              rbDuration is null, a 24 hour duration should be assumed. Note: rbDuration
              defines the length of the time window for this data record. The time window
              start time is defined by sgiDate, and the time window end time is defined by
              sgiDate plus rbDuration.

          rb_index: The value of the radiation belt index. This is the ratio of current intensity of
              a radiation belt to long-term average value. It's long-term average should be
              close to 1. Depending on the type of belt sensor, this ratio may measure Flux
              (number of particles / (cm^2 sec energy solid-angle)), dose rate (rad per
              second), or relative counts of particles per time (counts per second). The index
              value may also be normalized, the normalization value typically represents an
              average of the sensor measurements taken within a region over a given time
              interval. See the normFactor field for the specific normalization factor, if
              provided.

          norm_factor: The normalization factor that has already been applied to the index value prior
              to record ingest. Typically used to normalize the index value to a particular
              interval. Units of the normalization factor may vary depending on the provider
              of this data (REACH, POES, CEASE3, etc.).

          observed_baseline: Observed baseline values of the frequencies specified in the frequencies field,
              in solar flux units. The baseline values will be used to help detect abnormal
              readings from the sun that might indicate a flare or other solar activity.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_sensor_id: Optional identifier provided by the reporting source to indicate the sensor
              identifier which produced this data. This may be an internal identifier and not
              necessarily a valid sensor ID.

          rb_duration: The timespan over which the associated radiation belt index is factored. If
              rbDuration is null, a 24 hour duration should be assumed. Note: rbDuration
              defines the length of the time window for this data record. The time window
              start time is defined by sgiDate, and the time window end time is defined by
              sgiDate plus rbDuration.

          rb_index: The value of the radiation belt index. This is the ratio of current intensity of
              a radiation belt to long-term average value. It's long-term average should be
              close to 1. Depending on the type of belt sensor, this ratio may measure Flux
              (number of particles / (cm^2 sec energy solid-angle)), dose rate (rad per
              second), or relative counts of particles per time (counts per second). The index
              value may also be normalized, the normalization value typically represents an
              average of the sensor measurements taken within a region over a given time
              interval. See the normFactor field for the specific normalization factor, if
              provided.

          norm_factor: The normalization factor that has already been applied to the index value prior
              to record ingest. Typically used to normalize the index value to a particular
              interval. Units of the normalization factor may vary depending on the provider
              of this data (REACH, POES, CEASE3, etc.).

          observed_baseline: Observed baseline values of the frequencies specified in the frequencies field,
              in solar flux units. The baseline values will be used to help detect abnormal
              readings from the sun that might indicate a flare or other solar activity.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_sensor_id: Optional identifier provided by the reporting source to indicate the sensor
              identifier which produced this data. This may be an internal identifier and not
              necessarily a valid sensor ID.

          rb_duration: The timespan over which the associated radiation belt index is factored. If
              rbDuration is null, a 24 hour duration should be assumed. Note: rbDuration
              defines the length of the time window for this data record. The time window
              start time is defined by sgiDate, and the time window end time is defined by
              sgiDate plus rbDuration.

          rb_index: The value of the radiation belt index. This is the ratio of current intensity of
              a radiation belt to long-term average value. It's long-term average should be
              close to 1. Depending on the type of belt sensor, this ratio may measure Flux
              (number of particles / (cm^2 sec energy solid-angle)), dose rate (rad per
              second), or relative counts of particles per time (counts per second). The index
              value may also be normalized, the normalization value typically represents an
              average of the sensor measurements taken within a region over a given time
              interval. See the normFactor field for the specific normalization factor, if
              provided.

          rb_region_code: Region code for the associated radiation belt index. This is the code associated
