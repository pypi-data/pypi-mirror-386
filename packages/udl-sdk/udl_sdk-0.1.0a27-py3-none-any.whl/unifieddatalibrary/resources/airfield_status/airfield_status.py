          rwy_cond_reading: The primary runway condition reading value used for determining runway braking
              action, from 0 to 26. A value of 0 indicates braking action is poor or
              non-existent, where a value of 26 indicates braking action is good.

          rwy_friction_factor: The primary runway friction factor which is dependent on the surface friction
              between the tires of the aircraft and the runway surface, from 0 to 100. A lower
              number indicates less friction and less braking response.

          rwy_markings: Array of markings currently on the primary runway.

          slot_types_req: Array of slot types that an airfield requires a particular aircraft provide in
              order to consume a slot at this location.

          survey_date: The date the airfield survey was performed, in ISO 8601 UTC format with
              millisecond precision.

          wide_parking_mog: Maximum on ground (MOG) number of parking wide-body aircraft based on spacing
              and manpower at the time of status. Additional information about this field as
              it pertains to specific aircraft type may be available in an associated
              SiteOperations record.

          wide_working_mog: Maximum on ground (MOG) number of working wide-body aircraft based on spacing
              and manpower at the time of status. Additional information about this field as
