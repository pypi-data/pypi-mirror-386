              'srcIds' arrays must match in size. See the corresponding srcTyps array element
              for the data type of the UUID and use the appropriate API operation to retrieve
              that object.

          src_typs: Array of UDL record types such as AIRCRAFT, VESSEL, EO, MTI that are related to
              this equipment record. See the associated 'srcIds' array for the record UUIDs,
