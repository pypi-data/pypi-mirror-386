              wake turbulence. Valid values include LIGHT, MEDIUM, LARGE, HEAVY, and SUPER.

          wind_fac1: Wind factor for the first half of the route. This is the average wind factor
              from first Top of Climb to the mid-time of the entire route in knots. A positive
              value indicates a headwind, while a negative value indicates a tailwind.

          wind_fac2: Wind factor for the second half of the route. This is the average wind factor
              from the mid-time of the entire route to last Top of Descent in knots. A

              tailwind.

          wind_fac_avg: Average wind factor from Top of Climb to Top of Descent in knots. A positive
