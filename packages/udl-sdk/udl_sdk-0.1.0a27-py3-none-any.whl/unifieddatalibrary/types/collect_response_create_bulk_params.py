    The status of the request (ACCEPTED, CANCELLED, COLLECTED, COMPLETED, DELIVERED,

    ACCEPTED: The collect or contact request has been received and accepted.

    CANCELLED: A previously scheduled collect or contact whose execution was
    cancelled.

    COLLECTED: The collect has been accomplished. A collected state implies that
    additional activity is required for delivery/completion.

    COMPLETED: The collect or contact has been completed. For many systems completed
    and delivered constitute an equivalent successful end state.

    DELIVERED: The collected observation(s) have been delivered to the requestor.
    For many systems completed and delivered constitute an equivalent successful end
    state. A DELIVERED state is typically used for systems that exhibit a delay
    between collect and delivery, such as with space-based systems which require
    ground contact to deliver observations.

    FAILED: The collect or contact was attempted and failed, or the delivery of the
    collected observation(s) failed. A FAILED status may be accompanied by an error
    code (errCode), if available.

    PARTIAL: A PARTIAL state indicates that a part of a multi-track request has been
    accomplished, but the full request is incomplete. A PARTIAL status should
    ultimately be resolved to an end state.

    PROPOSED: Indicates that the request was received and alternate collect or
    contact time(s) (altStartTime, altEndTime) have been proposed. If an alternate
    is accepted by the requestor the current request should be cancelled and a new
    request created.

    REJECTED: The request has been received and rejected by the provider. A REJECTED
    status may be accompanied by an explanation (notes) of the reason that the
    request was rejected.

    SCHEDULED: The request was received and has been scheduled for execution.
