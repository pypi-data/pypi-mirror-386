          mat_cat: The Radiological Category (1 - 5) which applies to the material associated with
              this detection, according to the following definitions:

              Category 1: If not safely or securely managed, would be likely to cause
              permanent injury to a person who handled them or was otherwise in contact with
              them for more than a few minutes. It would probably be fatal to be close to this
              amount of unshielded material for a period of a few minutes to an hour.

              Category 2: If not safely or securely managed, could cause permanent injury to a
              person who handled them or was otherwise in contact with them for a short time
              (minutes to hours). It could possibly be fatal to be close to this amount of
              unshielded radioactive material for a period of hours to days.

              Category 3: If not safely or securely managed, could cause permanent injury to a
              person who handled them or was otherwise in contact with them for hours. It
              could possibly - although it is unlikely to be - fatal to be close to this
              amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period of days to weeks.

              Category 4: If not safely managed or securely protected, could possibly cause
              temporary injury to someone who handled them or was otherwise in contact with or
              close to them for a period of many weeks, though this is unlikely. It is very
              unlikely anyone would be permanently injured by this amount of radioactive
              material.

              Category 5: Cannot cause permanent injury. This category applies to x-ray
              fluorescence devices and electron capture devices.

          mat_class: The specific Material Class for the material associated with this detect. The
              material class is generally associated with chemical and biological detections.

          mat_name: The material common name associated with this detection.

          mat_type: The specific material type (MT) or MT Code involved in this detection, when
              applicable. The material type is generally associated with radiological and/or
              nuclear detections. For further information, reference Nuclear Materials
              Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS) Users Guide Rev. 2.1.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          ppm: Measure of the concentration of the material associated with this detection, in
              parts per million (units of contaminant mass per million parts of total mass).

          rad_ctrn: Measure of radioactive concentration of the material associated with this
              detection, in becquerels/m^3. One becquerel (Bq) is equal to one nuclear decay
              per second.

          readings: Array of the specific readings associated with this detection. The readings,
              readingUnits, and readingValues arrays must contain the same number of elements.

          reading_units: Array of the units that correspond to each of the readingValues. The readings,
              readingUnits, and readingValues arrays must contain the same number of elements.

          reading_values: Array of the values that correspond to each of the readings contained in
              readings. The readings, readingUnits, and readingValues arrays must contain the
              same number of elements.

          mat_cat: The Radiological Category (1 - 5) which applies to the material associated with
              this detection, according to the following definitions:

              Category 1: If not safely or securely managed, would be likely to cause
              permanent injury to a person who handled them or was otherwise in contact with
              them for more than a few minutes. It would probably be fatal to be close to this
              amount of unshielded material for a period of a few minutes to an hour.

              Category 2: If not safely or securely managed, could cause permanent injury to a
              person who handled them or was otherwise in contact with them for a short time
              (minutes to hours). It could possibly be fatal to be close to this amount of
              unshielded radioactive material for a period of hours to days.

              Category 3: If not safely or securely managed, could cause permanent injury to a
              person who handled them or was otherwise in contact with them for hours. It
              could possibly - although it is unlikely to be - fatal to be close to this
              amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period of days to weeks.

              Category 4: If not safely managed or securely protected, could possibly cause
              temporary injury to someone who handled them or was otherwise in contact with or
              close to them for a period of many weeks, though this is unlikely. It is very
              unlikely anyone would be permanently injured by this amount of radioactive
              material.

              Category 5: Cannot cause permanent injury. This category applies to x-ray
              fluorescence devices and electron capture devices.

          mat_class: The specific Material Class for the material associated with this detect. The
              material class is generally associated with chemical and biological detections.

          mat_name: The material common name associated with this detection.

          mat_type: The specific material type (MT) or MT Code involved in this detection, when
              applicable. The material type is generally associated with radiological and/or
              nuclear detections. For further information, reference Nuclear Materials
              Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS) Users Guide Rev. 2.1.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          ppm: Measure of the concentration of the material associated with this detection, in
              parts per million (units of contaminant mass per million parts of total mass).

          rad_ctrn: Measure of radioactive concentration of the material associated with this
              detection, in becquerels/m^3. One becquerel (Bq) is equal to one nuclear decay
              per second.

          readings: Array of the specific readings associated with this detection. The readings,
              readingUnits, and readingValues arrays must contain the same number of elements.

          reading_units: Array of the units that correspond to each of the readingValues. The readings,
              readingUnits, and readingValues arrays must contain the same number of elements.

          reading_values: Array of the values that correspond to each of the readings contained in
              readings. The readings, readingUnits, and readingValues arrays must contain the
              same number of elements.
