              create operations.

          aircraft_mds: The aircraft Model Design Series (MDS) designation (e.g. E-2C HAWKEYE, F-15
              EAGLE, KC-130 HERCULES, etc.) of this aircraft. Intended as, but not constrained
              to, MIL-STD-6016 environment dependent specific type designations.

          curr_icao: The current ICAO of the aircraft that is the subject of this
              LogisticsSupportDetails record.

          etic: The estimated time mission capable for the aircraft, in ISO 8601 UCT format with
              millisecond precision. This is the estimated time when the aircraft is mission
              ready.

          etmc: Logistics estimated time mission capable.

          ext_system_id: Optional system identifier from external systs. This field has no meaning within
              UDL and is provided as a convenience for systems that require tracking of an
              internal system generated ID.

          logistic_action: This field identifies the pacing event for bringing the aircraft to Mission
              Capable status. It is used in calculating the Estimated Time Mission Capable
              (ETMC) value. Acceptable values are WA (Will Advise), INW (In Work), P+hhh.h
              (where P=parts and hhh.h is the number of hours up to 999 plus tenths of hours),
