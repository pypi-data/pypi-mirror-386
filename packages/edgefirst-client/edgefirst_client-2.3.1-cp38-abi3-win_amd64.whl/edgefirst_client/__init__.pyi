    The Box2d is a representation of a single 2D bounding box annotation
    which is a pixel-based annotation for the image that is stored in
    EdgeFirst Datasets.  The bounding boxes are normalized to the image
    dimensions (float32 values between 0 and 1).  The width and height of the
    box are provided through the `width` and `height` properties while the
    position of the box can be represented in two ways: either through the
    `left` and `top` properties which represent the top-left corner of
    the box or through the `cx` and `cy` properties which represent the
    center of the box.

    Main client for interacting with EdgeFirst Studio Server.

    The EdgeFirst Client handles the connection to the EdgeFirst Studio Server
    and manages authentication, RPC calls, and data operations. It provides
    methods for managing projects, datasets, experiments, training sessions,
    and various utility functions for data processing.

    The client supports multiple authentication methods and can work with both
    SaaS and self-hosted EdgeFirst Studio instances.

    Features:
        - **Authentication**: Token-based authentication with automatic
          persistence
        - **Dataset Management**: Upload, download, and manipulate datasets
        - **Project Operations**: Create and manage projects and experiments
        - **Training & Validation**: Submit and monitor ML training jobs
        - **Data Integration**: Convert between EdgeFirst datasets and popular
          formats
        - **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for long-running
          operations

    Examples:
        Basic client setup and authentication:

        >>> # Create a new client and authenticate
        >>> client = Client()
        >>> client.login("your-email@example.com", "password")

        >>> # Or use an existing token
        >>> client = Client(token="your-token-here")

        >>> # Get organization and list projects
        >>> org = client.organization()
        >>> projects = client.projects()  # Returns all projects
        >>> filtered = client.projects("project-name")  # Filter by name

        >>> # Work with datasets
        >>> dataset = client.dataset("ds-abc123")
        >>> datasets = client.datasets()  # List all datasets

    Note:
        The client also provides various utility methods for interacting with
        datasets and converting them to and from Polars DataFrames.
