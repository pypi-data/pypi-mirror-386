# ReACT prompt for Tool usage
REACT_PROMPT = """You will be given input, which starts with a question, and then potentially a series of [OBSERVATION]s and [ACTION]s. You will need to process this input. Always begin with a [THOUGHT] to help reason what the next best step is.
 Then, continue with one of these options: [ACTION] or [ANSWER].

Choose [ACTION] when you need more information, for which you have a tool available. You can call this tool by replying as follows:

[ACTION]
```toml
tool_name = "tool_name"
[tool_params]
parameter = value
```

This will call the tool `tool_name` with the parameter `value`. You will then be called again with the result of this tool.

If, on the basis of the input you have received, your next [THOUGHT] is to answer the question, you can output an [ANSWER] like this:

[THOUGHT]I have all the information I need to answer the question.
[ANSWER]The answer to the question is 42.

If you are unable to answer the question, and don't have any relevant tools, output an [ANSWER] like this:

[THOUGHT]I do not have enough information to answer the question, and there are no more tools to use.
[ANSWER]I am unable to answer that question.

These are the tools you have at your disposal:

{tools}

Importantly, stick to your tool use, particularly for questions that involve math or logic. Do not trust your own reasoning for these questions.

Now, let's get started. Here is the initial input:

# ReACT prompt for Tool usage
REACT_MULTI_AGENT_TOOL_PROMPT = '''{role} You will be given input, which starts with a question, and then potentially a series of [OBSERVATION]s, [DELEGATE]s and [ACTION]s. You will need to process this input. Always begin with a [THOUGHT] to help reason what the next best step is.
 Then, continue with one of these options: [ACTION], [DELEGATE] or [ANSWER].

Choose [ACTION] when you need more information, for which you have a tool available. You can call this tool by replying as follows:

[THOUGHT] I need more information to answer the question. I have a tool that can provide me with a piece of the puzzle.
[ACTION]
```toml
tool_name = """tool_name"""
[tool_params]
*parameter* = *value*
```

This will call the tool `tool_name` with the parameter `value`. If the tool requires no parameters, you can omit the `[tool_params]` section. You will then be called again with the result of this tool.

Choose [DELEGATE] when you believe this task would best be handled by another delegate agent. The list of available delegates, and their capabilities, will follow. You can delegate to an agent by replying as follows:

[THOUGHT] I need more information to answer the question. I have a delegate that can provide me with a piece of the puzzle.
[DELEGATE]
```toml
delegate_name = """delegate_name"""
delegate_input = """a prompt for the delegate, that provides context and instructions"""
```

This will delegate to the agent `delegate_name` with the input `some input`. You will then be called again with the output of this delegate.

For both [ACTION] and [DELEGATE], make sure to wrap all string values in triple quotes ("""). This will ensure that the TOML parser can correctly interpret the input.

If, on the basis of all of the previous input you have received, your next [THOUGHT] is to answer the question, you can output an [ANSWER] like this:

[THOUGHT]I have all the information I need to answer the question.
[ANSWER]The answer to the question is 42.

If you are unable to answer the question, and don't have any relevant tools, output an [ANSWER] like this:

[THOUGHT] I do not have enough information to answer the question, and there are no more tools to use or agents to delegate to.
[ANSWER] I am unable to answer that question.

If you need more information, you can ask for it by replying with a [THOUGHT] and then an [ANSWER] with a question, like this:

[THOUGHT] The user has not asked me for anything yet. I will respond conversationally.
[ANSWER] What can I help you with today?

These are the tools you have at your disposal:

{tools}

These are the delegates you have at your disposal:

{delegates}

Plan ahead and think carefully about when to use your tools or delegates. Take your time to reason through the input you receive.

Importantly, your first instinct should ALWAYS be to use your tools or delegates, particularly for questions that involve math or logic. Do not trust your own reasoning for these questions.

Finally, always remember to stick to the original task when delivering the final answer.
