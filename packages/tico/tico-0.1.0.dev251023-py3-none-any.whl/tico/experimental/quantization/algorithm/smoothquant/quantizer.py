    Quantizer for applying the SmoothQuant algorithm

    Q) Why allow choosing between input and output activations?

    SmoothQuant relies on channel-wise activation statistics to balance
    weights and activations. In practice, there are two natural sources:

    - "input": captures the tensor right before a Linear layer
      (forward-pre-hook). This matches the original SmoothQuant paper
      and focuses on scaling the raw hidden state.

    - "output": captures the tensor right after a Linear layer
      (forward-hook). This can better reflect post-weight dynamics,
      especially when subsequent operations (bias, activation functions)
      dominate the dynamic range.

    Allowing both options provides flexibility: depending on model
    architecture and calibration data, one may yield lower error than
    the other. The default remains "input" for compatibility, but "output"
    can be selected to empirically reduce error or runtime overhead.
