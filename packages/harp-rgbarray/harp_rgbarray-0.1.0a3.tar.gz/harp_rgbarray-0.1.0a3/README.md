    device.info()

    # Set the device to active mode
    device.set_mode(OperationMode.ACTIVE)

    # Get the events
    try:
        while True:
            for event in device.get_events():
                # Do what you need with the event
                print(event.payload)

        print("Exiting...")
    finally:
        # Do what you need to do to clean up. Disconnect is automatically called with the "with" statement.
