# Grapheme to Phoneme models for Norwegian Bokmål

[![lang-button](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Norsk-blue)](https://github.com/Sprakbanken/g2p-nb/blob/master/LESMEG.md) [![lang-button](https://img.shields.io/badge/-English-grey)](https://github.com/Sprakbanken/g2p-nb/blob/master/README.md)

This repo contains G2P models for Norwegian bokmål[^1], which produce phonemic transcriptions for *close-to-spoken* pronunciations (such as in spontaneous conversations: `spoken`) and *close-to-written* pronunciations (such as when reading text aloud: `written`) for 5 different dialect areas:

1. East Norwegian (`e`)
2. South West Norwegian (`sw`)
3. West Norwegian (`w`)
4. Central Norwegian (Trøndersk) (`t`)
5. North Norwegian (`n`)

[^1]: Bokmål is the most widely used written standard for Norwegian. The other written standard is Nynorsk. Read more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_orthography).

## Setup

Follow installation instructions from  [Phonetisaurus](https://github.com/AdolfVonKleist/Phonetisaurus/tree/kaldi). You only need the steps  "Next grab and install OpenFst-1.7.2" and "Checkout the latest Phonetisaurus from master and compile without bindings".

## Data

The pronunciation lexica that were used to train the G2P-models are free to download and use from Språkbanken's resource catalogue: [NB Uttale](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/ressurskatalog/oai-nb-no-sbr-79/)

For more information about the lexica, see the Github repo: [Sprakbanken/nb_uttale](https://github.com/Sprakbanken/nb_uttale)

The models and data can be downloaded from [release v2.0](https://github.com/Sprakbanken/g2p-nb/releases/tag/v2.0)
or from Språkbanken's resource catalogue [G2P-no-2_0.tar.gz](https://www.nb.no/sbfil/verktoy/g2p_no/G2P-no-2_0.tar.gz).

Extract them and place the folders `data` and `models` in your local clone of this repo.

## Content

- `models/`: contains the models, as well as auxiliary files used by Phonetisaurus
  - `nb_*.fst`: model files to use with `phonetisaurus-apply`. The expansion of `*` is a string of a dialect and pronunciation style, e.g. `e_spoken` or `t_written`.
  - `nb_*.o8.arpa`: 8-gram-models for phoneme sequences that Phonetisaurus uses during training.
  - `nb_*.corpus`: aligned graphemes and phonemes from the lexica.
- `data/`: contains various lexica used for training and testing, including predictions from the models on the test set
  - `NB-uttale_*_train.dict`: training data for `models/nb_*.fst`. Each file contains 543 495 word-transcription pairs (WTP), and makes up 80% of all unique WTPs in the lexicon.
  - `NB-uttale_*_test.dict`: test data for `models/nb_*.fst`. Each file contains the remaining 20% of the WTPs in the lexicon, i.e. 135 787 WTPs.
  - `predicted_nb_*.dict`: The words from the testdata with the model's predicted transriptions.
  - `wordlist_test.txt`: The orthographic words from the test data, which the models predict transcriptions for.
- `evaluate.py`: script to evaluate the models. The method for calculating WER and PER were re-implemented.
- `g2p_stats.py`: script to evaluate the models from V1.0, which can be used to compare results between these models and the NDT models (with and without tone and stress markers) from version 1.
- `LICENSE`: The license text for CC0, which this resource is distributed with.

## Usage

```shell
phonetisaurus-apply --model models/nb_e_spoken.fst --word_list data/wordlist_test.txt  -n 1  -v  > output.txt
```

- Input data (`--word_list`) should be a list of newline-delimited words. See the file [`data/wordlist_test.txt`](./data/wordlist_test.txt) for an example.
- The trained G2P-models are `.fst` files located in the `models` folder. The same folder also contains aligned `.corpus` files and phoneme 8-gram models (`.arpa` files), also from the `Phonetisaurus` training process.
- `-n` lets you adjust the number of most probable predictons.

## Evaluation

There are 2 scripts to calculate word error rate (WER) and phoeneme error rate (PER) statistics, which give slightly different results.

### `evaluate.py`

Calculates stats for all the provided models by default.
You can give a pronunciation variant (e.g. `-l e_spoken`) to calculate stats for specific models.

- The WER score is calculated as the count of all mismatching transcriptions (1 error = 1 mismatching word) divided by the count of all words in the reference, i.e. a `*_test.dict` file.
- PER is calculated as the count of all errors (1 error = a mismatching phoneme) divided by the total count of phonemes in the reference file.

```shell
python evaluate.py
```

### `g2p_stats.py`

Calculates WER and PER for two input files.

1. The reference file (e.g. `data/NB-uttale_e_spoken_test.dict`)
2. The model prediction file (e.g. `output.txt` from the command in [Usage](#usage), or `data/predicted_nb_e_spoken.dict`).

- The WER score is calculated as the count of errors (1 error = 1 mismatching word) divided by the count of all words in the predictions, i.e. a `predicted_*.dict` file.
- PER is calculated as the sum of phone error rates for each transcription,  divided by the total count of words in the predictions.

>**NOTE**: This method doesn't take transcription lengths into account, so a transcription with 2 phonemes where 1 is wrong has a 0.5 PER while a word with length 10 with 1 error has a 0.1 PER, and the average score for the two words would be 0.35.

```shell
python g2p_stats.py data/NB-uttale_e_spoken_test.dict data/predicted_nb_e_spoken.dict
# WER: 14.049209423582523
# PER: 2.714882650391985
```

| *nb_n_spoken.fst*   | --                 | --                 |

> **NOTE**: *The t_spoken and n_spoken model predictions are not the same length as the reference file, which causes the script to exit.*

### Transcription standard

The G2P models have been trained on the NoFAbet transcription standard which is easier to read by humans than X-SAMPA. NoFAbet is in part based on [2-letter ARPAbet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET) and is made by [Nate Young](https://www.nateyoung.se/) for the National Library of Norway in connection with the development of [*NoFA*](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/en/resource-catalogue/oai-nb-no-sbr-59/), a forced aligner for Norwegian. The equivalence table below contains X-SAMPA, IPA and NoFAbet notatations.

Unstressed syllables are marked with a 0 after the vowel or syllabic consonant. The nucleus is marked with a *1* for tone 1 and a *2* for tone 2. Secondary stress is marked with *3*.
