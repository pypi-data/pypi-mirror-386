1 INTRODUCTION

Program 'dsarch' is a comprehensive utility for archiving data onto CISL
Research Data Archive (RDA) Servers; and recording detailed information about
data files, data period, file counts and sizes of a given dataset into Research
Data Archive Database (RDADB). A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) can be
assigned to a dataset to put the dataset under DOI/Version control, and all
the web data files of the dataset are linked to the new DOI/Version Control.
Archived data files for one dataset can be organized into sub-products, called
groups. Data files can be further organized into subgroups. Theoretically there
is no limit to how many levels of subgroups that can be setup. The information
of data files recorded in RDADB can be also retrieved and modified using this
utility program.

A dataset, if not in RDADB yet, can be initiated through Metadata Manager,
https://dss.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/internal/dssmm. To process data archives, 'dsarch'
can perform the following major functions:
  - Setup a dataset, and its groups/subgroups if specified,  in the RDADB to
    make it ready for data archiving
  - Add, update and terminate DOI/Version Controls for a given dataset
  - Archive data files by copying them from working area to the RDA Servers
  - Call 'gatherxml' to evaluate file content metadata for the archived files
  - Cross-archive data files by duplicating them between Object Stores and RDA
    Data Disk Servers
  - Save file information of the archived data into RDADB
  - Retrieve dataset/group/file information saved in RDADB
  - Cross-archive data files by duplicating them between Object Stores and RDA
    Data Disk Servers
  - Move data files from one dataset, or even one group, to another; or move
    data files from one location to another
  - Tar a provided file list from one or multiple datasets, and Backup it up
    onto Globus Quasar Server for a backup copy, and optionally another disaster
    backup copy
  - Retore damaged data files from the Quasar backup server
  - Remove files from RDA Servers
  - Auto-restart interrupted dsarch commands recorded in RDADB
  - Regenerate filelist and main webpages on demand after changes made to
    a dataset

A supporting utility program, 'myconvert', was developed to convert and transfer
SCCS metadata (text-based flat files) into RDADB, and another program,
'publish_filelist', was developed to publish the RDA Server filelists
of datasets to user interfaces on the RDA Web Server. These are complementary
utilities of 'dsarch'. Check usages of them for detail help information.

The RDADB dataset flag, -UD (-UseDSARCH), must be, at least, set to 'Y' for a
dataset before data files can be archived and the associated file information
can be inserted or modified into RDADB by 'dsarch'. This flag also controls
publication for file lists: 'P' or 'W' to publish file list for data files on
RDA Server. The published filelists are part of the user interface for
each dataset viewed on the RDA Web Server. Check description of Action option
-SD (-SetDataset) and Info option -UD (-UseDSARCH) for details on how to set
this flag properly.

If, after moved, a data file name, including its path, is different from its
original file name, the new file name overrides the original file name,
but the original name is also recorded in RDADB with link to the new data file
name. Both file names are considered to be the same data file when the data
accesses of this file are gathered for usage metrics. Therefore, 'dsarch' is 
recommended for moving data files, instead of direct moving commands.

Combine another untiliy program, dsquasar, to backup archived data files onto
Globus Quasar Server. The dsquasar helps to identify and create filelists of
un-backed up data files, and save them as input files for dsarch to tar and
back them up.
 
Some validation procedures are added to prevent DECS specialists from executing
'dsarch' accidentally on a wrong dataset. If an input file is used to hold
option information for processing 'dsarch' of a given dataset, the input file
name must start with the dataset number, as in format of 'dsnnn.n.*'; the
wildcard '*' matches one or multiple characters valid for file names. Another
validation is supported to check if a specialist is allowed to execute 'dsarch'
on the chosen dataset.  Action stops if a specialist is not in the authorized
list, unless a Mode option -MD (-MyDataset) is present. The option -MD tells
'dsarch' to go ahead finish an Action forcefully.

For failed data archive actions, (-AW|-AS|-AH|-AQ), due to storage system downs,
the identical dsarch actions will be retried after the systems are backed up
again. This ability will only be turned on if option -BP (-d) is present and
the dsarch actions sent into background batch processes, and the related
information is saved in RDADB and 

When a DOI/Version control is added to dataset, it can not be removed, although
it can be terminated when the dataset is not active anymore for its data are out
of date. The data filelist of the inactive dataset can still be reconstructed
per user request via the terminated DOI/Version control information. Restrictions
are applied to data files of a dataset that is under DOI/Version control. These
data files can not be moved or deleted, but new data files can be added for
operational datasets. When a data file is archived, normally it can not changed
unless new data are appended to the same data files.

When a dataset is under DOI/Version control, only the Web data files are put
under the version control directly. If there are saved data staged on disks
for internal uses or easy access to the NCAR users, it is responsibility of
the specialist who owns the dataset to maintain them.

In the following sections, general usage of 'dsarch' is described first; and
detail descriptions of Action options are given next; and then Mode and Info
options are explained in more detail on how to modify and pass information
for Action options, respectively. Examples of actions and other options are
interspersed through out the document.


2 GENERAL DSARCH USAGE

  dsarch [[-(DS|Dataset)] dsnnn.n] [Action Option] [Mode Options] [Info Options]
      or
  dsarch [-(IF|InputFile)] InputFileNames

Quotes [] indicate optional. A pipeline '|' in parentheses as in format (A|B)
means either A or B can be used. The options applied to 'dsarch' are divided
into three categories, Action, Mode, and Information (Info for short) options. 
Action options are used to specify what tasks this utility to execute, Mode
options are used to modify behaviors of the actions, and the Info options 
are used to pass information, one or multiple values, to run 'dsarch'. An option
can be given in form of either short name or long name, -DS or -Dataset for
example. Some options have alias names for convenience; -UseRDADB, for example,
is an alias option name for Mode option -UD (-UseDSARCH). Option names can be
given in either upper or lower cases, while the values following Info options
are case sensitive. 

Option -DS is actually an Info option which is used to specify a dataset number.
It is listed separately because a dataset number is a common value required for
most actions. If a dataset number is given as the first option following
'dsarch' the option name -DS (-Dataset) can be omitted.

Specify one of the Action options each time to execute 'dsarch'. Based on what
Action is chosen, some of the Info options are mandatory and others are optional
and certain Mode options can be applied to alter the behaviors of the Action.

All options, except Info option -IF (-InputFile), can be given either on command
line or in input files. Input file names are presented per Info option -IF and
can only be provided on command line. Check description of Info option -IF
(-InputFile) for detail on how to present options in input files. One or
multiple input files, combined with options on command line, are allowed to run
'dsarch'. The option name, -IF (-InputFile), itself can be omitted if a single
input file is given on command line, while the action and other option
information are all provided inside the input file.

When information of dataset, DOI/Version Controls, groups, and the
Web/Save/Help/Quasar files are retrieved from RDADB, Info options are used to
specify conditions for querying information from RDADB. Some special signs can
be used to further confine the information with special and complicated
conditions; they are '!', '<', '>' and '<>'.  These special signs, if provided
on command line,  must be quoted or escaped to avoid of being interpreted by
Unix OS system. The '!', or \!, means exclusion to the following value(s) and
it must be the first item following an Info option name, while '<' or '>' mean
greater or less than the following value, and '<>' means between the following
two values. Combine '!' and '<', as syntax "'!' '<' OptionValue", to make a
condition of 'larger than or equal to OptionValue'. 

Description of an individual option is displayed if 'dsarch' is issued on 
command line as

  dsarch [Option] -(h|help) [Option]

A description is displayed for an option given either before or after -(h|help).
If no option is specified or 'dsarch' is issued by itself, this whole document
is displayed per UNIX utility 'more'. A hard copy of this help document can be
printed from the saved file: ~rdadata/dssdb/prog_usage/dsarch.usg.

3 ACTION OPTIONS

Action options are used to specify what task 'dsarch' executes. No values
are allowed to follow Action options. Multiple tasks may be processed with a
single execution of 'dsarch' depending on what Action option is chosen. Some of
the comprehensive actions include automatically other simpler actions as
default; and others include additional actions when certain Mode options are
present. Multiple Action options provided simultaneously are blocked.

Some actions are setting information into and some getting information from
RDADB for a given dataset. A using DSARCH flag must be set to 'Y', 'I', 'P', or
'W' per Info option -UD (-UseDSARCH) before setting actions can be executed
for a dataset.

Based on the information being manipulated, the actions are divided into seven 
categories:
     Dataset Actions - create, modify and retrieve dataset information in RDADB
 DOI/Version Actions - add, modify, view and terminate DOI/Version control for
                       a given dataset
       Group Actions - create, delete, modify and retrieve group information in
                       RDADB, of a given dataset
        File Actions - archive local data files as Saved/Web/Help files; move
                       and delete archived files on RDA Server; create, delete,
                       modify and retrieve information of archived files in
                       RDADB, of a given dataset, and groups if specified
    All Info Actions - create, modify and retrieve all information, of dataset,
                       groups and files of a given dataset in RDADB 
     Webpage Actions - regenerate dataset main and filelist webpages


3.1 Dataset Actions 

  Dataset information can be modified and viewed via Actions included in this
  section:
  Set Dataset Information - modify information of an existing dataset
  Get Dataset Information - retrieve information of an existing dataset

3.1.1 Set Dataset Information
  -SD or -SetDataset, modifies dataset information into RDADB for a given
  dataset number.

         [-(BT|BeginTime) BeginAtTimes] 
         [-(ED|EndDate) EndOnDates]
         [-(ET|EndTime) EndOnTimes] 

  Mode options that can be specified for setting dataset action:
        -(MD|MyDataset) - overrides the default specialist and enables RDADB 
                          information to be set by any one
           -(NT|NoTrim) - skip trimming of spaces and comments from input
                          values to speed up reading input file(s)
      -(RT|ResetTGroup) - reset top group index for all the Saved/Web file records 
     -(WM|WithMetadata) - re-gathers Web file content metadata at dataset level
   -(WN|WithFileNumber) - reevaluates and resets file counts 

  A given dataset number is normally added via dataset Metadata Manager (MM).
  The Action -SD modifies dataset record, and the associated
  data periods for groups if any. Data periods for groups can be modified by
  'dsarch', while they can be created, removed and modified per MM. 

  The Web data accessing location flag of a dataset is provided via option
  -LC (-Location). The defualt value is 'G' for accessing web files from Glade
  Disk if there exists any web data files. A value of 'O' is set as default
  if all web data files of the dataset are on Object Store, and a value of 'C'
  is set as default if all web data files of the dataset are at CGD data path.

  For example, set dataset information of use DSARCH flag, reset file counts and
  data size, and beginning data date into RDADB for dataset number 'd744004'

  dsarch d744004 SD -WN -UD Y -BD 1999-07-01

3.1.2 Get Dataset Information
  -GD or -GetDataset, retrieves dataset information from RDADB for a given
  dataset number.

                         groups if any
  -(WN|WithFileNumber) - gathers and displays Saved/Web file counts 

  Use Info option -FN (-FieldNames) to specify what dataset fields to retrieve.
  It defaults to 'SWFULQ' if option -FN is omitted. Information of all available
  fields is retrieved if -FN ALL is given.

3.2 DOI/Version Actions 

  DOI/Version controls can be added, modified, viewed and terminated via Actions 
  included in this section:
       Set Version Control - add and modify DOI/Version control information
       Get Version Control - retrieve DOI/Version control information
 Terminate Version Control - terminate an active DVI/Version control

3.2.1 Set Version Control
  -SV or -SetVersion, adds and modifies DOI/Version controls for a given dataset number. 

  dsarch [-(DS|Dataset)] dsnnn.n [-](SV|SetVersion) [Mode Options]
         [-(VI|VersionIndex) VersionIndex]
         [-(IV|InternalVersion) InternalVersionIndex]
         [-(EV|ExternalVersion) AssignedVersionNumber]
         [-(DN|DOINumber) DOInumber]
         [-(VT|VersionStatus) VersionRecordStatus]    # P-Pending, A-Active, H-History
         [-(BD|BeginDate) VersionStartdate]
         [-(BT|BeginTime) VersionStartTime]
         [-(ED|EndDate) VersionEnddate]
         [-(ET|EndTime) VersionEndTime]
         [-(DE|Description) VersionNote]

  Mode options that can be specified for setting DOI/Version control action:
   -(MD|MyDataset) - overrides the default specialist and enables RDADB 
                     information to be set by any one
      -(NT|NoTrim) - skips trimming of spaces and comments from input
                     values to speed up reading input file(s)
  -(NV|NewVersion) - adds a new version control record into RDADB

  If a version index is given and it is in RDADB already, its record is modified.
  A new version control record is added if version control index is not given or it is
  0 and Mode option -NV (-NewVersion) is present.
  
  When a version control record is first added into RDADB without DOI number specified,
  it is in status of Pending. It can only be changed to Active if a DOI number
  is provided. An active version control record is added with a new DOI number and a
  version control index is auto-generated. 
  
  For example, put dataset d999009 under DOI/Version control
  
  dsarch d999009 SV -NV -DN DOINumber
  
  If the data of d999009 are updated mostly or completely to a newer version (set of
  files) a new DOI number is needed. You may execute the same 'dsarch' command to
  add another new active version control record with a new DOI number. The previous
  version control record is changed automatically to status of History and its DOI number
  is superseded now by the current DOI number. Only one active version control record can
  exist for a give dataset.
  
  If the data of d999009 are modified minimally a new internal version index is needed
  with the same DOI number, you may execute the same 'dsarch' command to add another
  new version control record with a new internal version index but the same existing DOI
  number. The previous version control record is also changed to status of History.

  One case of the minimal data change is to replace one or multiple erroneous Web
  files under version control. The files are first moved to different filenames
  via dsarch Action -MV. The file type is autmatically set to 'V' as Version
  controlled type. A new internal version can be optionally added at this time. Then
  new Web files are added as replacements.
 
  Usage Note: Various RDA use cases are described here. It is recommended that you review
  and know these use cases, so that the DOIs in the RDA are handled consistently.

3.2.2 Get Version Control
  -GV or -GetVersion, retrieves DOI/Version control information from RDADB for a given
  dataset number. 

  dsarch [-(DS|Dataset)] dsnnn.n [-](GV|GetVersion) [Mode Option]
         [-(FN|FieldNames) FieldNameString]
         [-(KV|KeyValue) KeyNames]     # specify key names to view their values
         [-(OF|OutputFile) OutputFileName] 
         [-(DB|Debug) DebugModeInfo]

  Mode option that can be specified for getting DOI/Version control Action:
    -(FO|FormatOutput) - format the column output with a same width for all
                         values of a given field 

  Use Info option -FN (-FieldNames) to specify what version control fields to retrieve.
  It defaults to 'VIEDSJX' if option -FN is omitted. Information of all available
  fields is retrieved if -FN ALL is given. 

  Valid version control field names and their corresponding Info options:

  Names  Info Options           Descriptions
  V      -(VI|VersionIndex)     version control index
  I      -(IV|InternalVersion)  Internal version number 
  E      -(EV|ExternalVersion)  External version number to publish
  D      -(DN|DOINumber)        DOI number created for the version control
  S      -(VT|VersionStatus)    version control status, A-Active, P-Pending and H-History
  J      -(BD|BeginDate)        date the version control starts at
  K      -(BT|BeginTime)        time the version control starts at
  X      -(ED|EndDate)          date the terminated version control ends by
  Y      -(ET|EndTime)          time the terminated version control ends by
  N      -(DE|Description)      note for the version control record

  Info option -OF (-OutputFile) is used to specify a file name to save the
  retrieved information for later usage. Result of this action is displayed
  on screen if no output file is provided.

  For example, get version control information of d132000 for all fields and dump the
  output into file 'd132000.vrsn'

  dsarch d132000 GV -FN ALL -OF d132000.vrsn

<<Content of output file d132000.vrn>>

9<:>1<:><:>10.5065/D6SQ8XDW<:>A<:>2013-03-04<:>14:38:44<:><:><:><:>


3.2.3 Terminate Version Control
  -TV or -Terminate, terminates a version control from RDADB for a specified dataset. 

  dsarch [-(DS|Dataset)] dsnnn.n [-](TV|TerminateVersion) [Mode Options]
          -(VI|VersionIndex) VersionIndix 
         [-(LN|LoginName) LoginAccountName]
         [-(DB|Debug) DebugModeInfo]

  Mode options that can be specified for terminating version control action:
  -(MD|MyDataset) - overrides the default specialist and enables RDADB 
                    information to be set by any one
     -(NT|NoTrim) - skip trimming of spaces and comments from input
                    values to speed up reading input file(s)
  
  The version control record to be terminated is identified by the version index given 
  per Info option -VI (-VersionIndex) and dataset number per option -DS. This action
  is blocked if there exist any Web data files lined to the version index. To terminate
  the version control record with Web files under it, you gather the Web file names per
  action option -GW (-GetWebFile), and either set the version index value to 0 or a
  different index, or move the Web files to Saved files; then terminate the version
  control.

  For example,  terminate version index 5 of d999009

  dsarch d999009 TV -VI 5

  After termination, an active version control record is changed to status 'H' and the
  record is retained for future references, but for a Pending version control record, it
  is completely removed from RDADB if it is terminated.
  

3.3 Group Actions

  Groups are for further dividing a dataset into multiple products. Dataset 
  group information can be created, modified, deleted and viewed via Actions
  included in this section:
     Set Group Information - create or modify group information into RDADB for
                             a specified dataset
     Get Group Information - retrieve information of existing dataset groups
  Delete Group Information - delete one or multiple dataset groups
  Change Group Information - change one or multiple group indices to different
                             values

3.3.1 Set Group Information
  -SG or -SetGroup, creates and modifies group information into RDADB for a
  given dataset number. One or multiple groups can be processed each time.

  dsarch [-(DS|Dataset)] dsnnn.n [-](SG|SetGroup) [Mode Options]

  Mode options that can be specified for setting group action:
       -(MD|MyDataset) - overrides the default specialist and enables RDADB 
                         information to be set by any one
          -(NT|NoTrim) - skip trimming of spaces and comments from input
                         values to speed up reading input file(s)
     -(RT|ResetTGroup) - reset top group index for all the Saved/Web file records
                         in a group
    -(WM|WithMetadata) - re-gathers Web file content metadata at the group level
  -(WN|WithFileNumber) - re-evaluates and resets Saved/Web file counts for the
                         affected groups

  If a group index per option -GI (-GroupIndex) exists in RDADB already for the
  specified dataset, group record is modified; otherwise, a new group record is
  added. For a new group record, a unique group index number must be provided.

  A tree structure of groups can set by using subgroups. A subgroups is created 
  if its parent group index is identified per options -PI (-ParentIndex).
  Theoretically there is no limits how many levels of subgroups can be set.
  As default, three subgroup levels are displayed on group list webpages; but it
  can be reset to any number by option -GL (-GroupLevel) per action -SD
  (-SetDataset).

  If a group type is changed from P to I, all its subgroups are set to I
  recursively, and all Saved/Web Files under the group or its subgroups are
  also set to I.
 
  For example, set multiple group information of d744004 via input file
  'd744004.grp'

  dsarch SG -IF d744004.grp

<<Content of input file d744004.grp>>
Dataset<=>d744004
EndDate<=>2005-09-30 # set end data date into table 'dataset'
GroupIndex<:>Title<:>GroupPattern<:>DescWeb<:>
1<:>Blended Wind<:>.bln<:>
The 'bln' product is the blended wind field output.<:>
2<:>NCEP Re-analyses<:>.low<:>
The 'low' fields consist of the NCEP re-analyses splined
to the 0.5 x 0.5 degree grid (i.e. no QSCAT data blended).<:>
3<:>Superposition of QSCAT Observations<:>.sub<:>
The 'sub' product is output from an intermediate step in the blending process
that consists of the superposition of QSCAT observations on NCEP before
blending. This product is of no particular scientific value, but very useful
in identifying the satellite data swaths in each composite of 12-hours of
QSCAT observations.<:>

         [-(DB|Debug) DebugModeInfo]

  Mode options that can be specified for deleting group action:
       -(MD|MyDataset) - overrides the default specialist and enables RDADB 
                         information to be set by any one
          -(NT|NoTrim) - skip trimming of spaces and comments from input
                         values to speed up reading input file(s)
     -(RT|ResetTGroup) - reset top group index for the HPSS/Web file records 
  -(WN|WithFileNumber) - reevaluates and resets HPSS/Web file counts for the
                         affected groups 

  The groups to be deleted are identified by group indices given per Info
  option -GI (-GroupIndex) and dataset number per option -DS. This action
  is blocked if there exist any subgroups or data files under the groups to
  be deleted.  To delete the groups with files under them, you gather the files
  on Saved or RDA Server per action options, -GS (-GetSavedFile) or -GW
  (-GetWebFile), and set the group indices of the files to 0 or change them to
  other group indices via action -CG (-ChangeGroup), or delete the files
  gathered per action -DL (-Delete); then delete the groups.

  For example,  delete group indices 2 and 3 of d744004

  dsarch d744004 DG -GI 2 3


3.3.4 Change Group Information
  -CG or -ChangeGroup, changes group indices from original groups given by
  option -OG (-OriginGroup) to new groups specified by option -GI (-GroupIndex)
  for a given dataset.

  -(WN|WithFileNumber) - reevaluates and resets HPSS/Web file counts for the
                         affected groups 

  A dataset group is identified by its group index. It can only be changed to
  different value via this action -CG and both original group indices per Info
  option -OG (-OriginGroup) and new group indices per Info option -GI
  (-GroupIndex) are present. The Saved and Web File namesassociated to the
  original group indices are changed to new group indices correspondingly. The
  original group indices must exist in RDADB for the given dataset.

  For example,  change group indices 1 and 2, to 2 and 3 of d744004

  dsarch d744004 CG -OG 1 2 -GI 2 3

  all the given files on RDA Server.

  Pattern matching is used for identify a group index for a given saved file
  if group index is not given explicitly and Info option -PO (-PatternOffset)
  if present. The Web file name is matched against group pattern values that
  are previously saved in group records via Action -SG (-SetGroup).

  The dataset number per option -DS (-Dataset) is mandatory unless Saved file 
  names are provided. An error message is prompted for specialist to pick one
  dataset number and rerun 'dsarch' if multiple datasets are identified for
  given Saved file information without specified dataset number. Saved file names
  are expanded automatically to include full paths relative to the dataset Saved
  Home Directories if the file names are given without or with incomplete paths.

  Saved file information can be retrieved for further specified file archive
  types per option -ST (-SavedFileType), groups per option -GI (-GroupIndex) or

  Web file names must be provided per option -WF (-WebFile) for this action to
  work, unless Info Option -ON (-OrderNames) is provided to reorder Web files
  of specified dataset and groups. The number of values passed in following
  Info options should match the number of file names given per option -WF,
  except for options related to dataset information and the Info options that
  are allowed to pass in single values, such as -GI (-GroupIndex), -AF
  (-ArchiveFormat), -DF (-DataFormat), and -WT (-WebFileType). If a single group
  index is provided for multiple Web file names, the index value is shared by
  all the given files on RDA Server.

  Pattern matching is used for identify a group index for a given Web file
  if group index is not given explicitly and Info option -PO (-PatternOffset)
  if present. The Web file name is matched against group pattern values that
  are previously saved in group records via Action -SG (-SetGroup).

  The web file status can be set to either P (public) or I (internal) for data
  type D (data), N (ncar data), O (document) and S (software). For a Web file is
  set to be under an Internal group, its status is automatically forced to I.

  If a Web file is set to be under an Internal group, its status is forced to I.

  the given dataset, and groups if specified, previously saved in RDADB. The
  original local file names, including paths, are used if Mode option -KP
  (-KeepLocalPath) is specified. Option -SP is not allowed if Mode option -KP
  is given. 

  Group information for data files to be archived are given per option -GI
  (-GroupIndex) or -GN (-GroupName). Pattern matching is used for identify a
  group index for a given Web file if group index is not given explicitly, and
  the file record not exists in RDADB yet or Info option -PO (-PatternOffset)
  if present. The Web or local file name is matched against group pattern values
  that are previously saved in group records via Action -SG (-SetGroup). If no
  group index is provided and no group pattern matching, an index value of 0
  is defaulted for a data file to indicate no group.

  The number of values passed in per Info options must be the same as the number
  of local file names provided, except for the Info options that are allowed to
  pass in single values, such as options -GI (-GroupIndex), -DF (-DataFormat),
  -AF (-ArchiveFormat), -ST (-SavedFileType), and -SP (-SavedPath). If a signle
  group index is provided for multiple given local file names, the group index
  is shared by all the given data files.

  The location flag is provided via option -LC (-Location). The defualt value
  is 'G' for archiving a saved file onto Glade Disk only.

         [-(LN|LoginName) LoginAccountName]
         [-(DB|Debug) DebugModeInfo]

  Mode options that can be specified for deleting file action:
     -(DX|DeleteXML) - if present, calling 'dcm' to delete file content metadata
                       of the Web files to be deleted 
   -(EM|EMailNotice) - sends email for summary and errors for this action
     -(MD|MyDataset) - overrides the default specialist and enables RDADB 
                       information to be set by any one
       -(NE|NoEmail) - does not send email to the specialist for failed action
        -(NT|NoTrim) - skip trimming of spaces and comments from input values to
                       speed up reading input file(s)
     -(RD|RemoveDir) - removes empty saved or web directories

  Use this action to delete data files on RDA Server. The Saved, Web, Help or Quasar
  File names are provided per option -SF (-SavedFile), -WF (-WebFile), -HF (-HelpFile),
  or -QF (-Quasarfile), respectively. 
  
  Specify the number of levels of directories via Info option -DD (-DeleteDir) 
  for the directories to be deleted if Saved or Web files inside them are all
  deleted.


3.5 All Info Actions 

  Information of dataset, groups and data files on RDA Servers can be
  created, modified and viewed together via actions included in this section:
  Get All Information - retrieve information of dataset, groups, and files on
                        RDA Server together for a specified dataset
  Set All Information - modify information of existing dataset, groups and data
                        files on RDA Server of a given dataset, and create
                        new records for groups and data files if they are
                        not recorded in RDADB yet

3.5.1 Get All Information 
  -GA or -GetALL, retrieves dataset, group and Saved/Web/Help/Quasar file
  information for a given dataset. This is a comprehensive action, combining all Get
  Actions, -GD (-GetDataset), -GG (-GetGroup), -GS (-GetSavedFile), -GW (-GetWebFile),
  -GH (-GetHelpFile), and -GQ (-GetQuasarFile.

  dsarch [-(DS|dataset)] dsnnn.n -(GA|GetAll)
         [-(OF|OutputFile|>) OutputFileName] 
         [-(DB|Debug) DebugModeInfo]

  No Mode option is applied to this action. Information of all available fields
  is retrieved for dataset, groups and files.

  Section headers are generated as [DATASET] for dataset, [DSGROUP] for
  groups, [SAVEDFILE] for Saved file information, [WEBFILE] for Web file information,
  [HELPFILE] for Help file information, and [QUASARFILE] for Quasar file information.

  Info option -OF (-OutputFile|>) is normally used to specify a file name to
  save the retrieved information for later usage. Result of this action is
  displayed on screen if no output file is provided. The output file can be
  edited and treated as a input file to save the changes back to RDADB per
  action -SA (-SetAll).

3.5.2 Set All Information 
  -SA or -SetAll, creates and modifies dataset, group and Saved/Web/Help/Quasar
  file information into RDADB for a given dataset number. This is a comprehensive
  action, combining all four Set Actions, -SD (-SetDataset), -SG (-SetGroup), -SS
  (-SetSavedFile), -SW (-SetWebFile), -SH (-SetHelpFile), and -SQ (-SetQuasarFile).

  dsarch  -(SA|SetAll) [Mode Options]
         [-(LN|LoginName) LoginAccountName]
          -(IF|InputFile) Input Files 
         [-(DB|Debug) DebugModeInfo]

  ALL Mode options that can be applied to the Set Actions, -SD, -SG, -SW, -SH
  and -SQ can be specified for this action. At least one input file is need to
  execute this action since section headers need to be specified in an input file.
  One way of creating an input file is to get one per action -GA (-GetALL) for a
  dataset. The output file can then be edited and used as an input file to set
  all information of the dataset back to RDADB.


3.6 Webpage Actions

  Information changed for dataset/groups/files of a given dataset can be
  refreshed onto the main and filelist web pages of a given dataset via actions
  included in this section:  
  Regenerate Dataset Webpages - regenerate main webpage and try to republish
                                all the filelists of data on HPSS and RDA Server
    Increment Of Cache Number - increase the cache control number by 1 for
                                a specified dataset; therefore, the cached
                                filelists are refreshed accordingly

3.6.1 Regenerate Dataset Webpages
  -UW or -UpdateWeb, regenerates main and filelist webpages to catch the
  changes of dataset/group/file information in RDADB of a given dataset.

  dsarch [-(DS|Dataset)] dsnnn.n -(UW|UpdateWeb)
         [-(DB|Debug) DebugModeInfo]

  Given a dataset number to refresh its the main and filelist web pages.

  A cache control number of each dataset is increased by 1 each time the
  changes of dataset/group/file information of the dataset are set into RDADB
  by 'dsarch'. The new cache number tells webpage utility to refresh the
  cached group and file information of the dataset. Changes made through other
  utilities may not modify this cache control number. Specialists can always
  manually increase this cache number by action -UC (-UpdateCache).

3.6.2 Increment Of Cache Number
  -UC or -UpdateCache, (alias: -UpdateCacheNumber), increases the cache control number
  by 1 for a given dataset.
   
  dsarch [-(DS|Dataset)] dsnnn.n -(UC|UpdateCache)
         [-(DB|Debug) DebugModeInfo]

 
4 MODE OPTIONS

Use proper Mode options to modify behaviors of Action options. Mode options
are all optional. No value is allowed to be passed in following any Mode option.

  -BG or -BackGround (Alias: -b), background process. When it presents
  screen display is turned off for both standard outputs and errors.

  -CL or -CleanLocal (Alias: -CleanLocfile|-CleanLocalFile), when present for
  archiving actions -AS, or -AW, cleans the local files after they are all archived
  successfully. If local files are staged temporarily in sub-directories, the
  sub-directories can be removed too after all the local files are cleaned inside
  them. Add Info option -DD DirectoryLevel to tell how many level of the local
  empty directories to be removed.

  -DX or -DeleteXML, if present, calls 'dcm' to delete file content metadata
  of given Web files for actions -SW (-SetWebFile). This is the default Mode for
  action -DL (-Delete) of Web files provided via -WF (-WebFile).

  -EM or -EMailNotice, sends an email notice to the specialist who executes the
  dsarch for certain actions after a action is finished successfully or aborts
  abnormally. The Actions working with this Mode option include -AS, -AW,, -AH,
  -AQ, -SS, -SW, -SH, -SQ, -RQ, -MV and -DL. An email notice includes errors
  happening during the action and a brief summary to show the action progress.
  This option is ignored if option -d is present.

  Specialists need to be cautious of adding this Mode option to run dsarch.
  If you run dsarch to archive many files with one at a time, you will receive
  one email for each file. To make it work better, you include all the files
  you want to process into a single input file and run dsarch with option -EM
  against the input file. This way you receive a single email notice instead.
 
  -FO or -FormatOutput, if present, formats column output results for get
  actions.  A same width, evaluated dynamically, is applied for all values of a
  given field.

  -GF or -GrowingFile, if present, Action -AW (-ArchiveWebFile) will allow
  existing Web files being overridden although the data files are
  under DOI/Version control already. Normally an archived data file can not
  changed if it is linked to a version control record. This Mode option
  indicates that the data file is a growing one and needs to be updated.
  If Action -AW of 'dsarch' is controlled by configuration of 'dsupdt', a
  growing file is automatically detected and this Mode option is added to the
  'dsarch' command as needed.

  -GX or -GatherXML (Alias: -Grid2XML), if present, calls 'gatherxml' to 
  evaluate file content metadata of archived Web files. This is the default
  Mode for action -MV (-MoveFile) for Web files, to call 'rcm' to move the
  file content metadata too.
  
  -GZ or -GMTZone (Alias: -GMT|GreenwichZone|UTC), uses GMT dates/times as 
  controlling times for archiving actions, instead of mountain time.

  -KM or -KeepMetadata (Alias: -KeepMeta), for actions -MV (-MoveFile) with
  option -TS (-ToSaved) to keep the metadata record for later use after
  the web file is moved to savefile.

  -KP or -KeepPath (Alias: -KeepLocalPath), for actions -AS (-ArchiveSavedFile), -AW
  (-ArchiveWebFile) and -AH (-ArchiveHelpFile) to archive Saved/Web/Help files with
  the same file names as the local ones specified by -LF (-LocalFile).  A relative
  path is reta8ined if it is part of a local file name. Options -SP (-SavedPath)
  and -WP (-WebPath) are ignored if -KP is given. This Mode option is ignored if
  Save/Web/Help file names are specified per options -SF (-SavedFile), -WF (-WebFile),
  and -HF (-HelpFile), respectively.
  
  -MD or -MyDataset, allows a specialist to update dataset/group/file

  -NE or -NoEmail, does not send email notice to the specialist for failed action.

  -NT or -NoTrim, skips trimming of spaces and comments from input values to
  speed up reading input file(s).

  -NV or -NewVersion, adds a new version control record for a specified dataset
  if this Mode option is present for Action -SV (-SetVersion).

  -OE or -OverrideExist, if present, overrides an existing file.

  -PE or -ShowPeriod, shows period information for dataset, and groups if provided,
  for action -SD (-SetDataset).

  -RA or -RetryArchive, deprecated, does not do anything.

  -RD or -RemoveDir (Alias: -RemoveDirectory|-RemoveEmptyDir), it works with
  Actions -DL, -SS and -SW to remove empty directories for a specified dataset,
  and groups if specified.

  If empty directories are not cleaned after deleting files. Use Actions -SS or
  -SW with this Mode option, without Saved or Web file names specified, to clean
  the empty Web or HPSS directories, respectively for a given dataset, and
  groups if specified.

  -RG or -RecursiveGroup (Alias: -RepeatGroup), when present, gathers subgroups
  and file information in subgroups recursively for actions -GG (-GetGroup) and
  -GS/GW (-GetSavedFile/GetWebfile), respectively. Group index must be provided
  explicitly via Info option -GI (-GroupIndex) for this Mode option to work.

  -RN or -RelativeName, for action -GS (-GetSavedFile) and -GW (-GetWebFile) to
  show a file name with path relative to the Saved and Web paths set for
  the dataset or group, respectively.

  -RO or -ResetOrder (Alias: -Reorder), when present, resets the display orders
  of the given Saved/Web/Help/Quasar file lists as the orders the data files are
  given for actions -SS (-SetSavedFile), -SW (-SetWebFile), -SH (-SetHelpFile),
  and -SQ (-SetQuasarFile), respectively. Another way of reordering the data files
  is to provide explicitly order index values per Info option -DO (-DisplayOrder).

  Specify what fields to order on per option -ON (-OrderNames) to order the
  files accord for the whole datasets or individual groups.  Check option -ON
  for examples of ordering Files.

  -RS or -GXRSOptions, works with Mode option -GX (-GatherXML) to pass option
  R and S to command gatherxml for speeding up.

  -RT or -ResetTIndex (Alias: -ResetTopGroup), for setting actions to reset
  the top group index for Saved or Web files for dataset, and groups if
  specified.

  -SC or -SetChecksum, if presents, evaluates the md5 checksum values for data
  files on RDA Servers and saves them into RDADB

  -TO or -TarOnly, works with Action -AQ (-ArchiveQuasarFile) to tar the given
  Saved and/or Web files only, without physically backing up the Quasar file
  onto the Globus Quasar Server.

  -TS or -ToSaved (Alias: -ToSavedFile|-MoveToSaved), when present for Action -MV to
  move Web files to Saved files.

  -TT or -TotalSummary, when present, gets the statistic summary information
  for Action options -GS (-GetSavedFile) and -GW (-GetWebFile).

  -TW or -ToWeb (Alias: -ToWebFile|-MoveToWeb), when present for Action -MV to
  move Saved files to Web files.

  -UZ or -UpzipData (Alias: -Unzip|-UncompressData), uncompresses online data
  with one of the uncompressing utilities, 'gunzip', 'uncompress', 'unzip'
  or 'bunzip', according to the file name extensions of ".gz', '.Z', '.zip'
  or '.bz2', respectively

  -WC or -WithChecksum, when present, checks the MD5 checksums in addition to
  the data file sizes for online data files on RDA Server.

  -WM or -WithMetadata, for setting actions to reset the dataset/group level
  content metadata for action -SD/SG (-SetDataset/SetGroup).

  -WN or -WithFileNumber, for setting actions to reevaluate and reset the
  Saved or Web file counts for dataset, and groups if specified. These file
  counts can also be viewed for action -GD (-GetDataset) if this Mode option is
  preset. 

  -XC or -CrossCopy, works with action -AW/-AS to cross copy data files between
  Web/Saved files on Glade disk and Object files on Object store.

  -XM or -CrossMove, works with action -AW/-AS to cross move data files between
  Web/Saved files on Glade disk and Object files on Object store. This Mode option
  is different from -XC that the original files are removed.

  -ZD or -ZipData (Alias: -Zip|-CompressData), when present, Actions -AS
  (-ArchiveSavedFile) and -AW (-ArchiveWebFile) compress online data with one
  of the compressing utilities,  'gzip', 'compress', 'zip' and 'bzip', according
  to the archiving format 'GZ', 'Z', 'ZIP' or 'BZ2' provided per option -AF
  (-ARchiveFormat), respectively. If the original data files are compressed already,
  this Mode option is ignored if the same compression, and the files are uncompressed,
  before compressing, with one of the uncompressing utilities, 'gunzip', 'uncompress',
  'unzip' or 'bunzip', according to the file name extensions of ".gz', '.Z', '.zip'
  or '.bz2', respectively.


5 INFORMATION OPTIONS

Information options are used to pass information, one or multiple values, into
'dsarch'. Two types of Info options are used:
  Single-Value Info Options - pass a single value to 'dsarch'
   Multi-Value Info Options - pass one or multiple values to 'dsarch'

5.1 Single-Value Info Options

  A single-value Info option is used to pass one value into this application.
  One value, and one only, must follow a single-value option; otherwise an
  error message is displayed if no value or more than one value passed in.

  -AL or -AsyncLimit (Alias: -AsynchronousLimit), provides a value of the
  maximum number of background processes for 'cp' and 'gatherxml' calls. This
  option is ignored for PBS batch jobs.

  -AO or -ActionOption (Alias: -ActOption), provides an ending sign to idicate
  the leading option is a Action or Mode option. It is defaults to '<!>'.

  -BL or -ButtonLimit, controlling limit of available file count in filelist
  to show click buttons for download scripts. The default number is 2.

  -DD or -DeleteDir (Alias: -DeleteDirLevel|-DeleteEmptyDir), it works with
  Actions -DL (-Delete) or -MV (-MoveFile) for removing how many level of
  empty directories after all files inside are deleted or moved. It works
  with Mode option -CL too for Actions -AS and -AW to remove empty local
  directories after the local files inside of them are all cleaned.

  -DS or -Dataset, for a dataset number, or called dataset ID in form as
  [a-z]NNNNNN. It is mandatory for most actions.

  -DV or -Divider (Alias: -Delimiter, -Separator),  delimiter for separating
  columns of multi-value Info options in input files. It is default to '<:>'.

  -ES or -EqualSign, for an equal sign of assigning one value to either a
  single-value option or multi-value option in input files. It is defaulted
  to '<=>'.

  -FL or -FileLimit (Alias: -FilecountLimit), sets limit for how many files
  can be displayed on a single web page of static filelists. Files from
  multiple groups may be displayed on a single page if the total file count
  is lower than this limit, while files from a single group may be split into
  sub-filelists if the file count is beyond this limit. It defaults to 2000
  and specialists can reset it to a different value for a specified dataset
  via Action -SD (-SetDataset).

  -FN or -FieldNames, for a string of single letter field names. Values of
  the selected fields are retrieved per actions -GD (-GetDataset),
  -GG (-GetGroup), -GS (-GetSavedFile), -GW (-GetWebFile), -GH (-GetHelpFile),
  and -GQ (-GetQuasarFile). Values of default fields are retrieved according
  to what GET action is specified. Valid field names are listed in corresponding
  Get action sections.

  -LD or -LocalDirectory, provides a single local directory, file names under
  the directory, and the sub-directories recursively if any, are all collected
  as local files

  -LL or -LocalFileList, provides a single file name and the file holds a list of
  file names, one file name on each line. These file names are used as the local
  file names

  -LN or -LoginName, login name of the current user; it defaults to the current
  login DECS specialist who starts execution of 'dsarch'. Set this option if you
  try to run this utility for a specialist other than yourself. Normally this
  is set when this application is started by a daemon or as a cron job. Be
  careful of using this option since it might override the currently information
  of dataset/groups/files saved by other specialists in RDADB.

  -OF or -OutputFile, leading an output file name into which the output result
  of this application is dumped. Output file format is similar to the format of
  the input files. If this option is not given, the result is displayed on
  screen.
 
  -ON or -OrderNames, for a string of single letter field names use to order
  the results of GET actions, -GG (-GetGroup), -GS (-GetSavedFile), -GW
  (-GetWebFile), -GH (-GetHelpFile), and -GQ (-GetQuasarFile). Upper case is
  for Ascending order while lower case is for Descending order. This option also
  force reordering of files in individual groups if any file information is modified
  per Action options -AS (-ArchiveSavedFile), -AW (-ARchiveWebFile), -SS
  (-SetSavedFile), -SW (-SetWebFile), -DL (-DeleteFile) and -MV (MoveFile).

  Web filelists of specified dataset and groups can also be accomplished per
  Action -SW (-SetWebFile) with presenting option -ON, as

  dsarch dsnnn.n -SW -ON OrderNameString [-GI GroupIndices]
  
  Without specified group indices, all the files within or without groups
  will all be reordered.

  -PO or -PatternOffset, given for string offset of pattern matches while
  assigning group indices to given Saved or Web files by matches the file
  names to given group wildcard patterns for file set/archive actions.
  This is a mandatory Info option for matching group indices of files recorded
  in RDADB already. A binary search is used for pattern matching if an value of
  >= 0 is provided; while a simple linear search is used if a value of -1 is
  provided. Value of -1 is defaulted if this option is not provided for matching
  group index for a file that is not recorded in RDADB yet.

  -QS or -QsubOptions, (Alias: -PBSOptions), specifies options to execute dsarch
  as a batch job via qsub on PBS nodes. The qsub options must be quoted when prsented
  on command line, such as, -QS '-l walltime=12:00:00'.
  
  -AO or -ActOption,  for setting Action and Mode options in input files. It is
  default to '<!>'.

  -UD or -UseDSARCH (Alias: -UseRDADB), for flag of using DSARCH to control the
  given dataset. A value out of 'N', 'Y', 'I', 'P', or 'W' is saved in RDADB
  for a given dataset per action -SD (-SetDataset). A value other than 'N', at
  least 'Y', must be set for a dataset before it can manipulated by 'dsarch'.
  'Y' means the the dataset is ready to be modified by 'dsarch'.  'I', 'P',
  and 'W' mean that the dataset/group/file information of the specified dataset
  is ready to be published to web server for internal only, publicly, and Web
  file list only, correspondingly.

  -VS or -ValidSize, a minimal size for a file to be valid for archiving process.
  It defaults to 100 bytes and can be reset on command line with the update actions.

  -WI or -WaitInterval, it works for the background processes. When the number of
  background processes reaches the process limit, this option value tells 'dsarch'
  to wait this period of time before checking if any background process is finish,
  so that a new background process can be started for next waiting one.
  
  It can be provided to set a different wait interval, such as Second, Minute,
  Hour or Day. For example, '-WI 5M' is for 5 minutes. A digital value only
  assumes a unit of Second, and '-WI 300' means 300S, for example. 


5.2 Multi-Value Info Options

  A multi-value Info option is used to pass multiple values for one Info option
  into 'dsarch'. At lease one value must follow each multi-value option.

  -AF or -ArchiveFormat (Alias: -FF|-FileFormat|-ExternalFormat), for file
  archiving formats of data files being archived onto RDA Servers. The file
  archive format indicates post process of a data file. Option values, 'BI' -
  binary blocked, 'C1' or 'CH' - ASCII/character blocked, can be passed
  in for COS block information of data files; 'TAR' means a tarred file, 'Z'
  means a compressed file and 'GZ' means a gzipped file, and 'BZ2' means a file
  is compressed via bzip2. 'C1.TAR.GZ', for example, means a file is COS ASCII
  blocked and then tarred and then gzipped; the order is important. The maximum
  length of format string is 10. Additional characters are truncated for length
  longer than 10. 

  -BD or -BeginDate, for begin date of data files of a given group or the whole
  dataset, or begin date of a version control record.

  -BF or -BackupFlag, flags set in Datasets and/or groups to control Quasar
  auto-backup activities; N-No auto-backup (default value for Datasets),
  B-auto-Backup onto Quasar backup endpoint, D-auto-Backup onto Quasar backup&drdata
  endpoints, P-the same Backup flags set in parent groups (default values in groups,
  and parent group index 0 means to follow flags in datasets).

  -BP or -BatchProcess (Alias: -d, -DelayedMode), delayed mode execution. When
  it presents, the 'dsarch' command is not executed right way, but the command
  information is recorded into RDADB instead and the command is executed later
  by the centralized daemon 'dscheck'. One or multiple host names can be specified
  after option -BP to force the 'dsarch' command be executed on or not on the hosts.
  For examples, '-d rda-data' to run on host 'rda-data'; '-d rda-data:rda-web-prod'
  to run on hosts 'rda-data' and 'rda-web-prod'; and '-d \!rda-web-prod:rda-data'
  to run on all configured hosts other than 'rda-web-prod' and 'rda-data'. Character
  '!' needs to be escaped for passing in on command line. A upper limit for number
  of tries can also be passed in with this options, 1 to 99, as '-d 5' for example.
  It default to 2 for command of 'dsarch' if not specified. And also dsarch actions,
  -(AS|AW|AH|AQ), will be restarted automatically when this option is present, if
  the previous processes are failed due to storage system downs. 

  -BS or -BackupStatus, Quasar Backup File status, a single letter status flag,
  A - files are backed up onto Globus Quasar servers; T - the backup tar files
  are generated, waiting to be archived; and N - backup file records and input
  files for Web/Saved file lists are created, waiting to be tarred. 
 
  -BT or -BeginTime, for begin time of data files of a given group or the whole
  dataset, or begin time of a version control record.

  -DA or -AcessFlag, (Alias: -DataAccessFlag, -FileListFlag). flags to show web file
  lists at Dataset and/or top group levels; B-Both Filelists,
  C-Complete File List (default value), F-Faceted Browse or N-No File List.

  -DB or -Debug, to turn on debug mode with specified information. This option
  provides up to 3 values, they are Debug Level, debug log file path and debug
  log file name. The debug level is mandatory for this option. It can be a
  single integer value, for example, 1000 means to log debug messages for debug
  levels 1 to 1000; or a range of values, for example, 200-1000 means to log
  debug messages from debug levels 200 to 1000. The default debug file path is
  '$DECSHOME}/dssdb/log' and the default debug file name is 'mydss.dbg'. Provides
  the second and third values for this option to override the default ones
  respectively.

  -DE or -Description (Alias: -Desc|-Note|-FileDesc|-FileDescription), for file
  descriptions of data files. Multiple lines are allowed for a description if it is
  passed in from an input file specified by Info option -IF (-InputFile). On
  commandline, a single line description with spaces between words must be quoted
  in 'single quotes'. It presents a version control note if it is used with
  version control Actions.

  -DF or -DataFormat (Alias: -TF|-ContentFormat|-InternalFormat), data content
  format of files being archived onto RDA Servers. This is content format of data
  files. For examples, NetCDF, IMMA and etc.
  
  A default data format can be set for a given dataset. It is used for archive
  actions when the data format is not provided explicitly. 

  -DN or -DOINumber (Alias: -DOI|-DOIName), for DOI, a Digital Object
  Identification, of a given dataset for public users to reference against.

  -DO or -DisplayOrder, for display order indices of files of a given group,
  or of the whole dataset if no groups are set for the dataset. This Info option
  is ignored if Mode option -RO (-Reorder) is present.

  -ED or -EndDate, for end date of data files of a given group or the whole
  dataset, or end date of a version control record when it is terminated.

  -ET or -EndTime, for end time of data files of a given group or the whole
  dataset, or end time of a version control record when it is terminated.

  -EV or -ExternalVerion, external version number. It is only used if a public
  version number is used for a dataset; otherwise it is defaulted to empty.

  -FD or -FileDate, for date of a data file last modified on. 

  -FF or -FileFlag, File type flag, F for File and P for Path.

  -FS or -FileStatus, File status, a single letter status flag, P - show file
  to public users; and I - to show file to specialist only.
 
  -FT or -FileTime, for time of a data file last modified at.

  -GI or -GroupIndex, for group indices. This is considered only if a dataset
  is divided further into groups. To make the grouping works, run this
  utility program with action -SG (-SetGroup) for a given dataset before
  archiving files to the dataset. Valid group index values are 1, 2, 3, ....,
  while 0 means no group which is the default index value.

  If this option is omitted for file archiving options -AS or -AW of a dataset
  with groups, pattern matching logic is automatically processed; a group index
  is determined by matching the local file name to group patterns previously
  saved in RDADB. 

  -GL or -GroupLevel, number of group/subgroup levels to be displayed in the
  group lists. It defaults to 2. Set it to -2 to display one level initially
  but the group list can be expanded up to 2 levels if the subgroups exist.

  -GN or -GroupName (Alias: -GroupID), a short string, up to 20 characters, for
  group ID name. Group names can be set into RDADB for a given dataset per
  action -SG (-SetGroup). If set, they can be provided per this option to
  identify group indices, and in addition, they are displayed on webpages of
  Web filelists instead of group indices.
  
  -GP or -GroupPattern, group patterns to match local file names with group
  indices while archiving Saved or Web files. The group patterns from this
  option are saved into RDADB for specified groups of a given dataset per
  action -SG (-SetGroup).

  -GT or -GroupType (Alias: -GroupDataType), set P for Public or I for
  Internal group types. When a group type is set from P to I, all the public
  subgroups under it are set to I recursively, and all the public Web files
  under the groups or its subgroups are set to Internal too.

  -HF or -HelpFile, for Help file names. During Document or software archiving
  per action -AH (-ArchiveHelpFile), the local file names given by option -LF
  (-LocalFile) are used as default for the Help file names unless different
  file names are specified by this option.

  -HT or -HelpFileType (Alias: -HelpType), Help file types,
  a single letter property flag, D-Document and S-Software. If only one type
  is passed in, all Help files are assumed to be the same type.

  -ID or -InitialDate, for date of a Help, Document/Software, file last
  Published/Released on. 

  -IF or -InputFile, for input file names; one or multiple file names may be
  given on command line. A input file name must start with dataset number as
  in format of 'dsnnn.n.*' and the dataset number must match the dataset number
  given per option -DS (-Dataset). This restriction is for prevention that
  specialists archive data files accidentally into a wrong dataset. Input files
  are used to hold all valid options and the associated values of Info options
  that need to be passed in for execution of 'dsarch'.

  In a input file, lines start with sign '#' are considered as comments;
  Option Names can be given either short, long or alias names. Action and Mode
  options are given in format of OptionName<!>. Single value Assignment is 
  given in format of OptionName<=>OptionValue. One option is given on each line.
  Different setting sign of Action and Mode options can be provided by Info
  option -AO (-ActOption, default to <!>); and different equal sign of single
  value assignment can be provided by Info option -ES, (-EqualSign, default to
  '<=>'). Multi-value assignments can be given in columns delimited with
  separator specified per option -SP (-Separator, default to '<:>'). It starts
  with a column title line for multi-value option names and the rest holds
  values corresponding to each column titles. The value information stops at
  the end of the file or when a new column name line or another single value
  assignment appears. If the last column is a multi-line value field, an
  additional separator must be appended for each line, including the column
  title line to end lines properly.

  -IV or -InternVerion, internal version index. It is used to indicate a different
  version of data with minimal changes under the same DOI number. It is defaulted
  to 1 for a version control record with new created DOI number.

  -KV or -KeyVakue, to set specialist defined key/value pairs via action -SD
  (-SetDataset). These special key/value pairs can be viewed per option -GD
  (-GetDataset). Specialists can record key/value pair information for 
  specified datasets for personal or shared information. A key can be up to
  40 characters and a value can be up to 128 characters.

  For example, syntax to set a key/value pair of 'test/test it' for d540000 on
  command line

  dsarch d540000 SD -KV 'test=>test it' 

  and to view this pair

  dsarch d540000 GD -KV test  

  and to view all available key/value pairs

  dsarch d540000 GD -KV all 

  -LC or -Location (Alias: -LocationFlag), Storage localtion flags for CGD data,
  Web and Saved data files, and Help files, are C-CGD data, G-Glade Disk, O-Object

  location. The valid values are G or O, which mean to access online file on Glade
  or Object Store, respectively. 

  -LF or -LocalFile (Alias: -LocFile|-SourceFile), for local file names,
  also called  original or source file names. A local file is a data file that
  is ready to be archived as Saved, Web or Help file. It is later archived
  onto RDA servers according to actions -AS (-ArchiveSavedFile), -AW
  (-ArchiveWebFile) or -AH (-ArchiveHelpFile). UNIX wildcard is acceptable if
  given on command line to match multiple local file names.  Absolute or
  relative paths need to be added to the local file names if the data files are
  not located in the directory where this application is running.

  -MC or -MD5Checksum, providing md5 checksum IDs of of the given data files
  on RDA Servers.

  -ML or -MetaLink (Alias: -MetadataLink), providing a link to dataset, group or
  file level content metadata page. This link is normally auto-generated from
  inside of utility program 'gatherxml', which is triggered when Mode option
  -GX is present for actions of archiving or setting Web data files.

  Although it is not recommended, specialists are allowed, under certain
  circumstances, to generate their own detail content meta data and put a link
  via this option, and it overrides the auto-generated link.

  -ND or -NoteDocument (Alias: -DocumentNote|-DescDocument), for Document
  descriptions of a given dataset.

  -NI or -NoteInternal (Alias: -InternalNote|-DescInternal|-DI), for internal

  of Web data on RDA Server of a given group or the dataset itself.

  -OB or -OrderBy (Alias: -OrderByPattern), temporal patterns used to order
  filelist according to the string values of field names specified per
  option -ON (-OrderNames). 'YYYYmon', for example, means the order should
  be based on on 4 digit year and three letter lowercase month names as 'jan',
  'feb', and etc. Check option -ON (-OrderNames) for example of ordering
  files by temporal patterns.

  -OD or -OriginDataset, for an original dataset number; used for action
  -MV (-MoveFile).

  -OG or -OriginGroup, for original group indices, used for action -CG 
  (-ChangeGroup) to change group indices of specified data files of a
  given dataset. Check option -GI (-GroupIndex) for more information.

  -OT or -OriginType, original web file types. This option is used only
  for action -MV (-MoveFile) to move files by changing file types.

  -PI or -ParentIndex (Alias: -ParentGroupIndex), for parent group indices.
  This is considered only if a group is divided further into subgroups. 
  Subgrouping can continue going down to as many levels as needed.

  -QF or -QuasarFile, for Quasar backup file names. During Quasar backing up
  per action -AQ (-ArchiveQuasarFile), a quasar file name must be specified
  by this option.

  -QT or -QuasarFileType (Alias: -QuasarType|-BackupType), Quasar file
  types, a single letter property flag, B-Quasar Backup only and D-Quasar
  Backup and Drdata.
  
  -RF or -OriginFile, for original Web file names used for action -MV 
  (-MoveFile) to move data files from one dataset specified by option -OD
  (-OriginDataset) to a new dataset specified by option -DS (-Dataset).
  Set this option only when original file names are different from the new
  ones.

  -SF or -SavedFile, for Saved file names. During Saved data archiving
  per action -AS (-ArchiveSavedFile), the local file names given by option -LF
  (-LocalFile) are used as default for the saved file names unless different
  file names are specified by this option.

  -SP or -SavedPath, for saved file paths relative to the saved data home directory.
  For action -AS (-ArchiveSavedFile), if this option is not specified, the path
  values previously saved in RDADB for given dataset, and groups if specified,
  are used. For action -SG (-SetGroup) and -SD -(-SetDataset), path values given by
  this option are saved into RDADB for the specified groups and dataset.
  
  The group saved paths matching well with groups are important for NCAR internal
  users to list group/file information on the the data storage disks directly via
  utility program 'rdals'. One and only one single directory must be assign to a
  top level group, one additional directory should be appended for each sub-group
  down. A web path relative to the web data home directory is saved in each group
  record. In this way, the web path values match exactly the physical directory
  tree of a specified dataset.
   
  -SR or -Source, for source of a Help file contributed from.

  -ST or -SavedFileType (Alias: -SavedType|-SavedArchiveType), Saved file types,

  -TG or -TopGroupIndex (Alias: -TopGroup), top group index values for Saved/Web
  files belong to the top group or its subgroups.

  -TI or -Title, for dataset or group titles. Dataset title is readonly for
  'dsarch'; use Metadata Editor to modify it.

  -VI or -VersionIndex, version control index to have DOI/Version control on
  a given dataset.

  -VT or -VersionStatus, version control status, A-Active, P-Pending and H-History.

  -WF or -WebFile, for file names on RDA Servers. During Web data archiving
  per action -AW (-ArchiveWebFile), the local file names given by option -LF
  (-LocalFile) are used as default for the Web file names unless different
  file names are specified by this option.

  -WH or -WebHome, (Alias: -WebDataHome), for web Web data home directory
  other than the default location. Use -SD -(-SetDataset), to set web data
  home directory into RDADB for the specified dataset.
  
  -WP or -WebPath, for web file paths relative to the Web data home directory. For
  action -AW (-ArchiveWebFile), if this option is not specified, the path
  values previously saved in RDADB for given dataset, and groups if specified,
  are used. For action -SG (-SetGroup) and -SD -(-SetDataset), path values given by
  this option are saved into RDADB for the specified groups and dataset.
  
  The group web paths matching well with groups are important for NCAR internal
  users to list group/file information on the the data storage disks directly via
  utility program 'rdals'. One and only one single directory must be assign to a
  top level group, one additional directory should be appended for each sub-group
  down. A web path relative to the web data home directory is saved in each group
  record. In this way, the web path values match exactly the physical directory
  tree of a specified dataset.

  -WT or -WebFileType (Alias: -WebType|-WebArchiveType), web file types,
  D-Data and N-NCAR Data. If only one type is passed in, all Saved files are
  assumed to be the same type.

  -WU or -WebURL (Alias: -URL|-WebAddress), Web URL for a Help file to link it to
  a remote web server, such as github.com. This option works with Action -SH
  (-SetHelpFile) to create a remote Document or Software file record in RDADB
