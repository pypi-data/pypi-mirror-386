class SoftDeleteModel(SoftDeleteTable):
    """
    Abstract base model that combines Soft Delete behavior with domain-level
    serialization capabilities.

    This class should be inherited by any Django model that belongs to a domain
    layer based on the `duck_domain` library. It provides:
      - Native Soft Delete support, inherited from `SoftDeleteTable`;
      - A default UUID primary key field (`id`);
      - An abstract method `as_dto()` that enforces conversion of ORM entities
        into domain Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).

    Attributes
    ----------
    id : UUIDField
        Unique identifier for the record. Automatically generated using `uuid4`
        and set as the primary key.

    Methods
    -------
    as_dto(include_fks: bool = False, show_deleted: bool = False) -> BaseDto
        Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses to serialize
        the Django model instance into a domain DTO (derived from `BaseDto`).
        The `include_fks` flag determines whether foreign-key relationships
        should be included in the serialization.
        The `show_deleted` flag indicates whether logically deleted records
        should be included in the DTO representation.

    @abstractmethod
    def as_dto(
        self, include_fks: bool = False, show_deleted: bool = False,
    ) -> BaseDto:
        """
        Serialize the current Django model instance into a domain DTO (BaseDto).

        Parameters
        ----------
        include_fks : bool, optional
            If True, includes related foreign-key entities in the serialization.
        show_deleted : bool, optional
            If True, includes records that were soft-deleted in the output.

        Returns
        -------
        BaseDto
            A Pydantic model representing the corresponding domain entity.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If the subclass does not override this method.
