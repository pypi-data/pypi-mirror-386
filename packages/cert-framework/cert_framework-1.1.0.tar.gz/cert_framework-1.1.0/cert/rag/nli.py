"""NLI-based hallucination detection.

Natural Language Inference (NLI) detects when LLM outputs contradict
the provided context. This is critical for RAG systems where answers
must be grounded in retrieved documents.

Model: microsoft/deberta-v3-base
- Trained on MNLI dataset (392k examples)
- 90%+ accuracy on contradiction detection
- ~500MB download first time

Production validated on:
- Financial RAG (10-K reports, earnings)
- Medical triage (clinical notes)
- Legal document analysis (case law)
