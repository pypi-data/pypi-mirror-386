# Demonstrates one way to reverse the notes in a phrase.

from music import *
 
# create a phrase, add some notes to it, and save it (for comparison)
pitches = [C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4,   C5]    # the C major scale
rhythms = [WN, HN, QN, EN, SN, TN, TN/2, TN/4]  # increasing tempo
 
phrase = Phrase()
phrase.addNoteList( pitches, rhythms )
Write.midi(phrase, "retrogradeBefore.mid") 

### now, a more general way... 

# get the notes from the phrase
noteList = phrase.getNoteList()   # this gives us a list
 
pitches   = []  # create empty lists of pitches
durations = []  # ...and durations
 
# iterate through every note in the note list
for note in noteList:
   # for each note, get its pitch and duration value
   pitches.append( note.getPitch() )      # append this pitch
   durations.append( note.getDuration() ) # append this duration
 
# now, create the retrograde phrase, and save it
pitches.reverse()  # reverse, using the reverse() list operation
durations.reverse() 
 
retrograde = Phrase()
retrograde.addNoteList( pitches, durations )
Write.midi(retrograde, "retrogradeAfter.mid")
