"""
Package initialization for the 'python_apis' package.

This package provides a collection of modules that include APIs, data models, schemas, and services
used throughout the application.

Available submodules:
- **apis**: Contains API interfaces and implementations for interacting with external systems or
    services.
- **models**: Defines the data models representing the structure of the application's data.
- **schemas**: Provides data validation schemas, often using libraries like Pydantic, to ensure
    data integrity.
- **services**: Offers service classes that encapsulate business logic and orchestrate interactions
    between APIs and models.

By importing this package, these main submodules are made available for convenient access and use
in other parts of the application.
