        Generally caches what configuration values we lookup into a dynamo table.
        A good summary would be in the [Config Overview - Caching](../config.html#caching)

        More details about the table struvture its self follows.

        The table has two keys:

        1. Hash key: Is the `environ` method parameter that gets passed to the methods on me.
           It's normally a string in this format: `/{APP_NAME}/{APP_ENV}`.
           Also, normally apps/services are only given access to one specific hash-key.
           This hash-key should represent the app and its current environment.
        2. Range/Sort key: Contains the variable name, providers and directory paths used
           to lookup value. This makes it so the app can do various queries using various
           different providers/directories and the cacher can cache those results correctly
           and uniquely based on the var-name, providers and directories originally
           used to get the value.

        You don't need to parse the rage/sort-key.
        All of its components are also separate attributes in the table on the row.

        ## Dependency Details

        Right now the `DynamoCacher` is a `xinject.dependency.Dependency`
        resource, you can grab the current one by calling `DynamoCacher.grab()`.

        More specifically: we are a `xinject.dependency.Dependency`, which means that there is
        normally only one of us around. See xinject library for more details.

        ## How to Clear Cache

        If you need to change the config and have it propagate asap, you can easily
        just delete all items in the dynamo cache table for cache_key for the service/env.

        So for now, I am giving a long-life to the cached-items, since config changes to
        existing items are rare [if we need a new item and it's not in cache it will be looked
        up immediately and then cached].

        I use a random number to try to help ensure we try not to have synchronous times on when
        various things expire between various different services, to help spread load between
        param store and secrets manager aws api's.

        12 hours in the future with a random +/- 1500 seconds added on is what we currently do.
        Thinking about making it a shorter period of time [a couple of hours].
