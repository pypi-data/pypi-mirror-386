class Provider(Dependency):
    """
    Represents a Provider, which wraps a resource that can be used to store Config values based
    on a provided directory. It caches these directories so future lookups don't keep having to
    fetch them from the Dependency again in the future, while the process is still running.

    Most of the time there is no need for a several of the same provider in the same process/app.

    The providers generally keep a cache of every directory they already looked up, so it's nice to
    share that cache with other Child context's by default via the
    `xinject.dependency.Dependency` mechanism.

    Config will use the current/active provider when it needs to consult a Provider for values.

    Each provider should be careful that they communicate with any remote service in a thread-safe
    manner, as Config objects from other threads could use the same Provider instance.

    Most of the time, network clients are not thread-safe to use, examples include:

    - boto clients/resources are also not thread-safe.
    - Sessions from requests library can't be used cross-thread.

    For boto, if you use `xboto` to grab the boto client/resource,
    it will allow you to lazily get a shared object that is guaranteed to only be shared
    for the current thread.

    This allows boto to reuse connections for things running on the same thread,
    but `xboto` will lazily create a new client if your on a separate thread.

        Given `provider`, we will return a cached object keyed to the `provider` instance.

        If there currently is no cache object for `provider` instance in self,
        and you provide a `cache_constructor`, we will call the `cache_constructor` and provide
        a single positional argument we pass `self` (instance of InternalLocalProviderCache) to.

        If you return a non-None value from this constructor, we will store this value
        as the cache object, keyed under the instance of `provider` and return this same
        object in the future until the cache is expired or reset.

        Otherwise, if you return None your expected to call `set_cache_for_provider` on
        the instance of InternalLocalProviderCache we give the constructor callback.

        If we still don't have a value, and you provided a constructor, we will raise a ValueError.
