        that defaults to Default, that aspect will be disabled/not used. For example, if you
        pass a None for directories/providers, no directories/providers will be searched.

        Parameters
        ---------
        directories: Union[Iterable[xcon.directory.DirectoryOrPath], xsentinels.Default]
            List of directories/paths to search when querying for a name.
            
            If `xsentinels.Default`: Uses the first one from [Parent Chain](#parent-chain).
            
            If everyone in the parent chain is set to `Default`,
            uses `xcon.conf.XconSettings.directories`.

            Various ways to change what directories to use:

            >>> from xsentinels import Default
            >>> 
            >>> with Config(directories=['/some/other/path', Default]):
            ...     # Will first look in `/some/other/path`,
            ...     # if not found next looks at default paths/directories.
            ...     assert config['some_var'] == 'expected-value'

            .. note:: This will also preserves the current service name
                As your just changing the directories used, and not the service name.
                This means the cache-path is not changed, so you don't have to add permissions
                to read/write other cache-path

            If you want to lookup the standard/default ones first, you can do this too:

            >>> my_directories = [
            ...     Default,
            ...     # Directory objects support `{environment}` and `{service}`
            ...     # placeholders in their path.
            ...     Directory(service='other_app', env='{environment}'),
            ...     Directory(service='other_app/all'),  
            ... ]
            >>> with Config(directories=my_directories):
            ...     assert config.get('some_var') == 'expected-value'

            When `Default` is resolved, after the ones your inserting your self,
            it will use the standard app service/env.

            This means it will first look for the two directiores first from other_app,
            and then if it still can't find the var it will next look at the current
            app/service for the var.

        providers: Union[Iterable[Type[xcon.provider.Provider]], xsentinels.DefaultType]
            List of provider types to use. If set to `Default`, uses the first one from
            [Parent Chain](#parent-chain). If everyone in the parent chain is set to `Default`,
            uses `xcon.conf.XconSettings.providers`.

        cacher: Type[xcon.provider.ProviderCacher]
            In the future, I may allow other cachers to be passed in via this param, but right
            now only the DynamoCacher is used and the only values you can use are:

            - If `None`:
                - No flattened high-level caching will be used. The individual
                  providers will still cache things internally per-directory/provider.

            - If left as `xsentinels.Default`:
                - Must have a service/enviroment we can use
                  (ie: APP_ENV / APP_NAME;
                      `xcon.conf.XconSettings.environment` / `xcon.conf.XconSettings.service`
                  ).
                  If so, we will attempt to read/write to a special Dynamo table that has
                  a flattened list of name/value pairs that are tied to the current service,
                  enviroment, directory-chain, provider-chain at the time the value is asked for.

            The cacher-path will use current service/environment
            (`APP_ENV` / `APP_NAME`;
            `xcon.conf.XconSettings.environment` / `xcon.conf.XconSettings.service`
            ).

            If you want change where you lookup variables without effecting the cacher-path,
            you can change the directories that Config uses.

            See below on `service` and `directories` paramters for examples/details.

        use_parent: bool
            [Parent Chain](#parent-chain) is used to find:

               - Overridden config values; these are values that set directly
                 on the Config object; ie: `xcon.config.config`.CONFIG_NAME = "Some Value to Override With"

               - Default values; these are used when config can find no other value for a
                 particular .CONFIG_NAME. See `set_default`

               - Default directories: Use parent directories by default.

               - Default providers: Use parent providers by default.

            The overridden/defaults/directory/providers 'inherit' up the config's
            [Parent Chain](#parent-chain).

            This makes it easy to override values in some parent... perhaps in a unit-test, or
            while a documentation generator is running, or if some library your calling
            wants to use a different set of providers, etc....

            If you pass a `use_parent=False`, no parent will be used or consulted. If anyone
            in the [Parent Chain](#parent-chain) has `use_parent==false`, the parent-chain
            will stop there.

            By `xsentinels.Default`:
               We lookup the parent by getting the current Config via current XContext;
               If that's ourselves, then we grab the parent context's Config resource.
               This lookup occurs every time we are asked for a .CONFIG_NAME to see if
               there is an override for it, etc. [see `parent is used to find` section above].
               That means the Config's parent can change depending on the current context the
               time the .CONFIG_NAME is asked for.

        defaults: Union[xcon.directory.DirectoryListing, Dict[str, Any], xsentinels.Default]
            If `defaults` are provided, these values will be used when Config is asked for
            something that does not exist anywhere else. ie: Has not been overridden [by directly
            setting value on Config or a parent Config], and also not in any provider.

            Basically, if Config can't find a value anywhere else, it will as a last-resort
            check these defaults. If a value in defaults is present for the configuration
            name/key in question, the value in defaults will be returned.
            This default value is NOT cached via the DynamoCacher [in-fact, the DynamoCacher will
            cache the fact that the config var in question does not exist]. If the cacher reports
            that a particular var does not exist [reminder: the cache entries eventually expire]
            we skip checking the providers and just check the defaults.

            See the Config class doc, and the 'Search Order' section.

        environment: Dict[str, Default]
            Used to easily override the `APP_ENV` / `xcon.conf.XconSettings.environment`.
            Infact, `__init__` will simply do this if you provide a value for `environment`:

            >>> self.environment = environment

            Can be used when APP_ENV is needed mainly for constructing default directory paths
            (ie: `/{APP_NAME}/{APP_ENV}/...`) but not effect the cacher's hash-key at the same
            time.
            
            The cacher always uses `xcon.conf.XconSettings.environment` for it's dynamo table
            hash-key.  That way whatever xcon_settings are looked up from alternet environment/service
            names; it won't try to write them into that apps service/enviroment cached values.
            
            It will keep the newley cached values into the `xcon.conf.XconSettings.service`
            and `xcon.conf.XconSettings.enviroment` hash-value.
            
            It will still keep track of the values in the overriden service/enviroment
            via the dynamo tables range-key, so things will still be properly/sepeatly
            cached correctly.


        service: Dict[str, Default]
            Used to easily override the `APP_NAME` / `xcon.conf.XconSettings.service`.
            Infact, `__init__` will simply do this if you provide a value for `service`:

            >>> self.service = service

            Can be used when APP_ENV is needed mainly for constructing default directory paths
            (ie: `/{APP_NAME}/{APP_ENV}/...`) but not effect the cacher's hash-key at the same
            time.
            
            The cacher always uses `xcon.conf.XconSettings.environment` for it's dynamo table
            hash-key.  That way whatever xcon_settings are looked up from alternet environment/service

        Someday we may make it easier to publicly go through the parents
        (right now there are internal/private methods that do this).

        If you don't like an override, you can override the override by setting an override
        on a child/current `Config` object (see `Config.set_override`).

        Probably should not mess with config objects from higher up that you don't know
        anything about in any case.  That's why I've hesitated about publicly exposing
        the parent chain too much.


        You can remove overrides in various ways, such as:

        ```python
        from xcon import config
        from xsentinels import Default

        # Alternate Method 1:
        config.SOME_NAME = Default

        # Alternate Method 2:
        config.set_override("SOME_NAME", Default)
        ```

        At the moment these ways ^ will not remove an override from a parent.

        If we do decide we want an ability  to "white-out" an override;
        I would probably do it such that you could tell a child to not check parent(s)
        overrides on a specific value
        (ie: I would set the override value to `Default` on self internally, to indicate that).

            this until we reach a XContext without a parent or a `Config.use_parent` that is False.

            We take out of the chain any config object that is myself. The only objects in
            the chain are other Config object instances.

            The parent chain is generally consulted when we encounter a `Default` value.
            If when reaching the last parent in the chain, we still have a `Default` value,

    Gives you the standard list of directories for service/env combination.
    This is called when creating a `Config.__init__` if no `directories` are passed into any
    Config object in the [Parent Chain](#parent-chain).

    Normally you would want to use Config.directories = [Default]; which would cause the
    Config object to ask it's parent chain, and they are also all set to `Default` then
    it will call this `standard_directories` method for you to get the `Default` directories.

    If for some reason you want to custimize or use diffrent service/env names for addtional
    directory paths to check beyond the defaults, you can call this method and append them to
    a config object, like so:

    >>> from xcon.config import config
    >>> for directory in standard_directories(service="customService", env="customEnv"):
    ...     config.add_directory(directory)

    The code ^ above would keep the default directory as the first one(s) to look at to the
    current/default config. After looking at the pre-existing default ones it would next look
    at your customService/customEnv paths too afterwards. Finally, Config would then look at
    any ones added via `Config.add_export`.

    ## Whats Returned Summary

    For more details and context surounding what is returned, see
    [Standard Directory Paths](#standard-directory-paths). Below is a summary.

    As a side-note: you can change the default directories via
    `xcon.conf.XconSettings.directories`,
    so if that changes then what this returns will also change.

    Right now we return these directories by default, in priority order:

    1. `/{service}/{env}`
    2. `/{service}/all`
    3. `/global/{env}`
    4. `/global/all`

    If service == 'global' or None or blank, we will use `global` and only provide the two
    global directories and leave the {service} ones out of it:

    1. `/global/{env}`
    2. `/global/all`

    If there is no `env` avaliable, `env` will just only use `../all`

    Parameters
    -----------
    service: str
        The name of the service, generally the project's name, in camelCase.
        You can grab the current service being used via `Config.SERVICE_NAME`.

        If None/Blank, we will use `global`.

    env: str
        Environment, could be 'testing', 'prod', or something custom like 'yourName',
        this is also generally in `camelCase`.

        You can grab the current environment being used via `Config.resolved_environment`.

        If None/Blank, we will use `all`.
