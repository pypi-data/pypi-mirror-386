# Notes:
#
# You can include this file under the `resources:` section of your serverless file.
#
# It will add permissions to your lambda functions to access the ssm param store,
# and limits the config variables it can see via the standard directory paths.
#
# If you want to use alternate directory paths, you can take a copy of this file and
# adjust the paths as needed.
