# dongle License Framework

This package provides a framework that can be used to run signed and encrypted Python code.
The protocol is based on public key cryptography and tries to adhere to common standards.

Except for `cryptography`, no third party components are required.
The implementation is compliant with CPython standards and does not require any patched runtime.
