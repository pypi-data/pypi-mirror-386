You are tasked with compacting a coding conversation context. This is critical for maintaining an effective working memory for the coding agent.

**Compression Priorities (in order):**
1. **Current Task State**: What is being worked on RIGHT NOW
2. **Errors & Solutions**: All encountered errors and their resolutions
3. **Code Evolution**: Final working versions only (remove intermediate attempts)
4. **System Context**: Project structure, dependencies, environment setup
5. **Design Decisions**: Architectural choices and their rationale
6. **TODO Items**: Unfinished tasks and known issues

**Compression Rules:**
- MUST KEEP: Error messages, stack traces, working solutions, current task
- MERGE: Similar discussions into single summary points
- REMOVE: Redundant explanations, failed attempts (keep lessons learned), verbose comments
- CONDENSE: Long code blocks â†’ keep signatures + key logic only

**Special Handling:**
- For code: Keep full version if < 20 lines, otherwise keep signature + key logic
- For errors: Keep full error message + final solution
- For discussions: Extract decisions and action items only

**Input Context to Compress:**

${CONTEXT}

**Required Output Structure:**
