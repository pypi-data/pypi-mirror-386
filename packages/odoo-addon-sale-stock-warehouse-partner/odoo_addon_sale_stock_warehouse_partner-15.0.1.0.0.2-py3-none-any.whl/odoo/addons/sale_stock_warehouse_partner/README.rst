This module allows setting a **warehouse** on partner records and applies
a priority sequence when creating a Sale Order. If the warehouse is defined 
at a higher-priority level, it will override the lower ones. Priority are defined
following next order: `partner_shipping_id`, `partner_id` and last `user_id`.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
