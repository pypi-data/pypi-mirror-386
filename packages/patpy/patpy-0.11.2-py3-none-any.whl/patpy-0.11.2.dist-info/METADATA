# patpy – sample-level analysis framework for single-cell data

<img src="./docs/_static/patpy_logo.png" width="100px">

patpy is a toolbox for single-cell data analysis on sample level.

It provides:
- 👨‍⚕️ Interface to sample representation methods (otherwise known as patient representation)
- 📈 Analysis functions to get the most of your data
- 📊 Metrics for sample representation evaluation

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][link-docs]. In particular, the

-   [API documentation][link-api].

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.9 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

There are several alternative options to install patpy:


1. Install the latest release of `patpy` from [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/project/patpy/):

```bash
pip install patpy
```

2. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/lueckenlab/patpy.git@main
```

To install specific dependencies for some sample representation tools, use the following command:

```bash
pip install patpy[pilot]
```

All the available dependency groups: `diffusionemd`, `mrvi`, `pilot`, `scpoli`, `wassersteintsne`.

## Release notes

See the [changelog][changelog].

## Contact

For questions and help requests, you can reach out in the [scverse discourse][scverse-discourse].
If you found a bug, please use the [issue tracker][issue-tracker].

## Building docs

1. Install [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html)

You may need add path to `sphinx-doc` to the `$PATH`

2. Install other `doc` section dependencies from the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/lueckenlab/patpy/blob/main/pyproject.toml)

3. Build the documentation pages:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

4. Open `docs/_build/html/index.html`
