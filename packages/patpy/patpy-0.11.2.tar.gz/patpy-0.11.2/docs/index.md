# patpy

patpy is a toolbox for single-cell data analysis on sample level.

![overview](./_static/patpy_pipeline.png)

It provides:
- üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Interface to sample representation methods (otherwise known as patient representation)
- üìà Analysis functions to get the most of your data
- üìä Metrics for sample representation evaluation

## Citation

For now, patpy can be cited as a repository:
```bibtex
@misc{shitov_patpy_2024,
  author = {Shitov, Vladimir},
  title = {patpy ‚Äì sample-level analysis framework for single-cell data},
  year = {2024},

  note = {Version 0.9.2}
}
```

If you use it for benchmarking sample representation methods, check out our paper at LMRL workshop at ICLR:
