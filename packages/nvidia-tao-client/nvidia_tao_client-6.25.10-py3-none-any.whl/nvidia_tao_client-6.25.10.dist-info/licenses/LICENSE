                                    IMPORTANT NOTICE – PLEASE READ AND AGREE BEFORE USING NVIDIA AI PRODUCTS.

This AI Product Agreement is entered into between the entity you represent or you individually if you do not designate an entity (“Customer”) and NVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”). This AI Product Agreement consists of the terms and conditions below and all documents attached to or referenced in this AI Product Agreement (together, the “Agreement”). The AI Product catalogs include products that can be used without payment and paid products and services. Key terms are defined in Section 17.

By using or registering to use AI Products, Customer is affirming that Customer has read the Agreement and agrees to its terms. If Customer does not have the required authority to enter into the Agreement or if Customer does not accept all the terms and conditions below, do not use (or register to use) AI Products.

1. AI PRODUCTS OFFERINGS.

1.1  Grant. Subject to the terms of the Agreement, Customer’s Order Agreement and Subscription or Perpetual license parameters, and payment of applicable fees, NVIDIA grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly provided in the Agreement) license to do the following for the duration of the license:

1.1.1 install and use copies of AI Products,

1.1.2 create Derivative Samples and Derivative Models to develop and test services and applications,

1.1.3 configure the AI Product using the configuration files provided (as applicable),

1.1.4 deploy AI Products, and Derivative Samples and Derivative Models Customer develops as authorized in Section 1.1.2, on infrastructure Customer owns or leases to offer a service, without distributing AI Products, Derivative Samples and Derivative Models, and

1.1.5 develop and extend AI Products, and Derivative Samples and Derivative Models Customer develops as authorized in Section 1.1.2, to develop Compatible Applications, and deploy and distribute such Compatible Applications.

Notwithstanding the grants above, users that receive an Enterprise Product identified as “not for resale” or “NFR”, typically a license to a distributor or reseller, may exercise the grants in Section 1.1.1, Section 1.1.2 and Section 1.1.3 above solely for internal evaluation or to demonstrate the Enterprise Product to others, and the grants in Section 1.1.4 and Section 1.1.5 are excluded such that no production deployment or distribution is authorized.

1.2 Authorized Users. Customer’s and its subsidiaries’ employees and contractors may access and use the AI Products from Customer devices to perform work authorized by the Agreement on Customer’s behalf. If Customer is an academic institution, Customer may allow users enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and use the AI Products as authorized by the Agreement from Customer’s devices. Customer is responsible for the compliance with the terms of the Agreement by Customer’s authorized users. Any act or omission that if committed by Customer would constitute a breach of the Agreement will be deemed to constitute a breach of the Agreement if committed by Customer’s authorized users.

1.3 License Types. The terms in this Section 1.3 apply only to Enterprise Products, not to Community Products. The license types below describe features that may be part of an Enterprise Product; and not all license types may be available for each Enterprise Product. Enterprise Products are licensed under the following license types: Subscription per CPU Socket, Subscription per GPU, Subscription per Node, Usage Based Subscription, or Perpetual license. Once a certain Enterprise Product is under a paid Subscription or Perpetual license, all Customer’s licenses to such Enterprise Product must be under a paid Subscription or Perpetual license. Customer’s order, license key or the product description will indicate the parameters of Customer’s license.

1.4 Replacement Products. NVIDIA may, from time to time at its discretion, give Customer the option to replace a certain Enterprise Product, subject to payment of applicable fees. In such cases, Customer must discontinue use of the replaced Enterprise Product timely upon the start of use of the replacement Enterprise Product. If requested in writing by NVIDIA, Customer will provide a written certificate signed by an authorized officer affirming Customer’s compliance with the replacement terms.

1.5 Promotional Offerings. NVIDIA may, from time to time, offer free or discounted pricing programs covering certain uses of Enterprise Products, as examples having different license parameters or fees for evaluation or academic use. NVIDIA may stop accepting new sign-ups or discontinue a promotional offering at any time. Standard charges will apply after a promotional offering ends or if Customer exceeds the promotional offering use terms. Customer must comply with any additional terms, restrictions, or limitations (e.g., limitations on the total amount of usage) for a promotional offering as described in the corresponding offer terms.

1.5.1 NVIDIA Riva offer. NVIDIA Riva is a Community Product for up to 90 days, and beyond this limit, requires an Enterprise Product Subscription. This is a one-time offer and subsequent use of NVIDIA Riva without an Enterprise Product Subscription requires a written agreement with NVIDIA.

3    AI ETHICS. Technology can have a profound impact on people and the world, and NVIDIA is committed to enabling trust and transparency in AI development. NVIDIA encourages Customer to adopt principles of AI ethics and trustworthiness to guide Customer’s business decisions by doing the following:

4    PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS AND FEATURES. The AI Products versions and features identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise in pre-release may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercially provided NVIDIA software, materials and services. Use of a pre-release version or feature may result in unexpected results, such as loss of use or loss of content. Customer may use a pre-release version or feature at Customer’s risk, understanding that such versions are not intended for use in business-critical systems and Customer may stop using pre-release versions at Customer’s convenience. NVIDIA may choose not to provide Enterprise Support for such pre-release versions and NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release AI Product. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a pre-release AI Product at any time without liability. Pre-release versions are provided “as-is,” “with all faults,” and “as-available,” and are excluded from ENTERPRISE support and all limited warranties provided in thE Agreement.

5    ENTERPRISE SUPPORT. Enterprise Support is included as part of a Subscription and may be sold separately for Perpetual licenses.
