    """
    Periodically scans the backend for delayed jobs that are due for processing
    and moves them to the active queue.

    This function runs continuously in an infinite loop, sleeping for a
    specified `interval` between scans. In each scan, it queries the `backend`
    for delayed jobs associated with `queue_name` that have passed their
    `delay_until` timestamp. For each due job found, it removes it from the
    backend's delayed storage and re-enqueues it into the main queue for
    processing by workers.

    Args:
        queue_name: The name of the queue whose delayed jobs should be scanned.
        backend: An object providing the necessary interface for interacting
                 with the queue storage, including methods like `get_due_delayed`,
                 `remove_delayed`, and `enqueue`. If `None`, the default backend
                 from `settings` is used.
        interval: The time in seconds to wait between consecutive scans for
                  due delayed jobs. Defaults to 2.0 seconds.
