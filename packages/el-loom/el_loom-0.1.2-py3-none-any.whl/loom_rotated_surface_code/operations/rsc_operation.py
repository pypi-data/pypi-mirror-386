@dataclass(**dataclass_params)
class MoveBlock(CodeOperation):
    """
    Move the selected block 1-unit in the chosen direction, in a fault tolerant manner.
    The SWAP operation occurs as part of the syndrome extraction round allowing for
    the block to be fault tolerant throughout the move.

    NOTE: 1-unit is defined as the distance between two adjacent qubits (with equal unit vectors) in the block.
    i.e. (0, 0, 0) -> (1, 0, 0) is a 1-unit move in the x-direction(or to the "right").

    The possible directions are:
    1. Direction.TOP (top) - (Moving the Block towards the top, all qubits are shifted by (0, -1, 0)
    2. Direction.BOTTOM (bottom) - (Moving the Block towards the bottom, all qubits are shifted by (0, 1, 0)
    3. Direction.LEFT (left) - (Moving the Block towards the left, all qubits are shifted by (-1, 0, 0)
    4. Direction.RIGHT (right) - (Moving the Block towards the right, all qubits are shifted by (1, 0, 0)

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_block_name : str
        Name of the block to move.
    direction: Direction
        Direction in which to move the block.

class LogicalPhaseViaYwall(CodeOperation):
    """Apply a logical phase gate to a RotatedSurfaceCode block by:
    1. Growing it towards the right/left or bottom/top depending on the orientation of
    the X boundary of the block. If the X boundary is horizontal, the block can be
    grown to the right or left. If the X boundary is vertical, the block can be
    grown to the top or bottom.
    2. Moving corners
    3. Measuring a wall of qubits in the Y basis
    4. Getting the block back to its original size

    TODO: To be able to freely specify the direction of growth, we need boundary
    rotation such that we can change the orientation of the X boundary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_block_name : str
        Name of the block to apply the logical phase gate.
    growth_direction : Direction
        Direction in which to grow the block. This is the direction of the X boundary
        of the block. If the X boundary is horizontal, the block has to be grown to the
        right or left. If the X boundary is vertical, the block has to be grown to the
