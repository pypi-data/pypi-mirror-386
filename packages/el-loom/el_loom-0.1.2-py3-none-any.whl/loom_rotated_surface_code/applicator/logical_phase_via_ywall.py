    Apply the logical phase via y-wall operation.
    The algorithm is the following:

    - A.) Run consistency checks
    - B.) Relocate the x logical operator to the appropriate position
    - C.) Grow the block
    - D.) Move a corner to prepare for the y-wall operation
    - E.) Measure the syndromes
    - F.) Apply the y_wall_out operation
    - G.) Move all topological corners back to their geometric positions and \
    potentially grow the block towards the initial position
    - H.) Shrink the block
    - I.) Relocate the x logical operator to the initial position
    - J.) Wrap the circuit in a single circuit with the correct duration and empty \
    timeslices

    measurement of the block syndromes if there are missing syndromes.
