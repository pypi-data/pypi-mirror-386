    The input SyndromeCircuit requires a specific design where the ancilla qubits

    The function replaces the two-qubit gate with a new gate that measures the new_pauli.
    If the new pauli is a Z, the function replaces the two-qubit gate with a CZ gate.
    If the new pauli is an X, the function replaces the two-qubit gate with a CX gate.
