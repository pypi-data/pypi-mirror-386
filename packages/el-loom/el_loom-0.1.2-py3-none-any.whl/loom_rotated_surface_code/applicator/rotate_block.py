    """
    Rotate the boundary of a rotated surface code block by growing it in the specified
    direction, moving the corners in a fault-tolerant manner and shrinking back to the
    original size.

    The rotation is performed by:
    - A) VALIDITY CHECKS
        - A.1) Check that the block is a valid RotatedSurfaceCode block for
                RotateBlock
    - B) GROW THE BLOCK IN THE SPECIFIED DIRECTION
        - B.1) Grow the block to double its size minus one in the specified direction
        - B.2) Measure syndromes to complete the grow operation
        - B.3) Move the logical operators so that they are correctly located on the
                top-left qubit of the grown block
    - C) MOVE THE CORNERS APPROPRIATELY
        - C.1) Move each corner individually
        - C.2) Measure syndromes to complete the corner move in a fault-tolerant manner
    - D) SHRINK THE BLOCK
        - D.1) Shrink the block from the grown side by distance - 2
        - D.2) Shrink the block from the opposite side by 1 to return to original size
    - E) MOVE BLOCK
        - E.1) Move the block so that it's occupying the same data qubits as initially
        - E.2) Move the logical operators so that they are correctly located on the
                top-left qubit of the shrunk block
    - F) WRAP THE CIRCUIT
        - F.1) Isolate the circuit corresponding to the RotateBlock operation and append
                it as a single Circuit object to the intermediate circuit sequence


    Parameters:
    ------------------
    interpretation_step : InterpretationStep
        The current interpretation step containing the block to be rotated.
    operation : RotateBlock
        The RotateBlock operation specifying the block and direction.
    same_timeslice : bool
        Flag to apply the operation in the same timeslice as the previous operation(s).
    debug_mode: bool
        Flag to apply validation of the new block or not.

    Returns:
    ------------------
    InterpretationStep
        The updated interpretation step after applying the RotateBlock operation.
