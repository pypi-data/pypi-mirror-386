    """
    Converts a Circuit object into a CliffordSim Circuit.

    NOTE: Qubit indices are remapped for now as the Circuit Object
    does not contain any information about qubit indices.

    NOTE: If input_circuit contains classical channels, additional operations will be
    added that create classical registers at the start and record the classical
    registers at the end of the circuit. The classical registers are created based on
    the labels of the classical channels. The first set of letters, separated by an _,
    in the label of the classical channel is the name of the classical register.

    TODO: Resolved Mapping Issue but external requirement of data qubit map as input
    might be an issue. Maybe dqubit_dict or the final output from extract_qubits should
    be information "uploaded" onto the CRD as well. (As this contains information about
    the ancilla qubit which was previously not available. i.e. what qubit indices are they)


    Parameter
    ---------
    input_circuit: Circuit
    dqubits_dict: dict

    Returns
    -------
    list[cliffordsim.operations.Operation]
        A list containing CliffordSim Operations that represent the original
        `input_circuit`. This list can be passed into CliffordSim's Engine
        to be simulated.
