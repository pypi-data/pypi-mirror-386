    An operation that creates a Classical Register within the Engine that can be

    their respective bit IDs or bit ordering as provided by the user.

    must be equal to the number of bits in the register.

    Example of valid Classical Register:
    CreateClassicalRegister(reg_name="testreg", no_of_bits=3, bit_ids=["bit_id_1",
    "bit_id_2", "bit_id_3"])

    Parameters
    ----------
    reg_name: str
        The name of the classical register. This name will be used by cliffordsim to
        identify the classical register being referred to by the user.
    no_of_bits: int
        The number of bits to initialize the register with. Default is 1.
    bit_ids: list[str]
        The bit IDs of all the bits in the register. Example input: ["bit_id_1",
        "bit_id_2", "bit_id_3"].
        The number of bit IDs provided must be equal to the number of bits in the
