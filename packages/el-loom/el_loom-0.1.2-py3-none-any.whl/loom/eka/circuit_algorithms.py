    """
    Computes the entangling layer order for a CSS code specified through a Tanner graph.
    This layering is obtained by the coloration circuit algorithm described in
    arXiv:2109.14609. In summary, the algorithm measures X and Z stabilizers in
    sequence, but optimizes the circuit depth for each type. This is done by extracting
    the X and Z subcomponents of the Tanner graph, and by obtaining a minimum edge
    coloring for each one. The sequence of entangling gates then corresponds to all the
    edges in each coloring layer, and then switching to the stabilizer type once the
    first component has been exhausted. Since the Tanner Graph is bipartite, this
    approach results in an upper bound of of max(deg(t_graph_x)) + max(deg(t_graph_z))
    for the total number of entangling layers, where t_graph_x and t_graph_z are the X
    and Z tanner subcomponents, respectively.

    The function returns a dictionary, where the keys correspond to each check nodes
    associated with a Stabilizer, and the values are the lists of data qubit channels
    in the precise order in which the entangling gates should be applied. Idling steps are
    added for Z(X) checks when the entangling gates between X(Z) ancillas and datas take
    place.
