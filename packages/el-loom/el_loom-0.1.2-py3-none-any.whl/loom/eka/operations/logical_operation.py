class LogicalOperation(Operation):
    """
    Parent class for all logical operations in the Eka. All logical operations acts
    on logical qubits. Details of implementation are abstracted away, including how the
    qubits are constructed. E.g. they may be constructed from multiple blocks with a
    single qubit each, or from a single block with multiple qubits.

    Note that these operations only modify the state of the logical qubits, they do not
    perform any code level operations like making sure the structure of the code is
    preserved (e.g. a block ends up being rotated).
