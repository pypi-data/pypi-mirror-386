class Lattice:
    """
    A lattice object contains information about the lattice structure. The lattice
    defines the indexing system of qubits, since qubits are indexed by their coordinates
    in terms of the lattice and basis vectors.

    Note that this lattice on which stabilizers, logical qubit blocks, and lattice
    surgery operations are defined, is a priori only an abstract lattice which makes
    defining all these things and handling qubit indices convenient. It does not have to
    be the actual lattice of the physical hardware.

    Qubit indices have the form `(x_0, ..., x_{n-1}, b)` where `x_0, ..., x_{n-1}`
    denote the unit cell with `n` the dimension of the lattice and `b` denotes which
    qubit in the unit cell it is.

    E.g. for a 2D lattice with a 2-qubit unit cell, the qubit indices are `(x, y, b)`
    which means that it is the `x`-th unit cell along the first lattice vector, the
    `y`-th unit cell along the second lattice vector, and the `b`-th qubit in the unit
    cell (b is either 0 or 1 in the case of a 2-qubit unit cell).

    Parameters
    ----------
    basis_vectors : tuple[tuple[float, ...], ...]
        Tuple of basis vectors that define the unit cell. If there is more than one
        qubit in the unit cell, one has to specify their position inside the unit cell
        using the basis vectors.
    lattice_vectors : tuple[tuple[float, ...], ...]
        Tuple of lattice vectors that define the lattice. The whole lattice is obtained
        by translating the unit cell along these lattice vectors by integer amounts.
    size : tuple[int, ...] | None
        The size of the lattice in each dimension. If set to None, the lattice is
        assumed to be infinitely large.
    lattice_type : LatticeType
        Type of the lattice. This is useful for storing the lattice as well as for some
        function such as `Block` creation which behave differently for different lattice
        types. Default is LatticeType.CUSTOM which means the lattice is created by the
        user.

        Generates a lattice of n-sided polygons. The points are placed on a circle
        of radius `poly_radius` and arranged in a polygonal pattern. The lattice does
        not tile the plane, but is useful for certain applications where polygonal
        symmetry is desired.

        Lattice vectors are defined such that the distance between adjacent unit cells
        is `poly_radius * cell_dist_factor`. Each unit cell contains n + anc points
        (`n` qubits, `anc` ancilla). The `anc` points are placed on a circle of radius
        `anc_radius`. If `anc` is set to 1, ancilla will be placed at the center of the
        polygon.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lattice_size : tuple[int, int] | None, optional
            The size of the lattice in terms of unit cells. If None, the lattice is
            assumed to be infinitely large.
        n : int, optional
            The number of sides of the polygon. Default is 5 (pentagon).
        poly_radius : float | int, optional
            The radius of the circle on which the points are placed. Default is 0.5.
        poly_offset : float | int, optional
            The offset to be applied to the angle of the points on the circle. This
            is useful for placing the first point at a specific angle. Default is
            -0.5 * np.pi (top of circle).
        cell_dist_factor : float | int, optional
            The factor by which the distance between adjacent unit cells is multiplied.
            This is useful for adjusting the distance between the polygons. Default is
            (1 + np.sqrt(3)) as a purely aesthetic choice to ensure that the
            polygons are not too close together.
        anc : int, optional
            The number of ancilla qubits in the unit cell. Default is 1. If anc is set
            to 1, ancilla will be placed at the center of the polygon and at the center
            of the edges of the polygon.
        anc_radius : float | int, optional
            The radius of the circle on which the ancilla points are placed. Default is
            0.2.
        anc_offset : float | int, optional
            The offset to be applied to the angle of the ancilla points on the circle.
            This is useful for placing the first ancilla point at a specific angle.
            Default is -0.5 * np.pi (top of circle).
        anc_disp : tuple[int | float, int | float], optional
            The displacement of the ancilla points from the center of the circle. This
            is useful for placing the ancilla points at a specific position in the 2D
            plane. Default is (0, 0).
