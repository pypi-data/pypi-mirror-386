    A serializable, recursive circuit representation. Previously defined circuit
    structures can be either reused as nested circuit elements or identified by name
    only for compression

    Parameter
    ---------
    name: str
        The name of the circuit/operation, identifying its behaviour: e.g. "Hadamard",
        "CNOT" or "entangle" for the combination of a Hadamard and a CNOT gate.

    circuit: tuple[tuple[Circuit, ...], ...]
        Alternative inputs are: Circuit, list[Circuit], list[list[Circuit]], ...
        Pydantic type conversion accepts all inputs stated here:
        https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/conversion_table/

        The list of nested circuit elements. The outer tuple represents the time step
        (tick) that the enclosed circuits are executed at. The inner tuple
        contains parallel circuits that are executed at the same time step. So each
        channel can only operated on by one circuit each tick.

        An input of a 1D list/tuple of circuits is interpreted as a sequence of
        circuits. So each circuit is executed at its own tick and after the execution
        of the previous circuit is complete.

    channels: tuple[Channel, ...]
        Alternative inputs are: Channel, list[Channel], set[Channel], ...
        Pydantic type conversion accepts all inputs stated in the link above.

        The list of channels involved in the circuit

        Construct a padded circuit time sequence.

        The input is a tuple of tuples of circuits, where each tuple of circuits
        represents a time step. Each time step may be of variable duration.
        The output is a tuple of tuples of circuits that includes empty tuples which
        represent time steps where the circuit is busy because of a composite
        sub-circuit.

        Note that the scheduling is done following the time structure of the input,
        if two composite circuits exist in the same time step, they will start at the
        same time but may end at different times. If there are conflicts between
        subsequent circuits, add the minimum amount of padding such that the circuit
        can be executed. The last composite circuit's padding will automatically be
        added since it is the last element in the sequence.

        E.g.:

        .. code-block:: python

            hadamard = Circuit("hadamard", channels=channels[0], duration=1)
            cnot = Circuit("cnot", channels=channels[0:2], duration=2)

                (hadamard),
                (cnot,),
            )

        Constructing the padded circuit time sequence would result in:

        .. code-block:: python

            padded_circuit_time_sequence = (
                (hadamard,),
                (cnot,),
                (),
            )

        Similarly, if the input is:

        .. code-block:: python

            circuit_time_sequence = (
                (cnot),
                (hadamard,),
            )

        The padded circuit time sequence would be:

        .. code-block:: python

            padded_circuit_time_sequence = (
                (cnot,),
                (),
                (hadamard,),
            )

        To illustrate two circuits that are executed at the same time, but of variable
        duration:

        .. code-block:: python

            hadamard_2 = Circuit("hadamard_2", channels=channels[2], duration=1)
            circuit_time_sequence = (
                (cnot, hadamard_2,)
            )

        The padded circuit time sequence would be:

        .. code-block:: python

            padded_circuit_time_sequence = (
                (cnot, hadamard_2,),
                (),
            )

        where the cnot would span two time steps and hadamard_2 only one.

        Parameters

        circuit_time_sequence : tuple[tuple[Circuit, ...], ...]
            The circuit time sequence to be padded.
