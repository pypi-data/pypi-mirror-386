) -> InterpretationStep:
    """
    Resets all ancilla qubits of a block to a specific SingleQubitPauliEigenstate.

    NOTE: Initializing a Y state may come with some caveats, as the implementation of
    the initialization may not be fault-tolerant for some codes. For example, in the
    case of the Rotated Surface Code, initializing a Y state may require distillation
    for it to be fault-tolerant.

    TODO: This function may need to reset the tracking of Pauli faults on the data
    qubits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    interpretation_step : InterpretationStep
        Interpretation step containing the blocks whose ancilla qubits need to be reset.
    operation : ResetAllAncillaQubits
        Reset ancilla operation description.
    same_timeslice : bool
        Flag indicating whether the operation is part of the same timestep as the
        previous operation.
    debug_mode : bool
        Flag indicating whether the interpretation should be done in debug mode.
        Activating debug mode will enable commutation validation for Block.

    Returns
    -------
    InterpretationStep
        Interpretation step after the reset ancilla operation.
