    """
    Resets all data qubits of a block to a specific SingleQubitPauliEigenstate.
    It also adds empty Syndrome objects for the stabilizers will be deterministic in
    the first round of syndrome measurement cycles dependent on the
    initialization state. This helps to put Detectors on these deterministic
    measurements when the block is measured.

    NOTE: Initializing a Y state may come with some caveats, as the implementation of
    the initialization may not be fault-tolerant for some codes. For example, in the
    case of the Rotated Surface Code, initializing a Y state may require distillation
    for it to be fault-tolerant.

    TODO: This function may need to reset the tracking of Pauli faults on the data
    qubits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    interpretation_step : InterpretationStep
        Interpretation step containing the blocks whose data qubits need to be reset.
    operation : ResetAllDataQubits
        Reset data operation description.
    same_timeslice : bool
        Flag indicating whether the operation is part of the same timestep as the
        previous operation.
    debug_mode : bool
        Flag indicating whether the interpretation should be done in debug mode.
        Activating debug mode will enable commutation validation for Block

    Returns
    -------
    InterpretationStep
        Interpretation step after the reset data operation.
