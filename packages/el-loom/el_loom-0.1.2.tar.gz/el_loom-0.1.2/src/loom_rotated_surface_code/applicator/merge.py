    Check if the blocks are compatible for merging. Also re-orders the blocks so
    that block1 is the left or top block and block2 is the right or bottom block. This
    is required for the rest of the workflow to function properly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    interpretation_step : InterpretationStep
        InterpretationStep containing the blocks to merge.
    operation : Merge
        Descriptor of the merge operation to perform.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[RotatedSurfaceCode, RotatedSurfaceCode]
        The blocks to merge, ordered so that block1 is the left or top block and
        block2 is the right or bottom block.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the blocks are not compatible for merging. The blocks are compatible if:
        (1) They do not overlap (this should already be enforced).
        (2) The blocks' upper left corner qubits are aligned (either horizontally or
        vertically).
        (3) The blocks have the same size in the direction normal to the merge.
        (4) The boundaries to be merged are of the same type.
        (5) The alternate pattern of stabilizers is preserved. I.e. the blocks have the
        same upper left 4-body stabilizer if the distance is even, different stabilizer
        if the distance is odd.
        (6) There needs to be at least one row/column of data qubits between the two
        blocks.
        (7) The blocks have a single logical operator.
        Also raises a ValueError if the orientation specified in the operation does not
        match the default orientation.
