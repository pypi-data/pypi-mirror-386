    Parameters
    ----------
    interpretation_step : InterpretationStep
        Input interpretation step.
    new_control : RotatedSurfaceCode
        New control block after the AuxCNOT operations.
    initial_target : RotatedSurfaceCode
        Target block before the the AuxCNOT operations.
    aux_block : RotatedSurfaceCode
        Auxiliary block for the AuxCNOT operation.
    new_target : RotatedSurfaceCode
        New target block after the AuxCNOT operations.
    shrink_direction : Direction
        Direction in which the target block was shrunk.
    same_timeslice : bool
        Flag indicating whether the operation is part of the same timestep as the input.
    debug_mode : bool
        Flag indicating whether the interpretation should be done in debug mode.
