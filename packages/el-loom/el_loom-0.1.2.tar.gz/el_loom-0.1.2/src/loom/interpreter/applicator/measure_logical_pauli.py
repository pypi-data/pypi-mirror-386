    """
    Measure a logical Pauli operator. Y logical measurements are not supported yet.

    The algorithm is the following:
    
    - A.) Measure all data qubits in the block
    - B.) Update Syndromes for all stabilizers involved in the data qubits measured
    - C.) Create the logical observable including measured data qubits and all \
    previous corrections

    Parameters
    ----------
    interpretation_step : InterpretationStep
        The interpretation step to which the operation should be applied.
    operation : MeasureLogicalX | MeasureLogicalY | MeasureLogicalZ
        The operation to be applied, can either be a logical X, Y or Z measurement.
    same_timeslice : bool
        Flag indicating whether the operation is part of the same timestep as the
        previous operation.
    debug_mode : bool
        Flag indicating whether the interpretation should be done in debug mode.
        Activating debug mode will enable commutation validation for Block.

    Returns
    -------
    InterpretationStep
        New InterpretationStep containing all modifications due to the logical pauli
        measurement.
