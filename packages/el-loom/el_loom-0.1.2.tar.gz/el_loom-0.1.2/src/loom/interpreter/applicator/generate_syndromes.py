    """
    Generate new Syndromes for the given stabilizers and its associated block.
    Stabilizers are passed explicitly as they follow the same order as the
    `stab_measurements` variable used to compute the Syndromes.

    CAUTION: This function pops the entries from the stabilizer_updates field of the
    interpretation step to compute corrections. This may cause issues in the future if
    the information in this field also needs to be accessed somewhere else.


    Parameters
    ----------
    interpretation_step : InterpretationStep
        The updated interpretation step implementing the operation
    stabilizers : tuple[Stabilizer, ...]
        Stabilizers that were measured, results are included in `stab_measurements`
    block : Block
        Block containing the stabilizers
    stab_measurements : tuple[tuple[Cbit, ...], ...]
        Measurements used to create the syndromes. Each index contains a tuple of Cbits
        associated to the stabilizer at the same index in `stabilizers`.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[Syndrome, ...]
        Syndromes created for the stabilizers, they are returned in the same order as
        the stabilizers are given.
