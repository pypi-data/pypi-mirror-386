    ------
    lattice : Lattice
        Lattice on which the Eka is defined
    blocks : tuple[Block, ...]
        Inital state of the block defining the logical qubits.
    operations : tuple[:class:`loom.eka.operations.base_operation.Operation`, ...] | tuple[tuple[:class:`loom.eka.operations.base_operation.Operation`, ...], ...]
        Operations to be executed on the block. Each tuple of operations is executed
        in parallel. The operations are executed in the order they are given in the
        tuple but their circuits are combined such that they can be executed in
        parallel. If the operations are specified as a tuple of operations, they are
        executed sequentially.
