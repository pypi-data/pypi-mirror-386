"""High-level federation bearer that provides cached, renewable tokens.

This module exposes :class:`FederationBearer`, a convenience bearer that
composes the interactive federation authorization implementation
(:class:`nebius.aio.token.federation_bearer.Bearer`) with the
asynchronous file-backed renewable cache
(:class:`nebius.aio.token.file_cache.async_renewable_bearer.AsynchronousRenewableFileCacheBearer`).

Behavior and authorization flow
-------------------------------

When a token is requested via :meth:`nebius.aio.token.token.Receiver.fetch` the
following sequence may occur:

1. The cache is consulted for a fresh token. If a cached token is valid it
   is returned immediately.
2. If renewal is required the underlying interactive flow is invoked. This
   flow is implemented by :class:`nebius.aio.token.federation_bearer.Receiver`
   and will typically:

     - construct an authorization URL and attempt to open the user's
       browser (unless ``no_browser_open`` is set), or return the URL so callers
       can display it.
     - block while waiting for the user to complete the authorization in the
       browser (for example by granting access). This means the fetch may hang
       until the user completes the flow.
     - receive an access token and expiration and return it to the caller.

Where the URL is shown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The interactive helper logs the authorization URL so it appears in the
  application's logs.
- If a ``writer`` stream is provided the helper will also write the URL and
  short instructions to that stream (e.g. ``stdout``), which is useful for
  headless environments.

Usage
-----

The :class:`FederationBearer` wraps the interactive bearer with a
file-backed renewable cache and exposes the usual :meth:`receiver` API::

    fb = FederationBearer(profile_name, client_id, endpoint, federation_id)
    token = await fb.receiver().fetch()

Note that because interactive authorization may block, callers should use
timeouts or call fetch from a background task when appropriate.

    :param profile_name: Human-readable profile name included in the bearer's
        :attr:`nebius.aio.token.token.Bearer.name` and used as part of the cache key.

    :param federation_id: Identifier of the federation configuration.
    :param writer: Optional text stream to which the interactive helper will
        write the authorization URL and short instructions.
    :param no_browser_open: When true the helper will not attempt to open a
        browser automatically and will instead rely on the provided ``writer``
        or logs to surface the URL to the user.
    :param timeout: Timeout forwarded to synchronous refresh requests.
    :param max_retries: Default maximum retry attempts for the receiver.
    :param initial_safety_margin: Safety margin used when deciding whether a
        cached token is considered too close to expiry. May be a timedelta or
        seconds value.
    :param retry_safety_margin: Safety margin subtracted when computing the
        initial retry interval for the background loop.
    :param lifetime_safe_fraction: Fraction of the token lifetime used to
        schedule proactive refreshes.
    :param initial_retry_timeout: Initial backoff timeout used after failures.
    :param max_retry_timeout: Maximum backoff timeout.
    :param retry_timeout_exponent: Exponent used for exponential backoff.
    :param file_cache_throttle: Throttle interval passed to the file cache
        layer to reduce disk reads.
    :param ssl_ctx: Optional SSL context used for HTTPS requests.
