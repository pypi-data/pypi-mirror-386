"""Federated bearer allowing interactive authorization flows.

This module provides a small bearer implementation that performs an
interactive federation-based authorization to obtain short-lived access
tokens. It is intended for scenarios where a user needs to authorize a
local client by opening a browser or presenting a URL to the user.

Interactive authorization flow (what happens on ``fetch``)
----------------------------------------------------------

When :meth:`Receiver._fetch` is invoked the implementation will call the
helper :func:`nebius.aio.token.federation_bearer.auth.authorize` which
performs the interactive federation handshake. The typical flow is:

1. The helper constructs an authorization URL and either attempts to open
     the user's default browser or returns the URL for the caller to display.
2. The helper will block while waiting for the user to complete the
     authorization in the browser (for example by granting access). This means
     ``Receiver._fetch`` may hang until the user completes the flow.
3. The helper receives an authorization response containing an access token
     and expiry. The receiver converts this into a
     :class:`nebius.aio.token.token.Token` and returns it to the caller.

Where the URL is shown
----------------------

- The authorization URL is logged at INFO/DEBUG levels so it appears in the project's
    logs.
- If a ``writer`` text stream is provided to the :class:`Receiver` or
    the :class:`Bearer`, the URL (and short instructions) will also be written
    to that stream so callers can present it directly to a user (for example
    printing to stdout).

Blocking considerations
-----------------------

Because the flow waits for the user's action, callers should be aware that
``fetch`` can block for an extended period. Use reasonable timeouts when
calling :meth:`Receiver._fetch` or invoke the bearer within a background
task if you need the application to remain responsive.

Classes
-------

- :class:`Receiver` -- A receiver that executes the interactive
    authorization flow and returns a :class:`nebius.aio.token.token.Token`.
- :class:`Bearer` -- A small bearer wrapper exposing the receiver and a
    canonical :attr:`Bearer.name` used for caching and logging.

Example
-------

Construct a bearer and fetch a token::

        bearer = Bearer(profile_name, client_id, endpoint, federation_id)
        token = await bearer.receiver().fetch()
