"""File-backed static token bearer.

This module provides a tiny bearer implementation that reads a raw
access token from a filesystem path. It is useful for local testing,
scripting or environments where a short-lived token is written to a
file by an external process or host system.

The behaviour is intentionally simple: every fetch reads the token
file contents and returns a :class:`Token`. Empty file contents raise
an :class:`nebius.base.error.SDKError`.

Examples
--------

Create a bearer that reads from ``~/.nebius/token``::

    from nebius.aio.token.file import Bearer
    bearer = Bearer("~/.nebius/token")
    token = await bearer.receiver().fetch()

Use in code that expects a :class:`nebius.aio.token.token.Bearer`::

    sdk = SDK(credentials=bearer)
