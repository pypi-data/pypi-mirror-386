"""Convenience bearer for federated credentials.

This module exposes :class:`FederatedCredentialsBearer`, a convenience
wrapper that composes the low-level federated credentials reader/token
requester implementations with the exchangeable and renewable bearers
to provide a ready-to-use bearer producing short-lived access tokens.

The class accepts one of several inputs for ``federated_credentials``:

- a
    :class:`nebius.base.service_account.federated_credentials.FederatedCredentialsBearer`
    (a reader-like object),
- a
    :class:`nebius.base.service_account.federated_credentials.FederatedCredentialsTokenRequester`
    (an object that can construct exchange requests), or
- a string path pointing to a file understood by
  :class:`nebius.base.service_account.federated_credentials.FileFederatedCredentials`.

The resulting bearer performs the token exchange via
:class:`nebius.aio.token.exchangeable.Bearer` and adds background
refresh via :class:`nebius.aio.token.renewable.Bearer`. When the
underlying credentials originate from a file the resulting bearer is
wrapped in a :class:`nebius.aio.token.token.NamedBearer` to provide a
stable diagnostic name.

Example
-------

Using a file path::

    from nebius.aio.token.federated_credentials import FederatedCredentialsBearer
    bearer = FederatedCredentialsBearer(
        "/path/to/fed-credentials.json",
        service_account_id="sa-123",
    )
    token = await bearer.receiver().fetch()

Using an existing reader/token requester::

    reader = SomeReader(...)
    bearer = FederatedCredentialsBearer(reader, service_account_id="sa-123")

    The class composes an :class:`ExchangeableBearer` (performs the
    token exchange) wrapped by :class:`RenewableBearer` (background
    refresh). It is a convenience wrapper for the common case where a
    consumer has federated credentials stored in a file or provided via
    a reader.

    If the federated credentials originate from a file, the resulting
    bearer is wrapped in a :class:`NamedBearer` to provide a stable cacheable name.

    Parameters are the same as for the underlying components and are
    passed through accordingly. See the examples in the module
    docstring for common usage patterns.

    :param federated_credentials: Either a reader, a token requester
        or a string path pointing to a file containing federated
        credentials. When a string is provided it is interpreted via
        :class:`FileFederatedCredentials`.
    :param service_account_id: Required when ``federated_credentials``
        is a reader or a string; identifies the target service account for the
        exchange.
    :param channel: Optional gRPC channel used for token exchange or
        a :class:`DeferredChannel` that resolves to a channel later.
    :param max_retries: Maximum per-request retry attempts.
    :param lifetime_safe_fraction: Fraction of token lifetime before
        triggering refresh.
    :param initial_retry_timeout: Initial retry backoff.
    :param max_retry_timeout: Maximum retry backoff.
    :param retry_timeout_exponent: Exponential backoff base.
    :param refresh_request_timeout: Timeout for a single refresh
        request.
