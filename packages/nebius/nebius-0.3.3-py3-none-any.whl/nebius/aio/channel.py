class Channel(ChannelBase):  # type: ignore[unused-ignore,misc]
    """A high-level gRPC channel manager used by the SDK.

    Responsibilities and behavior
    ==============================

    - Resolve service names to addresses and create underlying gRPC channels for
        those addresses.
    - Maintain a small pool of free channels per address to reuse connections and
        reduce churn (see ``max_free_channels_per_address`` init param).
    - Provide helpers to attach authorization credentials and manage token
        providers, including synchronous and asynchronous token acquisition via
        :meth:`get_token` and :meth:`get_token_sync`.
    - Expose convenience wrappers for unary-unary RPCs that ensure the address
        channel is returned to the pool when the RPC completes (see
        :class:`NebiusUnaryUnaryMultiCallable`).
    - Offer both async and sync usage models. Use the async context manager
        (``async with Channel(...)``) or call ``close()``/``sync_close()`` to
        gracefully shut down resources.

    Important notes
    ---------------

    - The channel owns a configurable asyncio event loop (optionally provided at
        construction). When calling ``run_sync`` from within an already running
        loop, a :class:`LoopError` is raised unless a separate loop was supplied at
        initialization.
    - The class cooperates with several SDK subsystems (token bearers,
        authorization providers, idempotency interceptor, and a resolver) and
        wires them together during initialization.
    - Public helper methods include: ``get_token``/``get_token_sync``,
        ``run_sync``, ``bg_task``, ``get_channel_by_method``, and
        ``create_address_channel``.

    Usage example
    =============

    Async usage (recommended)::

        async with Channel(...) as channel:
            # use channel or pass it to generated service clients
            pass

    Synchronous usage::

        channel = Channel(...)
        try:
            channel.run_sync(some_coroutine())
        finally:
            channel.sync_close()

    :ivar user_agent: The user-agent string used by channels created by
        this Channel instance.

    :param resolver:
        Optional custom :class:`Resolver` used to resolve service names to concrete
        addresses. If omitted a :class:`Conventional` resolver is used. If
        provided, it will be chained with the built-in resolver so both
        can be consulted.
    :type resolver: optional :class:`Resolver`

    :param substitutions:
        Optional mapping of template substitutions applied to resolved
        addresses. The construct inserts ``{"{domain}": domain}`` and
        then updates it with this mapping. Typical use is to override
        domain placeholders in generated service addresses.
    :type substitutions: optional dict[from, to]

    :param user_agent_prefix:
        Optional string prepended to the default SDK user-agent. The
        final user-agent string follows the pattern
        ``"<user_agent_prefix> nebius-python-sdk/<version> (python/X.Y.Z)"``.
        Recommended format:
        ``"my-app/1.0 (dependency-to-track/version; other-dependency)"``.
    :type user_agent_prefix: optional str

    :param domain:
        Optional domain to substitute into service addresses. When not
        provided the constructor will try to obtain it from the provided
        ``config_reader`` via ``config_reader.endpoint()``, and fall back
        to the package-level ``DOMAIN`` constant if still unset.
    :type domain: optional str

    :param options:
        Global channel options passed to gRPC when creating address
        channels. This should follow the ``ChannelArgumentType``
        shape (sequence of key/value tuples).
    :type options: optional list of tuple[str, Any]

    :param interceptors:
        Global list of gRPC :class:`ClientInterceptor`
        instances that will be applied to all address channels. An
        idempotency-key interceptor is added by default; pass a list to
        extend or override additional behavior.
    :type interceptors: optional list of :class:`ClientInterceptor`

    :param address_options:
        Optional mapping from a resolved address to per-address channel
        options. Each value must follow the ``ChannelArgumentType``
        shape (sequence of key/value tuples). If omitted
        an empty mapping is used.
    :type address_options: optional mapping address -> list of ``tuple[str, Any]``

    :param address_interceptors:
        Optional mapping from a resolved address to a sequence of
        per-address interceptors. Per-address interceptors are invoked
        in addition to the global interceptors.
    :type address_interceptors: optional mapping address ->
        Sequence[ClientInterceptor]

    :param credentials:
        Credentials can be provided in several forms:

        - ``None`` (default): attempts to read credentials from
            ``credentials_file_name``, then from provided service account
            fields, then from ``config_reader.get_credentials(...)``, and
            finally falls back to an environment-backed bearer
            (:class:`nebius.aio.token.static.EnvBearer`).
        - ``str`` or :class:`Token`: treated as a
            static token and wrapped with a static bearer.
        - :class:`TokenBearer` to use an existing token bearer as-is.
        - :class:`TokenRequester` to exchange tokens on demand.
        - :class:`AuthorizationProvider`: an explicit authorization provider
            (used rarely by advanced users).
        - :class:`NoCredentials`: disables authorization entirely.

        Unsupported types raise :class:`SDKError`.
    :type credentials: token in form of string or :class:`Token`, or classes
        :class:`TokenBearer`, :class:`TokenRequester`,
        :class:`AuthorizationProvider`, :class:`NoCredentials`

    :param service_account_id:
        Service account ID used when a private key file is supplied
        directly (alternate to using ``credentials_file_name``). See the
        README for examples. If ``credentials`` is provided explicitly
        this parameter is ignored.
    :type service_account_id: optional str

    :param service_account_public_key_id:
        Public key ID corresponding to the private key file used for
        service-account authentication, as described in the README. If
        ``credentials`` is provided explicitly this parameter is ignored.
    :type service_account_public_key_id: optional str

    :param service_account_private_key_file_name:
        Path to a PEM private key file. When provided with the key ID and service
        account ID fields above, the constructor wraps it in a service-account
        reader.
    :type service_account_private_key_file_name: optional str or :class:`Path`

    :param credentials_file_name:
        Path to a credentials JSON file containing service-account
        information. If supplied this takes precedence over other implicit
        credential discovery (unless ``credentials`` is explicitly
        provided).
    :type credentials_file_name: optional str or :class:`Path`

    :param config_reader:
        Optional :class:`nebius.aio.cli_config.Config` instance used to
        populate defaults like domain, default parent ID, and to obtain
        credentials via the CLI-style configuration.
    :type config_reader: optional :class:`ConfigReader`

    :param tls_credentials:
        Optional gRPC channel TLS credentials (:class:`ChannelCredentials`).
        If omitted the constructor will load system root certificates via
        :func:`nebius.base.tls_certificates.get_system_certificates` and
        create an SSL channel credentials object.
    :type tls_credentials: optional :class:`ChannelCredentials`

    :param event_loop:
        Optional asyncio event loop to be owned by this Channel. When a
        loop is provided, synchronous helpers such as :meth:`run_sync`
        may be called from other threads without raising
        :class:`LoopError`. If not provided the Channel will lazily
        create its own loop when a synchronous call is made.
    :type event_loop: optional :class:`AbstractEventLoop`

    :param max_free_channels_per_address:
        Number of free underlying gRPC channels to keep in the pool per
        resolved address. Defaults to 2. Lower values reduce resource
        usage but increase connection churn; larger values raise resource
        consumption.
    :type max_free_channels_per_address: optional int

    :param parent_id:
        Optional parent ID which will be automatically applied to many
        requests when left empty by the caller. If not provided and a
        ``config_reader`` is supplied the constructor will attempt to use
        ``config_reader.parent_id``. An explicit empty string is treated
        as an error.
    :type parent_id: optional str

    :param federation_invitation_writer:
        Optional file-like writer passed to the config reader to display
        the URL for federation authentication during interactive credential
        acquisition.
    :type federation_invitation_writer: optional :class:`TextIO`

    :param federation_invitation_no_browser_open:
        When using the config reader, set to ``True`` to avoid opening a web
        browser during interactive federation flows. Defaults to ``False``.
    :type federation_invitation_no_browser_open: optional bool

        Construct a new Channel instance.

        This constructor wires together the SDK's gRPC channel management,
        credential providers, resolvers, TLS configuration and interceptors.

        The Channel is responsible for resolving logical service names to
        transport addresses, creating and pooling underlying gRPC channels,
        and exposing helpers for synchronous and asynchronous usage.

        :raises SDKError:
            Raised for unsupported credential types or if ``parent_id`` is an
            explicitly empty string.

        Notes
        -----
        - The constructor performs several discovery steps for credentials in
          the following precedence order when ``credentials`` is ``None``:
          1. ``credentials_file_name`` reader
          2. service-account PEM reader (when id/key args are provided)
          3. ``config_reader.get_credentials(...)``
          4. environment-backed bearer (:class:`EnvBearer`)

        - Token readers are wrapped into exchangeable/renewable bearers so
          that token refresh happens transparently in the background and the
          Channel adds the bearer to its graceful shutdown set to ensure
          background tasks are cleaned up on :meth:`close`.

        Examples
        --------
        Typical, minimal construction that reads token from environment:

        >>> channel = Channel()

        Using explicit static token:

        >>> channel = Channel(credentials="MY_TOKEN")

        Creating channel from CLI config and a custom resolver:

        >>> from nebius.aio.cli_config import Config
        >>> channel = Channel(config_reader=Config(), resolver=my_resolver)
