# Nautobot App Livedata

<!--
Developer Note - Remove Me!

The README will have certain links/images broken until the PR is merged into `develop`. Update the GitHub links with whichever branch you're using (main etc.) if different.

The logo of the project is a placeholder (docs/images/icon-livedata.png) - please replace it with your app icon, making sure it's at least 200x200px and has a transparent background!

To avoid extra work and temporary links, make sure that publishing docs (or merging a PR) is done at the same time as setting up the docs site on RTD, then test everything.

## Overview

The [Nautobot App LiveData](https://github.com/jifox/nautobot-app-livedata/) is providing real-time data from network devices that are supported by [Netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko).

At the moment, the app is supporting only interface specific data. The data is collected from the devices via platform specific show commands and will be presented in the interface's 'Life Data' tab.

This app addresses the need for dynamic and up-to-date network information, allowing network administrators and engineers to make informed decisions based on the latest data.

## Support for Filter Commands in Live Device Output Using !! Syntax

### Filter Syntax

You can now append a filter command to the end of a device command using the `!!` delimiter. The string following `!!` specifies the filter operation to be applied to the command output.

#### Examples

- `show logging | i {{intf_number}} !!EXACT:{{intf_number}}!!` — Filters the output to contain only lines that contain the interface number as a whole word (e.g., matches ` Gi1/0/1`, `1/0/1  `, `^1/0/1 `, `1/0/1$` but not `11/0/1`, `1/0/11`, `foo1/0/1bar`).
- `show logging !!LAST:100!!` — Returns only the last 100 lines of the output.
- `show logging !!FIRST:10!!` — Returns only the first 10 lines of the output.
- `show logging !!EXACT:{{intf_number}}!!FIRST:5!!` — Filters for lines containing the interface number, then returns only the first 5 matching lines.

### Supported Filters
- `!!EXACT:<pattern>!!` — Only lines that contain `<pattern>` as a whole word (ignoring leading/trailing whitespace, not matching substrings within other numbers or words)
- `!!LAST:<N>!!` — Only the last N lines
- `!!FIRST:<N>!!` — Only the first N lines

Additional filters may be added in the future.

This feature provides a consistent filtering mechanism across all supported platforms, reducing the need for custom scripts or manual output parsing.
