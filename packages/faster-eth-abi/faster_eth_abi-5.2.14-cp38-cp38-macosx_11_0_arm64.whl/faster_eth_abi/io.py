    """
    A byte stream which can track a series of contextual frames in a stack. This
    data structure is necessary to perform nested decodings using the
    :py:class:``HeadTailDecoder`` since offsets present in head sections are
    relative only to a particular encoded object.  These offsets can only be
    used to locate a position in a decoding stream if they are paired with a
    contextual offset that establishes the position of the object in which they
    are found.

    For example, consider the encoding of a value for the following type::

        type: (int,(int,int[]))
        value: (1,(2,[3,3]))

    There are two tuples in this type: one inner and one outer.  The inner tuple
    type contains a dynamic type ``int[]`` and, therefore, is itself dynamic.
    This means that its value encoding will be placed in the tail section of the
    outer tuple's encoding.  Furthermore, the inner tuple's encoding will,
    itself, contain a tail section with the encoding for ``[3,3]``.  All
    together, the encoded value of ``(1,(2,[3,3]))`` would look like this (the
    data values are normally 32 bytes wide but have been truncated to remove the
    redundant zeros at the beginnings of their encodings)::

                       offset data
        --------------------------
             ^              0 0x01
             |             32 0x40 <-- Offset of object A in global frame (64)
        -----|--------------------
        Global frame ^     64 0x02 <-- Beginning of object A (64 w/offset 0 = 64)
             |       |     96 0x40 <-- Offset of object B in frame of object A (64)
        -----|-Object A's frame---
             |       |    128 0x02 <-- Beginning of object B (64 w/offset 64 = 128)
             |       |    160 0x03
             v       v    192 0x03
        --------------------------

    Note that the offset of object B is encoded as 64 which only specifies the
    beginning of its encoded value relative to the beginning of object A's
    encoding.  Globally, object B is located at offset 128.  In order to make
    sense out of object B's offset, it needs to be positioned in the context of
    its enclosing object's frame (object A).
