<!-- this is a file intended to be used only in tests - it is not placed in tests as we would have to have another
     python package registered during tests containing only this file - way overkill

     also, this file exists to overcome invneio bug in recursive import of header_login.html:

../.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/invenio_administration/templates/semantic-ui/invenio_theme/header_login.html:10: in top-level template code
    { % - extends "invenio_theme/header_login.html"  % }
../.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/invenio_administration/templates/semantic-ui/invenio_theme/header_login.html:10: in top-level template code
    { % - extends "invenio_theme/header_login.html"  % }

    When invenio fixes that, this file could be removed
