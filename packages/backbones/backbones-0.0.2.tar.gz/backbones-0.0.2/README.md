# Backbones

A library of backbone architectures for neural networks, standardized for easy
use in research and development.

This library was created to solve the following problems.

1. Reduce boilerplate that comes with (efficiently) extracting features from
    some pre-trained network.

2. Implement compatability layers to port weights between different distributors
    of pre-trained weights.

3. Allow both training and inference of the sub-networks.

## Alternatives

If you are looking for a more general-purpose library, consider using
[Torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html) or
[Timm](https://github.com/huggingface/timm). These libraries are geared towards
production, and are more feature-rich than this library.
