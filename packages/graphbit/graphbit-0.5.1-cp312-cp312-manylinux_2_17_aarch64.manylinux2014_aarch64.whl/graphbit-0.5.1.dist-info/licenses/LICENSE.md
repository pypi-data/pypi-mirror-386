## 4. Ownership of Outputs

You own your **Outputs**. However, Outputs, logs, artifacts, or derived model weights may **not** be used to train, fine-tune, or distill any **competing large language model** without an Enterprise License.

## 5. Responsible Use (Prohibited Uses)

You shall not use the framework or Outputs for:

* illegal activities;
* surveillance without lawful authority;
* military or autonomous weapon systems;
* disinformation;
* life-critical systems (including medical devices, aviation, nuclear) **without** an Enterprise License;

No rights are granted to use the Licensor’s names, logos, or trademarks beyond the attribution above. **This clause does not grant any right to distribute the framework.**

## 8. Termination

Licensor may terminate this License with one month’s notice to the end of the following month.
