# Nexus Core Tenets

This document defines the foundational principles that guide all design decisions in Nexus. When evaluating features, resolving tradeoffs, or reviewing contributions, these tenets serve as our north star.

**Inspired by:** [jj-vcs core tenets](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/docs/core_tenets.md), which showed us the value of explicit design principles.

## 1. Everything as a File

**Principle:** Configuration, memory, jobs, commands, and state are stored as files in the filesystem.

**Why:** Files are universal, version-controllable, human-readable, and tool-friendly. They enable:
- Zero-deployment extensibility (drop a markdown file → new command)
- Version control with external tools (Git, if desired)
- Inspection and editing with standard tools
- Natural integration with MCP and file-based tooling

**Examples:**
- ✅ Agent config: `/workspace/{agent}/.nexus/agent.yaml`
- ✅ Custom commands: `/workspace/{agent}/.nexus/commands/analyze.md`
- ✅ Agent memory: `/workspace/{agent}/.nexus/memory/knowledge.md`
- ✅ Jobs: `/workspace/{agent}/.nexus/jobs/daily-report.yaml`
- ❌ Database-only configuration (not human-readable, not version-controllable)
- ❌ Binary config formats (not editable with vim/vscode)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can this be represented as a file that humans can read/edit?
- Can this be version-controlled (externally, if user chooses)?
- Does this work with standard file tools (grep, find, diff)?

---

## 2. Agent-First Design

**Principle:** Optimize for AI agent workflows, not just human developers.

**Why:** Nexus is infrastructure for AI agents. Design decisions should prioritize:
- Easy programmatic access (SDK-first, then CLI)
- Semantic operations (semantic search, LLM-powered reads)
- Agent workspace isolation and safety
- Memory management and consolidation
- Debugging and observability of agent behavior

**Examples:**
- ✅ `nx.semantic_search()` - AI-native operation
- ✅ `nx.llm_read()` with KV cache - Optimize for AI usage patterns
- ✅ Agent workspace versioning - Time-travel debugging for agents
- ✅ Operation logs - "What did my agent do 10 steps ago?"
- ⚠️ Human-only features (e.g., fancy TUI) - Lower priority than agent features
- ❌ Sacrificing programmatic APIs for CLI convenience

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does this make agents more effective?
- Can an agent use this programmatically?
- Does this help debug agent behavior?
- Would this work in a multi-agent environment?

---

## 3. Zero-Deployment Option

**Principle:** Nexus must work as a library with zero deployment, like SQLite.

**Why:** Developers should be able to:
- `pip install nexus-ai-fs` and start coding immediately
- Run locally for development without servers
- Embed Nexus in applications without infrastructure
- Prototype agents on their laptop

**Examples:**
- ✅ `nx = nexus.connect()` works immediately with local backend
- ✅ SQLite metadata store (no PostgreSQL required locally)
- ✅ In-memory caching (no Redis required locally)
- ✅ Local filesystem backend (no S3 required locally)
- ❌ Requiring PostgreSQL for basic operations
- ❌ Requiring Redis for caching in local mode
- ❌ Requiring network calls for local operations

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can this work with SQLite + local filesystem?
- Does this require external services to function?
- Can a developer use this on their laptop without Docker?

---

## 4. Auto-Scaling Hosted Mode

**Principle:** Hosted mode infrastructure scales automatically from startup to enterprise. Users don't choose architecture—Nexus scales under the hood.

**Why:** Users should focus on building agents, not managing infrastructure. Nexus handles:
- Automatic migration from monolithic to distributed
- Infrastructure decisions based on usage patterns
- Seamless scaling without user intervention
- Single API across all deployment scales

**Examples:**
- ✅ Monolithic server → distributed cluster (automatic transition)
- ✅ Same API for 1 user and 10,000 users
- ✅ Automatic sharding/replication as needed
- ❌ Forcing users to choose "standard" vs "enterprise" architecture
- ❌ Different APIs for different scales
- ❌ Manual infrastructure provisioning

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does this work at both small and large scales?
- Can infrastructure scale without API changes?
- Are we hiding complexity from users?

---

## 5. Content-Addressable by Default

**Principle:** All content is stored using Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) with automatic deduplication.

**Why:** Eliminates storage waste, enables efficient versioning, and provides integrity guarantees:
- 30-50% storage savings through deduplication
- Zero-cost snapshots (same content = same hash)
- Automatic integrity verification
- Efficient version tracking

**Examples:**
- ✅ CAS-backed file storage (SHA-256 content hashing)
- ✅ Version control with zero duplication
- ✅ Workspace snapshots (reuse existing blobs)
- ✅ Training dataset deduplication
- ❌ Storing duplicate content
- ❌ Copy-on-write without CAS (wastes space)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is content deduplicated automatically?
- Can we reuse existing content blobs?
- Does versioning leverage CAS for efficiency?

---

## 6. Multi-Backend Abstraction

**Principle:** Abstract storage backends to support local, cloud, and specialized storage systems through a unified API.

**Why:** Users have diverse storage needs (local dev, S3 prod, GDrive collab). Nexus should:
- Provide a single API across all backends
- Allow mixing backends (hot/warm/cold tiers)
- Support pass-through backends (GDrive, SharePoint)
- Enable custom backends via plugins

**Examples:**
- ✅ LocalBackend, GCSBackend, S3Backend behind same interface
- ✅ Mount external storage as pass-through (no content storage)
- ✅ Tiered storage (hot = local, cold = S3 Glacier)
- ✅ Backend plugins for specialized storage
- ❌ Hardcoding S3-specific logic in core
- ❌ Different APIs for different backends

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does this work with all backends?
- Can we add new backends without changing core code?
- Is backend-specific logic isolated?

---

## 7. Human-Readable State

**Principle:** Agent-generated files should be human-readable (markdown, YAML, JSON), not binary blobs.

**Why:** Enables:
- Human inspection and understanding
- Manual editing when needed
- Meaningful diffs (with standard tools)
- Transparency in agent behavior
- Easy debugging

**Examples:**
- ✅ Agent memory in markdown with frontmatter
- ✅ Config in YAML
- ✅ Commands as markdown files
- ✅ Logs as JSON lines (JSONL)
- ⚠️ Binary formats only when necessary (embeddings, images)
- ❌ Pickle files for configuration
- ❌ Binary logs

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can a human read this file and understand it?
- Can we diff this meaningfully (with standard tools)?
- Can a human manually edit this if needed?

---

## 8. Version Everything

**Principle:** Files, configurations, memories, prompts, and workspaces are versioned by default.

**Why:** Enables:
- Time-travel debugging ("What state led to this bug?")
- Rollback of agent mistakes
- Audit trails
- Reproducibility
- Fearless experimentation

**Examples:**
- ✅ CAS-backed file versioning (automatic on every write)
- ✅ Workspace versioning (snapshot agent state)
- ✅ Prompt versioning with lineage tracking
- ✅ Memory versioning (track knowledge evolution)
- ✅ Operation logs (version control for operations)
- ❌ Destructive operations without undo
- ❌ Overwriting state without history

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can we undo this operation?
- Is history preserved?
- Can we time-travel to see past state?

---

## 9. Security by Default

**Principle:** Security features (encryption, ACLs, tenant isolation) are built-in, not bolted-on.

**Why:** AI agents handle sensitive data. Security must be:
- Multi-layered (API keys, RLS, type validation, UNIX permissions, ACLs, ReBAC)
- Enabled by default (secure by default)
- Hard to bypass accidentally
- Transparent to developers

**Examples:**
- ✅ Row-level security (RLS) for tenant isolation
- ✅ Permission enforcement enabled by default
- ✅ Type-level validation before database operations
- ✅ Multi-layer security (ReBAC → ACL → UNIX permissions)
- ✅ Encrypted secrets storage
- ❌ Security as optional configuration
- ❌ Trusting client-side validation alone
- ❌ Single-layer security (easy to bypass)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is this secure by default?
- Can we bypass security accidentally?
- Are multiple security layers in place?
- Is tenant data properly isolated?

---

## 10. MCP-Native

**Principle:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration is first-class, not an afterthought.

**Why:** MCP is the standard for AI tool integration. Nexus should:
- Expose native MCP server
- Work seamlessly with Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients
- Provide MCP-compatible file operations
- Enable agent tool discovery

**Examples:**
- ✅ Native MCP server implementation
- ✅ File operations exposed as MCP tools
- ✅ Semantic search via MCP
- ✅ Compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, etc.
- ❌ MCP as a wrapper around HTTP API
- ❌ Incompatible with MCP standards

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does this work with MCP clients?
- Can agents discover this via MCP?
- Is this compatible with MCP standards?

## Using These Tenets

### When Designing Features

Ask yourself:
1. Which tenets does this feature support?
2. Does it conflict with any tenets?
3. How can we align this with our principles?

### When Reviewing PRs

Check:
- Does this maintain "Everything as a File"?
- Is this agent-friendly?
- Does this work in local mode (zero-deployment)?
- Is security maintained?
- Is state human-readable?

### When Making Tradeoffs

Prioritize:
1. **Agent-First** over human convenience
2. **Security by Default** over ease of implementation
3. **Zero-Deployment** over features requiring infrastructure
4. **Human-Readable** over binary efficiency (unless perf-critical)

### Examples of Tenet-Driven Decisions

**Decision: Store agent config in YAML files, not database**
- ✅ Everything as a File
- ✅ Human-Readable State
- ✅ Version Everything (via Nexus CAS + optional external VCS)
- ✅ Zero-Deployment (no database schema migrations)

**Decision: CAS-backed file storage**
- ✅ Content-Addressable by Default
- ✅ Version Everything (zero-cost snapshots)
- ⚠️ Slightly more complex implementation (acceptable tradeoff)

**Decision: Permission enforcement enabled by default**
- ✅ Security by Default
- ✅ Agent-First (multi-agent safety)
- ⚠️ Slightly harder to debug locally (acceptable tradeoff)

**Decision: Support both local SQLite and hosted PostgreSQL**
- ✅ Zero-Deployment Option (SQLite)
- ✅ Auto-Scaling Hosted (PostgreSQL)
- ⚠️ More code to maintain (acceptable tradeoff)
