# ðŸ§° zwishh â€“ Internal SDK and Utilities

This package provides shared utilities and client SDKs for Zwishh's internal microservices.

It is intended for **internal use only** and should be used by trusted services inside the Zwishh platform infrastructure.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Included

### ðŸ”‘ Authentication & Security
- `verify_service_api_key_dep`: FastAPI dependency for verifying internal service API keys
- `get_current_user_id_dep`: Extracts and validates the current authenticated user from headers

### ðŸ§¬ SDK Clients
Clients for accessing core Zwishh services:

- `OrdersClient` â€“ create & fetch orders
- `CartClient` â€“ manage cart state
- `DeliveryClient` â€“ manage delivery state
- `CouponClient` â€“ manage coupon state
- `InteractionClient` â€“ manage interaction state
- `UserServiceClient` â€“ manage user state
- `SellerServiceClient` â€“ manage seller state


Each client:
- Uses async `httpx`
- Injects service-to-service API key headers
- Handles standard error responses
- Retries the request with exponential backoff
