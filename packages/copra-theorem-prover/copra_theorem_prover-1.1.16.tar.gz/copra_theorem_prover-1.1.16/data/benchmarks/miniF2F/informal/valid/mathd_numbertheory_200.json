{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_200", "informal_statement": "Tim is doing a cakewalk with $11$ steps. He takes his first step on step $1$ and takes a total of $139$ steps, walking in a circle (so that after the 11th step he reaches the first step again). Which step of the cakewalk does he end on? Show that it is 7.", "informal_proof": "When you divide $139$ steps by $11$ steps, you get $12$ with a remainder of $7$. Therefore, Tim lands on step $7$."}
