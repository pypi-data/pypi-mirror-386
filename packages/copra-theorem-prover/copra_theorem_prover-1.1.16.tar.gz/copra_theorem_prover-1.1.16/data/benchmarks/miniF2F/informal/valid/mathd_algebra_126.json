{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_126", "informal_statement": "The midpoint of the line segment between $(x,y)$ and $(-9,1)$ is $(3,-5)$. Find $(x,y)$. Show that it is (15,-11).", "informal_proof": "Applying the midpoint formula gives us $$\\left(\\frac{-9+x}{2},\\frac{1+y}{2}\\right)=(3,-5).$$Solving $\\frac{-9+x}{2} =3$ for $x$ and solving $\\frac{1+y}{2}=-5$ for $y$, we find the coordinates $(x,y)$ to be $(15,-11)$."}
