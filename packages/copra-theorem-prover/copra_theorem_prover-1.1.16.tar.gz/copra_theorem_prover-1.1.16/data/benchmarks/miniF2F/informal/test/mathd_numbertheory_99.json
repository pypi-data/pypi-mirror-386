{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_99", "informal_statement": "Solve the congruence $2n \\equiv 15 \\pmod{47}$, as a residue modulo 47.  (Give an answer between 0 and 46.) Show that it is 31.", "informal_proof": "Note that $15 \\equiv 62 \\pmod{47}$, so we can write the given congruence as $2n \\equiv 62 \\pmod{47}$.  Since 2 is relatively prime to 47, we can divide both sides by 2, to get $n \\equiv 31 \\pmod{47}$."}
