{"problem_name": "numbertheory_notequiv2i2jasqbsqdiv8", "informal_statement": "Let $a$ and $b$ be two integer numbers. Show that the following statement is false: $a$ and $b$ are both even iff $8 \\mid a^2 + b^2$.", "informal_proof": "We attempt the proof by contradiction: assuming the equivalence holds.\nInstantiating $a=2$ and $b=0$, we can see $a^2+b^2=4$ which is not divisible by $8$. Hence the equivalence cannot hold."}
