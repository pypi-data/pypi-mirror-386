{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_125", "informal_statement": "Today a father's age is five times his son's age. Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30. How old is the son today? Show that it is 6.", "informal_proof": "Let $x$ be the son's age today and his father's age $y$.  We know: $5x = y$, and that $(x -3) + (y -3) = 30$.  Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: $6x = 36$, and thus, $x=6$."}
