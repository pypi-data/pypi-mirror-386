{"problem_name": "algebra_ineq_nto1onlt2m1on", "informal_statement": "Let $n$ be a positive natural number. Show that $n^{1/n} \\leq 2 - 1/n$.", "informal_proof": "The result is trivially true for $n=1,2,3$.\nLet us define $f : x \\longrightarrow x^{\\frac{1}{x}}+x$. We have that $f$ is defined on $[3, \\infty[$ and that $f'(x) = x^{\\frac{1}{x}} \\frac{1-\\ln(x)}{x^2} - \\frac{1}{x^2}$. For $x \\geq 3$, we have that $1-\\ln{x} < 0$ so $f'(x) < 0$. So $f$ is decreasing on $[3, \\infty[$. But $f(3) \\leq 2$. As a result, $\\forall x \\geq 3, f(x) \\leq 2$. This is in particular true for all $n \\geq 3$. $n^{1/n} \\leq 2 - 1/n$ being satisfied for $n=1,2,3$, we have that $n^{1/n} \\leq 2 - 1/n$ for any natural number $n$."}
