{"problem_name": "imo_1959_p1", "informal_statement": "Prove that the fraction $\\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}$ is irreducible for every natural number $n$.", "informal_proof": "Denoting the greatest common divisor of $a, b $ as $(a,b) $, we use the [[Euclidean algorithm]]:\n\n$(21n+4, 14n+3) = (7n+1, 14n+3) = (7n+1, 1) = 1$\n\nIt follows that $\\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}$ is irreducible.
