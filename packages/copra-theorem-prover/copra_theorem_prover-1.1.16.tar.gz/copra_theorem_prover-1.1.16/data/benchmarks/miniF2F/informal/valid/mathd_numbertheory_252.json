{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_252", "informal_statement": "What is the remainder when $7!$ is divided by $23$?\n\n(Note: $n!$ means \"n factorial\", defined as the product of all integers from $1$ to $n$.) Show that it is 3.", "informal_proof": "$7!$ is defined as $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5\\cdot 6\\cdot 7$.\n\nNote that $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 = 24 \\equiv 1\\pmod{23}$. So, $$7! \\equiv 1\\cdot 5\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\pmod{23}.$$Furthermore, we have $1\\cdot 5\\cdot 6 = 30\\equiv 7 \\pmod{23}$, so \\begin{align*}\n7! &\\equiv 7\\cdot 7 \\\\\n&= 49 \\\\\n&\\equiv 3 \\pmod{23}.\n\\end{align*}The remainder is $3$."}
