{"problem_name": "amc12a_2002_p12", "informal_statement": "Both roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 63x + k = 0$ are prime numbers. The number of possible values of $k$ is \n\n$\\text{(A)}\\ 0 \\qquad \\text{(B)}\\ 1 \\qquad \\text{(C)}\\ 2 \\qquad \\text{(D)}\\ 4 \\qquad \\text{(E) more than 4}$ Show that it is \\text{(B)}\\ 1.", "informal_proof": "Consider a general quadratic with the coefficient of $x^2$ being $1$ and the roots being $r$ and $s$. It can be factored as $(x-r)(x-s)$ which is just $x^2-(r+s)x+rs$. Thus, the sum of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of $x$ and the product is the constant term. (In general, this leads to [[Vieta's Formulas]]).\n\nWe now have that the sum of the two roots is $63$ while the product is $k$. Since both roots are primes, one must be $2$, otherwise the sum would be even. That means the other root is $61$ and the product must be $122$. Hence, our answer is $\\text{(B)}\\ 1$."}
