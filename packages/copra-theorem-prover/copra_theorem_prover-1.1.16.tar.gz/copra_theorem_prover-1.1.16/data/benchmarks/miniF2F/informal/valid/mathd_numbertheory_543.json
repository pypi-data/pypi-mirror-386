{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_543", "informal_statement": "Find the number of distinct positive divisors of $(30)^4$ excluding 1 and $(30)^4$. Show that it is 123.", "informal_proof": "$$ (30^4) = (2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1)^4 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^4 $$Since $t(30^4) = (4+1)^3 = 125$, taking out 1 and $(30^4)$ leaves $125 - 2 = 123$ positive divisors."}
