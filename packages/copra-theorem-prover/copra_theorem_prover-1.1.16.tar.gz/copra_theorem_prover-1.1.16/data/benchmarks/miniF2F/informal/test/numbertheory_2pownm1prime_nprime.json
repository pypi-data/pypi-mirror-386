{"problem_name": "numbertheory_2pownm1prime_nprime", "informal_statement": "Show that if $n$ is a positive integer and $2^n - 1$ is prime, then $n$ is prime.", "informal_proof": "Let's assume that $n$ is not prime, and that there exists two integers $p$ and $q$ such that $p \\geq 2, q \\geq 2$ and $n = pq$. We have:\n$$2^n - 1 = 2^{pq} - 1 = (2^p)^q - 1 = (2^p - 1) \\times \\left((2^p)^{q-1} + \\dots + 2^p + 1\\right)$$\nSo, $2^p - 1$ is a divisor of $2^n - 1$. Since $2^p - 1 \\geq 2$, this contradicts the initial assumption which is that $n$ is not prime. Hence, $n$ is a prime number."}
