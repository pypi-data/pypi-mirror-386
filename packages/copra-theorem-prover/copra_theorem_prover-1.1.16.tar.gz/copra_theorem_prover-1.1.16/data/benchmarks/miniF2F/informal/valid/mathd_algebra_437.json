{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_437", "informal_statement": "Find the integer that lies between $\\sqrt[3]{-45}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{-101}$. Show that it is -4.", "informal_proof": "We have $(-3)^3 = -27$, $(-4)^3 = -64$, and $(-5)^3 = -125$.  Since $-64$ is between $-45$ and $-101$, we know that $\\sqrt[3]{-64}$, which equals $-4$, is between $\\sqrt[3]{-45}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{-101}$."}
