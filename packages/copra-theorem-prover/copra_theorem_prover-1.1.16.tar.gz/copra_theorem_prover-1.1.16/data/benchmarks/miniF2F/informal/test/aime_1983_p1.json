{"problem_name": "aime_1983_p1", "informal_statement": "Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ all exceed $1$ and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\\log_x w = 24$, $\\log_y w = 40$ and $\\log_{xyz} w = 12$. Find $\\log_z w$. Show that it is 060.", "informal_proof": "The [[logarithm]]ic notation doesn't tell us much, so we'll first convert everything to the equivalent exponential forms.\n\n$x^{24}=w$, $y^{40}=w$, and $(xyz)^{12}=w$. If we now convert everything to a power of $120$, it will be easy to isolate $z$ and $w$.\n\n$x^{120}=w^5$, $y^{120}=w^3$, and $(xyz)^{120}=w^{10}$.\n\nWith some substitution, we get $w^5w^3z^{120}=w^{10}$ and $\\log_zw=060$."}
