{"problem_name": "amc12b_2021_p21", "informal_statement": "Let $S$ be the sum of all positive real numbers $x$ for which$x^{2^{\\sqrt2}}=\\sqrt2^{2^x}.$Which of the following statements is true?\n\n$\\textbf{(A) }S<\\sqrt2 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) }S=\\sqrt2 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) }\\sqrt2<S<2\\qquad \\textbf{(D) }2\\le S<6 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) }S\\ge 6$ Show that it is \\textbf{(D) }2\\le S<6.", "informal_proof": "Note that\n$\\begin{align*}\nx^{2^{\\sqrt{2}}} &= {\\sqrt{2}}^{2^x} \\\\\n2^{\\sqrt{2}} \\log_2 x &= 2^{x} \\log_2 \\sqrt{2}.\n\\end{align*}$\n(At this point we see by inspection that $x=\\sqrt{2}$ is a solution.)\n\nWe simplify the RHS, then take the base-$2$ logarithm for both sides:\n$\\begin{align*}\n2^{\\sqrt{2}} \\log_2 x &= 2^{x-1} \\\\\n\\log_2{\\left(2^{\\sqrt{2}} \\log_2 x\\right)} &= x-1 \\\\\n\\sqrt{2} + \\log_2 \\log_2 x &= x-1 \\\\\n\\log_2 \\log_2 x &= x - 1 - \\sqrt{2}.\n\\end{align*}$\nThe RHS is a line; the LHS is a concave curve that looks like a logarithm and has $x$ intercept at $(2,0).$\n\nThere are at most two solutions, one of which is $\\sqrt{2}.$ But note that at $x=2,$ we have $\\log_2 \\log_2 {2} = 0 > 2 - 1 - \\sqrt{2},$ meaning that the log log curve is above the line, so it must intersect the line again at a point $x > 2.$ Now we check $x=4$ and see that $\\log_2 \\log_2 {4} = 1 < 4 - 1 - \\sqrt{2},$ which means at $x=4$ the line is already above the log log curve. Thus, the second solution lies in the interval $(2,4).$\nThe answer is $\\textbf{(D) }2\\le S<6.$"}
