{"problem_name": "aime_1991_p1", "informal_statement": "Find $x^2+y^2_{}$ if $x_{}^{}$ and $y_{}^{}$ are positive integers such that\n$\\begin{align*}\nxy+x+y&=71, \\\\\nx^2y+xy^2&=880.\n\\end{align*}$ Show that it is 146.", "informal_proof": "Define $a = x + y$ and $b = xy$. Then $a + b = 71$ and $ab = 880$. Solving these two equations yields a [[quadratic equation|quadratic]]: $a^2 - 71a + 880 = 0$, which [[factor]]s to $(a - 16)(a - 55) = 0$. Either $a = 16$ and $b = 55$ or $a = 55$ and $b = 16$. For the first case, it is easy to see that $(x,y)$ can be $(5,11)$ (or vice versa). In the second case, since all factors of $16$ must be $\\le 16$, no two factors of $16$ can sum greater than $32$, and so there are no integral solutions for $(x,y)$. The solution is $5^2 + 11^2 = 146$."}
