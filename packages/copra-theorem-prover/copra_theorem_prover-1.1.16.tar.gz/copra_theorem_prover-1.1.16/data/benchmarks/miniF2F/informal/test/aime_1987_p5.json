{"problem_name": "aime_1987_p5", "informal_statement": "Find $3x^2 y^2$ if $x$ and $y$ are [[integer]]s such that $y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517$. Show that it is 588.", "informal_proof": "If we move the $x^2$ term to the left side, it is [[SFFT|factorable]]:\n\n$(3x^2 + 1)(y^2 - 10) = 517 - 10$\n\n$507$ is equal to $3 \\cdot 13^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $3x^2 + 1$ cannot equal a multiple of three. $169$ doesn't work either, so $3x^2 + 1 = 13$, and $x^2 = 4$. This leaves $y^2 - 10 = 39$, so $y^2 = 49$. Thus, $3x^2 y^2 = 3 \\times 4 \\times 49 = 588$."}
