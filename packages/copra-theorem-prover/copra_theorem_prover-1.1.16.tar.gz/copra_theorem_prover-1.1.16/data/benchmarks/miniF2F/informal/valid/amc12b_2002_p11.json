{"problem_name": "amc12b_2002_p11", "informal_statement": "The positive integers $A, B, A-B, $ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers. The sum of these four primes is\n\n$\\mathrm{(A)}\\ \\mathrm{even}\n\\qquad\\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\mathrm{divisible\\ by\\ }3\n\\qquad\\mathrm{(C)}\\ \\mathrm{divisible\\ by\\ }5\n\\qquad\\mathrm{(D)}\\ \\mathrm{divisible\\ by\\ }7\n\\qquad\\mathrm{(E)}\\ \\mathrm{prime}$ Show that it is \\mathrm{(E)}\\ \\text{prime}.", "informal_proof": "Since $A-B$ and $A+B$ must have the same [[parity]], and since there is only one even prime number, it follows that $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd. Thus one of $A, B$ is odd and the other even. Since $A+B > A > A-B > 2$, it follows that $A$ (as a prime greater than $2$) is odd. Thus $B = 2$, and $A-2, A, A+2$ are consecutive odd primes. At least one of $A-2, A, A+2$ is divisible by $3$, from which it follows that $A-2 = 3$ and $A = 5$. The sum of these numbers is thus $17$, a prime, so the answer is $\\mathrm{(E)}\\ \\text{prime}$."}
