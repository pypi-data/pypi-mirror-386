{"problem_name": "algebra_9onxpypzleqsum2onxpy", "informal_statement": "Show that for any three positive real numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$, $9/(x+y+z)\\leq 2/(x+y)+2/(y+z)+2/(z+x)$.", "informal_proof": "Because $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive, so is $x+y+z$.\nTherefore it suffices to prove $9/(x+y+z) * (2x+2y+2z) \\leq (2/(x+y)+2/(y+z)+2/(z+x)) * (2x+2y+2z)$.\nWe see that the left hand side can be simplified to $18$.\nThe right hand side satisfies $(2/(x+y)+2/(y+z)+2/(z+x)) * (2x+2y+2z) = (2/(x+y)+2/(y+z)+2/(z+x)) * ((x+y) + (y+z) + (z+x)) \\ge (\\sqrt{2/x+y}\\sqrt{x+y} + \\sqrt{2/y+z}\\sqrt{y+z} + \\sqrt{2/x+z}\\sqrt{x+z})^2 = (3\\sqrt{2})^2 = 18$. Hence the inequality holds."}
