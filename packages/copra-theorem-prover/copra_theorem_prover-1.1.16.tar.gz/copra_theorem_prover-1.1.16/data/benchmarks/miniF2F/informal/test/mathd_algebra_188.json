{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_188", "informal_statement": "Suppose $f(x)$ is an invertible function, and suppose that $f(2)=f^{-1}(2)=4$.\n\nWhat is the value of $f(f(2))$? Show that it is 2.", "informal_proof": "Since $f(2)=f^{-1}(2)$, we can substitute $f^{-1}(2)$ freely for $f(2)$. Therefore, $f(f(2)) = f(f^{-1}(2))$, which is $2$ (since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ by definition).\n\nNotice that we didn't actually need the value $4$ given in the problem."}
