{"problem_name": "algebra_others_exirrpowirrrat", "informal_statement": "Show that there exist real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a$ is irrational, $b$ is irrational, and $a^b$ is rational.", "informal_proof": "We know that $\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number.\nIf $\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}$ is rational, we found a solution.\nOtherwise, we consider $a=\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $b=\\sqrt{2}$.\nThen, we have $a^b=(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}})^{\\sqrt{2}}=\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}\\times\\sqrt{2}}=\\sqrt{2}^2=2$ so $a^b$ is rational, and we found a solution."}
