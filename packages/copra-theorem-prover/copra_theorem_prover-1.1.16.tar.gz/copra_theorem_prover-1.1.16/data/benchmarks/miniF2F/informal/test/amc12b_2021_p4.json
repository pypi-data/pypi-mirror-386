{"problem_name": "amc12b_2021_p4", "informal_statement": "Ms. Blackwell gives an exam to two classes. The mean of the scores of the students in the morning class is $84$, and the afternoon class's mean score is $70$. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is $\\frac{3}{4}$. What is the mean of the scores of all the students?\n\n$\\textbf{(A)} ~74 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)} ~75 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)} ~76 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)} ~77 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)} Show that it is \\textbf{(C)} ~76.", "informal_proof": "Let there be $3x$ students in the morning class and $4x$ students in the afternoon class. The total number of students is $3x + 4x = 7x$. The average is $\\frac{3x\\cdot84 + 4x\\cdot70}{7x}=76$. Therefore, the answer is $\\textbf{(C)} ~76$."}
