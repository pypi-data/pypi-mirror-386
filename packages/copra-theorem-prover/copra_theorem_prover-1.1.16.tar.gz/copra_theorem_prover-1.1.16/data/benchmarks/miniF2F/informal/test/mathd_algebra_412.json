{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_412", "informal_statement": "The sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 11. What is the larger of the two numbers? Show that it is 18.", "informal_proof": "Let $x,y$ be the two numbers, $x>y$. Then $x+y=25$ and $x-y=11$, thus:\n\n$x=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((x+y)+(x-y)\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}(25+11)=18$."}
