{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_398", "informal_statement": "On planet Larky, 7 ligs = 4 lags, and 9 lags = 20 lugs. How many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs? Show that it is 63.", "informal_proof": "Multiply the second equation by 4 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 80 lugs.  Then multiply the first equation by 9 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 63 ligs.  Since each is equivalent to 36 lags, 80 lugs and $63$ ligs are equivalent."}
