{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_136", "informal_statement": "When 39,500 is divided by an integer $n$, the quotient is 123 and the remainder is 17. Find $n$. Show that it is 321.", "informal_proof": "Turning our sentence into math we have \\[39500=123n+17\\]and we want to solve for $n$.  That gives  \\[n=\\frac{39500-17}{123}=\\frac{39483}{123}=321.\\]"}
