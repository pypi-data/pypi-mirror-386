{"problem_name": "aime_1996_p5", "informal_statement": "Suppose that the [[root]]s of $x^3+3x^2+4x-11=0$ are $a$, $b$, and $c$, and that the roots of $x^3+rx^2+sx+t=0$ are $a+b$, $b+c$, and $c+a$. Find $t$. Show that it is 23.", "informal_proof": "By [[Vieta's formulas]] on the polynomial $P(x) = x^3+3x^2+4x-11 = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = 0$, we have $a + b + c = s = -3$, $ab + bc + ca = 4$, and $abc = 11$. Then\n<center>$t = -(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = -(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) = -(-3-a)(-3-b)(-3-c)$</center>\nThis is just the definition for $-P(-3) = 023$."}
