{"problem_name": "induction_sum_1oktkp1", "informal_statement": "Show that for positive integer $n$, $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)} = \\frac{n}{n+1}$.", "informal_proof": "We show the result by induction. The result is trivial for $n=1$. Let us assume the result holds for $n \\geq 1$. Then, we have $\\sum_{k=0}^{(n+1)-1} \\frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)} = \\frac{n}{n+1} + \\frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)} = \\frac{n(n+2)+1}{(n+1)(n+2)} = \\frac{n^2+2n+1}{(n+1)(n+2)} = \\frac{(n+1)^2}{(n+1)(n+2)} = \\frac{n+1}{n+2}$. So the result holds for $n+1$, and by induction it is true for every positive integer $n$."}
