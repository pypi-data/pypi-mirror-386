{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_237", "informal_statement": "What is the modulo $6$ remainder of the sum $1+2+3+4+\\dots+98+99+100?$ Show that it is 4.", "informal_proof": "Instead of adding up the sum and finding the residue, we can find the residue of each number to make computation easier.\n\nEach group of 6 numbers would have the sum of residues $1+2+3+4+5+0 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 3 \\pmod6$.\n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{6}\\right\\rfloor=16$ sets of $6$ numbers. This leaves the numbers $97,98,99,$ and $100$, which have the residues $1,2,3,$ and $4$. Adding together all the residues, we have $3 \\cdot 16 + 1+2+3+4 \\equiv 58 \\equiv 4 \\pmod6$."}
