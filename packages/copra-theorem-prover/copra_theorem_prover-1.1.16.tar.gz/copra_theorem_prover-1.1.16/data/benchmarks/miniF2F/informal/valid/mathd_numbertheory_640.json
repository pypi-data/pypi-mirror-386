{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_640", "informal_statement": "Find the remainder when $91145 + 91146 + 91147 + 91148$ is divided by 4. Show that it is 2.", "informal_proof": "For any four consecutive integers, their residues modulo 4 are 0, 1, 2, and 3 in some order, so their sum modulo 4 is $0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$."}
