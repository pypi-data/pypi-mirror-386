{"problem_name": "amc12a_2021_p9", "informal_statement": "Which of the following is equivalent to\n$(2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})?$\n$\\textbf{(A)} ~3^{127} + 2^{127} \\qquad\\textbf{(B)} ~3^{127} + 2^{127} + 2 \\cdot 3^{63} + 3 \\cdot 2^{63} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)} ~3^{128}-2^{128} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)} ~3^{128} + 2^{128} \\qquad\\textbf{(E)} Show that it is \\textbf{(C)} ~3^{128}-2^{128}.", "informal_proof": "By multiplying the entire equation by $3-2=1$, all the terms will simplify by difference of squares, and the final answer is $\\textbf{(C)} ~3^{128}-2^{128}$.\n\nAdditionally, we could also multiply the entire equation (we can let it be equal to $x$) by $2-3=-1$. The terms again simplify by difference of squares. This time, we get $-x=2^{128}-3^{128} \\Rightarrow x=3^{128}-2^{128}$. Both solutions yield the same answer."}
