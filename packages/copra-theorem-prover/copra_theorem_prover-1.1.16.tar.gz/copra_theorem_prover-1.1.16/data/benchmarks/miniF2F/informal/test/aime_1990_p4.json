{"problem_name": "aime_1990_p4", "informal_statement": "Find the positive solution to\n<center>$\\frac 1{x^2-10x-29}+\\frac1{x^2-10x-45}-\\frac 2{x^2-10x-69}=0$</center> Show that it is 013.", "informal_proof": "We could clear out the denominators by multiplying, though that would be unnecessarily tedious.\n\nTo simplify the equation, substitute $a = x^2 - 10x - 29$ (the denominator of the first fraction). We can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{a - 16} - \\frac{2}{a - 40} = 0$. Multiplying out the denominators now, we get:\n\n$(a - 16)(a - 40) + a(a - 40) - 2(a)(a - 16) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, $-64a + 40 \\times 16 = 0$, so $a = 10$. Re-substituting, $10 = x^2 - 10x - 29 \\Longleftrightarrow 0 = (x - 13)(x + 3)$. The positive [[root]] is $013$."}
