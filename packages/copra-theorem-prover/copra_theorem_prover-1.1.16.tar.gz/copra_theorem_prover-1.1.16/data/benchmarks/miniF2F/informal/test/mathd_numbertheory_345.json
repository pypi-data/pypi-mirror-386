{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_345", "informal_statement": "What is the remainder when $2000+2001+2002+2003+2004+2005+2006$ is divided by $7$? Show that it is 0.", "informal_proof": "Since $2000,2001,\\ldots,2006$ are $7$ consecutive integers, they include exactly one integer from each residue class $\\pmod 7$. Therefore, their sum is congruent $\\pmod 7$ to $0+1+2+3+4+5+6=21$. The remainder of this sum $\\pmod 7$ is $0$."}
