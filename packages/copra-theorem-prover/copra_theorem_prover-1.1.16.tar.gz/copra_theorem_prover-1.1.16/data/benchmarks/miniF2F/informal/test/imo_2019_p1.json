{"problem_name": "imo_2019_p1", "informal_statement": "'Let $\\mathbb{Z}$ be the set of integers. Determine all functions $f : \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ such that, for all\n''integers $a$ and $b$, $f(2a) + 2f(b) = f(f(a + b)).$''", "informal_proof": "Let us substitute $0$ in for $a$ to get\n$f(0) + 2f(b) = f(f(b)).$\n\nNow, since the domain and range of $f$ are the same, we can let $x = f(b)$ and $f(0)$ equal some constant $c$ to get\n$c + 2x = f(x).$\nTherefore, we have found that '''all''' solutions must be of the form $f(x) = 2x + c.$\n\nPlugging back into the original equation, we have: $4a + c + 4b + 2c = 4a + 4b + 2c + c$ which is true. Therefore, we know that $f(x) = 2x + c$ satisfies the above for any '''integral''' constant c, and that this family of equations is unique."}
