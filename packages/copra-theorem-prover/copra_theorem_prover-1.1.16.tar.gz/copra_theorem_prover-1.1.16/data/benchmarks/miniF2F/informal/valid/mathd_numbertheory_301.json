{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_301", "informal_statement": "If $j$ is a positive integer and the expression $(7j+3)$ is multiplied by 3 and then divided by 7, what is the remainder? Show that it is 2.", "informal_proof": "First we multiply $(7j+3)$ by 3 to get $21j+9$. Now we divide by 7 and get $$\\frac{21j+9}{7}=3j+\\frac{9}{7}=3j+1+\\frac{2}{7}.$$ Since $j$ is an integer, we know that $3j+1$ is also an integer. We're left with the fraction $\\frac{2}{7}$ when we divided by 7, which means the remainder is $2$."}
