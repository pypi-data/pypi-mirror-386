{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_359", "informal_statement": "What is the value of $y$ in the arithmetic sequence $y + 6$, $12$, $y$? Show that it is 9.", "informal_proof": "The difference between the second and first term is $12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$, and the difference between the third and second term is $y - 12$.  These must be equal, so $6 - y = y - 12$.  Solving for $y$, we find $y = 9$."}
