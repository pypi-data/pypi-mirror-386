{"problem_name": "amc12b_2002_p3", "informal_statement": "For how many positive integers $n$ is $n^2 - 3n + 2$ a [[prime]] number?\n\n$\\mathrm{(A)}\\ \\text{none}\n\\qquad\\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one}\n\\qquad\\mathrm{(C)}\\ \\text{two}\n\\qquad\\mathrm{(D)}\\ \\text{more\\ than\\ two,\\ but\\ finitely\\ many}\n\\qquad\\mathrm{(E)}\\ \\text{infinitely\\ many}$ Show that it is \\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one}.", "informal_proof": "Factoring, we get $n^2 - 3n + 2 = (n-2)(n-1)$. Either $n-1$ or $n-2$ is odd, and the other is even.  Their product must yield an even number.  The only prime that is even is $2$, which is when $n$ is $3$ or $0$. Since $0$ is not a positive number, the answer is $\\mathrm{(B)}\\ \\text{one}$."}
