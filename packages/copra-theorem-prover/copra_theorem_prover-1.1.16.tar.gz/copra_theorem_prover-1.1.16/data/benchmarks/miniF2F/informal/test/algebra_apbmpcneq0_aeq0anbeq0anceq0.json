{"problem_name": "algebra_apbmpcneq0_aeq0anbeq0anceq0", "informal_statement": "Assume that $m$ and $n$ are both positive reals, $m^3 = 2$, $n^3 = 4$, and $a + bm + cn = 0$ for rational numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nShow that $a = b = c = 0$.", "informal_proof": "We have that $m = 2^{1/3}$ and $n=2^{2/3}=m^2$ so $a+bm+cm^2=0$.\n\nLet us suppose that $ab \\ne 0$ and $c=0$. Then $a+bm=0$ so $m$ is rational and there exists $p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $q \\neq 0$ and $m=\\frac{p}{q}$ and $gcd(p, q)=1$.\nSo $m^3=2=\\frac{p^3}{q^3}$ and $2q^3=p^3$. So $2 \\mid p$. Since $2 \\mid p$, $8 \\mid p^3 = 2q^3$ and $4 \\mid q^3$. Necessarily, $q \\mid 2$ which is absurd because $gcd(p, q)=1$, so $m$ is irrational and if $ab \\ne 0$, then $c \\ne 0$.\n\nSo if $ab \\ne 0$, then $c \\ne 0$. Dividing $a+bm+cm^2=0$ by $c$ we can assume that $c=1$ without loss of generality, so $m^2+bm+c=0$.\nMultiplying by $m$, we get $2+bm^2+2m=0$, but $m^2=-c-bm$ so $2+b(-c-bm)+2m=0$ and $2-bc-b^2m+2m=(2-bc)+m(2-b^2)=0$. So either $2-bc=2-b^2=0$ or $m$ is rational. As seen above, $m$ is irrational so $b^2=2$, but $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational which is absurd, so $ab=0$.\n\nSince $ab=0$, and using the fact that $m$ is irrational, we have that necessarily $a=b=c=0$."}
