{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_12", "informal_statement": "How many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20? Show that it is 4.", "informal_proof": "For integers divisible by 20, we look for multiples of 20. The least and greatest multiples of 20 between 15 and 85 are 20 and 80, respectively. Between those two multiples of 20 are 40 and 60. So there are $4$ multiples of 20 between 15 and 85."}
