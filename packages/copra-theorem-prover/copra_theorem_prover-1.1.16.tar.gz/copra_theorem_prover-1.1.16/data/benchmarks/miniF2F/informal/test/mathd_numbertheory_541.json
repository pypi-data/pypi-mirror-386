{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_541", "informal_statement": "The product of two positive whole numbers is 2005. If neither number is 1, what is the sum of the two numbers? Show that it is 406.", "informal_proof": "$2005=5\\cdot401$. Checking the primes less than $\\sqrt{401}$ as potential divisors, we see that 401 is prime. Thus, the positive whole numbers in question are 5 and 401. Their sum is $406.$"}
