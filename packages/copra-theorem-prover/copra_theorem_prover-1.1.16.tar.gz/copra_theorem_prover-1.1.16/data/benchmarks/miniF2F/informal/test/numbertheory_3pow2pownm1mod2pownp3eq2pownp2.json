{"problem_name": "numbertheory_3pow2pownm1mod2pownp3eq2pownp2", "informal_statement": "Show that for positive integer $n$, the remainder of $3^{2^n} - 1 \\equiv 2^{n+2} \\mod 2^{n+3}$.", "informal_proof": "We can prove this by induction on n. For the base case, $n=1$, when the result obviously holds.\nFor the inductive case, the hypothesis is $3^{2^n} - 1 \\equiv 2^{n+2} \\mod 2^{n+3}$, so we can obtain a natural number $p$ where $3^{2^n} - 1 = 2^{n+2} + p * 2^{n+3} = 2^{n+2}(1+2p)$.\nThen we have $3^{2^{n+1}} = 3^{2^n*2} = (3^{2^n})^2 = (2^{n+2} * (1+2p) + 1)^2$.\nHence $3^{2^{n+1}} \\equiv (2^{n+2} * (1+2p))^2 + 2 * 2^{n+2} * (1+2p) + 1 \\equiv 2^{n+3}*(1+2p) + 1 \\equiv 1\\mod 2^{n+3}$.\nTherefore $3^{2^{n+1}} -1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 2^{n+3}$. By induction, the statement holds true."}
