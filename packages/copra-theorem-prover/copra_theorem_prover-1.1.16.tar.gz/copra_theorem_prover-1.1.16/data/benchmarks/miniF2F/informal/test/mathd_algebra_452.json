{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_452", "informal_statement": "The first and ninth terms of an arithmetic sequence are $\\frac23$ and $\\frac45$, respectively. What is the fifth term? Show that it is \\frac{11}{15}.", "informal_proof": "Since the fifth term is halfway between the first term and ninth term, it is simply the average of these terms, or \\[\\frac{2/3 + 4/5}{2} = \\frac{11}{15}.\\]"}
