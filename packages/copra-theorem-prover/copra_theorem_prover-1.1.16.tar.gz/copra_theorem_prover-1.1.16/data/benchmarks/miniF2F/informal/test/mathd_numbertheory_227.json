{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_227", "informal_statement": "One morning each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk. The amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. How many people are in the family? Show that it is 5.", "informal_proof": "Suppose that the whole family drank $x$ cups of milk and $y$ cups of coffee. Let $n$ denote the number of people in the family. The information given implies that $\\frac{x}{4}+\\frac{y}{6}=\\frac{x+y}{n}$. This leads to \\[\n3x(n-4)=2y(6-n).\n\\]Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, the only positive integer $n$ for which both sides have the same sign is $n=5$."}
