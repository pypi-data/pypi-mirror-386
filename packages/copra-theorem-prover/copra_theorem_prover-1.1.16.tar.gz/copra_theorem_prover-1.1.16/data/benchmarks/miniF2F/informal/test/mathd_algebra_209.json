{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_209", "informal_statement": "Suppose that $h(x)=f^{-1}(x)$. If $h(2)=10$, $h(10)=1$ and $h(1)=2$, what is $f(f(10))$? Show that it is 1.", "informal_proof": "Since $f$ and $h$ are inverse functions and $h(2) = 10$, $f(10) = 2$, so $f(f(10)) = f(2)$.  And since $h(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 1$."}
