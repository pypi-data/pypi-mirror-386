{"problem_name": "aime_1984_p1", "informal_statement": "Find the value of $a_2+a_4+a_6+a_8+\\ldots+a_{98}$ if $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3\\ldots$ is an [[arithmetic progression]] with common difference 1, and $a_1+a_2+a_3+\\ldots+a_{98}=137$. Show that it is 093.", "informal_proof": "One approach to this problem is to apply the formula for the sum of an [[arithmetic series]] in order to find the value of $a_1$, then use that to calculate $a_2$ and sum another arithmetic series to get our answer.\n\nA somewhat quicker method is to do the following: for each $n \\geq 1$, we have $a_{2n - 1} = a_{2n} - 1$.  We can substitute this into our given equation to get $(a_2 - 1) + a_2 + (a_4 - 1) + a_4 + \\ldots + (a_{98} - 1) + a_{98} = 137$.  The left-hand side of this equation is simply $2(a_2 + a_4 + \\ldots + a_{98}) - 49$, so our desired value is $\\frac{137 + 49}{2} = 093$."}
