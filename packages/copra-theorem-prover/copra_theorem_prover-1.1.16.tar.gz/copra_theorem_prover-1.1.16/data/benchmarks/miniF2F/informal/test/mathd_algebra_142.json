{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_142", "informal_statement": "A line $\\ell$ passes through the points $B(7,-1)$ and $C(-1,7)$.  The equation of this line can be written in the form $y=mx+b$; compute $m+b$. Show that it is 5.", "informal_proof": "The line through points $B$ and $C$ has slope $\\dfrac{-1-7}{7-(-1)}=-1$.  Since $(7,-1)$ lies on the line, the line has equation $$y-(-1)=-1(x-7),$$or $y = -x + 6$.  Thus $m=-1$, $b=6$, and $m+b=-1+6=5$."}
