{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_107", "informal_statement": "Find the radius of the circle with equation $x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0$. Show that it is 5.", "informal_proof": "Completing the square gives us $(x +4)^2 + (y -3)^2 -25 = 0$. Rearranging terms, we have $(x +4)^2 + (y -3)^2 = 25$. It follows that the square of the radius is 25, so the radius must be $5$."}
