{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_276", "informal_statement": "The expression $10x^2-x-24$ can be written as $(Ax-8)(Bx+3),$ where $A$ and $B$ are integers. What is $AB + B$? Show that it is 12.", "informal_proof": "We see that $10x^2-x-24=(5x-8)(2x+3)$, thus $A = 5$ and $B = 2$. Hence, $AB + B = 12.$"}
