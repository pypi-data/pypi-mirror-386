{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_270", "informal_statement": "If $f(x) = \\dfrac{1}{x + 2},$ what is $f(f(1))$? Show that it is \\dfrac{3}{7}.", "informal_proof": "We see that $f(1) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + 2} = \\dfrac{1}{3}.$ Therefore, $f(f(1)) = f\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right) = \\dfrac{1}{\\frac{1}{3} + 2} = \\dfrac{1}{\\frac{7}{3}} = \\dfrac{3}{7}.$"}
