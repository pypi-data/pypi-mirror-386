{"problem_name": "algebra_abpbcpcageq3_sumaonsqrtapbgeq3onsqrt2", "informal_statement": "For positive real numbers a, b, c, such that $3 \\leq ab+bc+ca$, show that $3/\\sqrt{2} \\leq a/\\sqrt{a+b} + b/\\sqrt{b+c} + c/\\sqrt{c+a}$.", "informal_proof": "From Holder's inequality, we have $(\\sum \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{a+b}})^{2/3} (\\sum a(a+b))^{1/3} \\geq \\sum a$.\nHence $\\sum \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{a+b}} \\geq \\frac{(\\sum a)^{3/2}}{(\\sum a(a+b))^{1/2}}$. It thus suffices to prove $\\frac{(\\sum a)^3}{\\sum a(a+b)} \\geq \\frac{9}{2}$, which is equivalent to $2(\\sum a)^3 \\geq 9 (\\sum a^2 + \\sum ab)$.\n\nLet $p=\\sum a$ and $q=\\sum ab$. From the assumption we know that $q \\geq 3$. The inequality becomes $2p^3\\geq 9(p^2-q)$, which is equivalent to $2p^3+9q\\geq 9p^2$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have $2p^3 + 9q\\geq 2p^3 + 27 = p^3 + p^3 + 27 \\geq 3*(p^3*p^3*27)^{1/3} = 9p^2$. Hence the inequality holds."}
