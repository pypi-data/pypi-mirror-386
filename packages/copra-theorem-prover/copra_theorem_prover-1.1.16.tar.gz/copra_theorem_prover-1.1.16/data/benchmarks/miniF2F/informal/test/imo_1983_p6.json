{"problem_name": "imo_1983_p6", "informal_statement": "Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Prove that\n\n$a^2 b(a-b) + b^2 c(b-c) + c^2 a(c-a) \\geq 0$.\n\nDetermine when equality occurs.", "informal_proof": "By Ravi substitution, let $a = y+z$, $b = z+x$, $c = x+y$. Then, the triangle condition becomes $x, y, z > 0$. After some manipulation, the inequality becomes:\n\n$xy^3 + yz^3 + zx^3 \\geq xyz(x+y+z)$.\n\nBy Cauchy, we have: \n\n$(xy^3 + yz^3 + zx^3)(z+x+y) \\geq xyz(y+z+x)^2$ with equality if and only if $\\frac{xy^3}{z} = \\frac{yz^3}{x} =\\frac{zx^3}{y}$. So the inequality holds with equality if and only if x = y = z. Thus the original inequality has equality if and only if the triangle is equilateral."}
