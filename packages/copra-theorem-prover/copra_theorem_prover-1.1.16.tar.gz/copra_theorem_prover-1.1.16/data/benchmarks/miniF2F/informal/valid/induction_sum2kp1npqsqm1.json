{"problem_name": "induction_sum2kp1npqsqm1", "informal_statement": "Show that for positive integer n, $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 3) = (n + 1)^2 - 1$.", "informal_proof": "We use induction. The base case for $n=1$ states 2*0+3 = 2^2-1 which is true. Assuming the result holds for $n\\geq 0$, write $\\sum_{k=0}^n (2k + 3) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 3) + 2*n+3 = (n+1)^2 - 1 + 2n + 3 = n^2 + 4n + 4 - 1 = (n+2)^2 -1$. This shows the result holds for $n+1$ and concludes the proof by induction."}
