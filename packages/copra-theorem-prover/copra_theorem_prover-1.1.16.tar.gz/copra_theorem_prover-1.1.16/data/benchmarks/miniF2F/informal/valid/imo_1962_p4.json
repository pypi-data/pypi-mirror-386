{"problem_name": "imo_1962_p4", "informal_statement": "Solve the equation $\\cos^2{x}+\\cos^2{2x}+\\cos^2{3x}=1$.", "informal_proof": "First, note that we can write the left hand side as a cubic function of $\\cos^2 x$. So there are at most $3$ distinct values of $\\cos^2 x$ that satisfy this equation. Therefore, if we find three values of $x$ that satisfy the equation and produce three different $\\cos^2 x$, then we found all solutions to this cubic equation (without expanding it, which is another viable option). Indeed, we find that $\\frac{\\pi}2$, $\\frac{\\pi}4$, and $\\frac{\\pi}6$ all satisfy the equation, and produce three different values of $\\cos^2 x$, namely $0$, $\\frac12$, and $\\frac34$. So we solve $\\cos^2 x = \\text{each of these}$. Therefore, our solutions are:\n\n$x = \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}2,\\, \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}4,\\, \\frac{(6k+1)\\pi}6,\\, \\frac{(6k+5)\\pi}6 \\quad \\forall k\\in Z$"}
