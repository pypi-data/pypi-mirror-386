{"problem_name": "amc12a_2009_p7", "informal_statement": "The first three terms of an arithmetic sequence are $2x - 3$, $5x - 11$, and $3x + 1$ respectively. The $n$th term of the sequence is $2009$.

This solves to $x=4$. The first three terms then are $5$, $9$, and $13$. In general, the $n$th term is $1+4n$. Solving $1+4n=2009$, we get $n=502$."}
