{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_326", "informal_statement": "The product of three consecutive integers is 720. What is the largest of these integers? Show that it is 10.", "informal_proof": "Let the integers be $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$.  Their product is $n^3-n$.  Thus $n^3=720+n$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than $720$ is $729=9^3$, and indeed $729=720+9$.  So $n=9$ and the largest of the integers is $n+1=10$."}
