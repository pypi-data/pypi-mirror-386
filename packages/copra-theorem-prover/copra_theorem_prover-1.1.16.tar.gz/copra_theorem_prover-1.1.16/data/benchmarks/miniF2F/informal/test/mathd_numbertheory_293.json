{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_293", "informal_statement": "What digit must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer $20\\_7$ a multiple of 11? Show that it is 5.", "informal_proof": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = 5$ is the only digit that will work."}
