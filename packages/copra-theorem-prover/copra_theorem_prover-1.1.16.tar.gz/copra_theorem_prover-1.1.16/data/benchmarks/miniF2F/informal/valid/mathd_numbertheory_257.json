{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_257", "informal_statement": "Cards are numbered from 1 to 100. One card is removed and the values on the other 99 are added. The resulting sum is a multiple of 77. What number was on the card that was removed? Show that it is 45.", "informal_proof": "The sum of the numbers from 1 to 100 is \\[1 + 2 + \\dots + 100 = \\frac{100 \\cdot 101}{2} = 5050.\\] When this number is divided by 77, the remainder is 45.  Therefore, the number that was removed must be congruent to 45 modulo 77.\n\nHowever, among the numbers 1, 2, $\\dots$, 100, only the number $45$ itself is congruent to 45 modulo 77.  Therefore, this was the number of the card that was removed."}
