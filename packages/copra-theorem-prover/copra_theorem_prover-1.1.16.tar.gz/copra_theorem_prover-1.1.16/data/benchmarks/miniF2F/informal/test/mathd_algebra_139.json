{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_139", "informal_statement": "If $a \\star b = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{1}{b} - \\dfrac{1}{a}\\right)}{(a - b)}$, express $3 \\star 11$ as a common fraction. Show that it is \\frac{1}{33}.", "informal_proof": "We could plug in 3 and 11 to find the answer. However, note that $a \\star b = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{a - b}{ab}}{a - b} = \\dfrac{1}{ab}$. Therefore, $3 \\star 11 = \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 11} = \\frac{1}{33}$."}
