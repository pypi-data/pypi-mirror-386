{"problem_name": "amc12a_2020_p4", "informal_statement": "How many $4$-digit positive integers (that is, integers between $1000$ and $9999$, inclusive) having only even digits are divisible by $5?$\n\n$\\textbf{(A) } 80 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 100 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 125 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 200 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 500$ Show that it is \\textbf{(B) } 100.", "informal_proof": "The units digit, for all numbers divisible by 5, must be either $0$ or $5$. However, since all digits are even, the units digit must be $0$. The middle two digits can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, but the thousands digit can only be 2, 4, 6, or 8 since it cannot be zero. There is one choice for the units digit, 5 choices for each of the middle 2 digits, and 4 choices for the thousands digit, so there is a total of $4\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot1 = \\textbf{(B) } 100 \\qquad$ numbers."}
