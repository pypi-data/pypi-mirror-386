{"problem_name": "induction_seq_mul2pnp1", "informal_statement": "Let $u_n$ a sequence defined by $u_0 = 0$ and $\\forall n \\geq 0, u_{n+1} = 2 u_n + (n + 1)$. Show that $\\forall n \\geq 0, u(n) = 2^{n+1} - (n+2)$.", "informal_proof": "The property is true for $n=0$, since $2^{0+1}-(0+2)=0$.\nBy induction, assuming the property holds for $n\\geq 0$, we have\n$u_{n+1}=2u_n+(n+1)=2(2^{n+1}-(n+2))+n+1=2^{n+1+1}-(n+1+2)$, which shows the property at $n+1$."}
