{"problem_name": "amc12a_2020_p21", "informal_statement": "How many positive integers $n$ are there such that $n$ is a multiple of $5$, and the least common multiple of $5!$ and $n$ equals $5$ times the greatest common divisor of $10!$ and $n?$\n\n$\\textbf{(A) } 12 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 24 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 36 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 48 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 72$ Show that it is \\textbf{(D) } 48.", "informal_proof": "We set up the following equation as the problem states:\n\n$$ \\text{lcm}{(5!, n)} = 5\\text{gcd}{(10!, n)}.$$\n\nBreaking each number into its prime factorization, we see that the equation becomes\n\n$$ \\text{lcm}{(2^3\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5, n)} = 5\\text{gcd}{(2^8\\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7, n)}.$$\n\nWe can now determine the prime factorization of $n$. We know that its prime factors belong to the set $\\{2, 3, 5, 7\\}$, as no factor of $10!$ has $11$ in its prime factorization, nor anything greater. Next, we must find exactly how many different possibilities exist for each.\n\nThere can be anywhere between $3$ and $8$ $2$'s and $1$ to $4$ $3$'s. However, since $n$ is a multiple of $5$, and we multiply the $\\text{gcd}$ by $5$, there can only be $3$ $5$'s in $n$'s prime factorization. Finally, there can either $0$ or $1$ $7$'s.\n\nThus, we can multiply the total possibilities of $n$'s factorization to determine the number of integers $n$ which satisfy the equation, giving us $6 \\times 4 \\times 1 \\times 2 = \\textbf{(D) } 48$."}
