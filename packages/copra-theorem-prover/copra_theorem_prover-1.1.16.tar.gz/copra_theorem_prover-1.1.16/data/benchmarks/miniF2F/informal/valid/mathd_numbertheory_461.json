{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_461", "informal_statement": "Let $n$ be the number of integers $m$ in the range $1\\le m\\le 8$ such that $\\text{gcd}(m,8)=1$. What is the remainder when $3^n$ is divided by $8$? Show that it is 1.", "informal_proof": "The subset of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$ that contains the integers relatively prime to $8$ is $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$. So $n=4$ and $3^4=9^2\\equiv 1^2=1\\pmod 8$."}
