{"problem_name": "induction_12dvd4expnp1p20", "informal_statement": "Show that for any natural number $n$, 12 divides $4^{n+1} + 20$.", "informal_proof": "We have that $4 \\equiv 4 \\mod 12$ and $4^2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 12$. By immediate induction on $n$, we have that for every $n \\geq 1$, $4^n \\equiv 4 \\mod 12$. As a result, for any natural number $n$, $4^{n+1} + 20 \\equiv 4 + 20 \\mod 12$. Since $12$ divides $24$, $12$ divides $4^{n+1} + 20$."}
