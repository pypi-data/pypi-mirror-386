{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_137", "informal_statement": "Because of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment? Show that it is 575\\text{ students}.", "informal_proof": "If we knew last year's enrollment at Liberty Middle School, we would multiply by $1.04$ to get the new enrollment of $598$ students. Working backward, we can divide $598$ by $1.04$ to get $575\\text{ students}$. Alternatively, we could solve the equation $x + 0.04x = 598$, where $x$ is last year's enrollment."}
