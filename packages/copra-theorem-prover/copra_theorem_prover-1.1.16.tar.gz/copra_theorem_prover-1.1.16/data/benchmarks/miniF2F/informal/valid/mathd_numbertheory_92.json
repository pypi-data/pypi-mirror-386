{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_92", "informal_statement": "Solve the congruence $5n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{17}$, as a residue modulo 17.  (Give an answer between 0 and 16.) Show that it is 5.", "informal_proof": "Note that $8 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{17}$, so we can write the given congruence as $5n \\equiv 25 \\pmod{17}$.  Since 5 is relatively prime to 17, we can divide both sides by 5, to get $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{17}$."}
