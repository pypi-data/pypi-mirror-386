{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_440", "informal_statement": "Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike. If she continued at this rate, how many pints of water would she drink in the next 10 miles? Show that it is 5.", "informal_proof": "We can set up the ratios $\\frac{1.5}{3}=\\frac{x}{10}$, where $x$ is how many pints of water she'd drink in the next 10 miles. We cross-multiply to get $3x=1.5(10)=15$, which means $x=5$. Jasmine would drink $5$ pints of water in the next 10 miles."}
