{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_22", "informal_statement": "The two-digit number $``B6,''$ where $B$ is the tens digit, is the square of a positive integer. How many distinct possible values are there for $B$? Show that it is 2.", "informal_proof": "Of the two-digit perfect squares, only $4^2=16$ and $6^2=36$ end in $6$. Thus, there are $2$ distinct possible values for $B$."}
