{"problem_name": "amc12a_2021_p3", "informal_statement": "The sum of two natural numbers is $17{,}402$. One of the two numbers is divisible by $10$. If the units digit of that number is erased, the other number is obtained. What is the difference of these two numbers?\n\n$\\textbf{(A)} ~10{,}272\\qquad\\textbf{(B)} ~11{,}700\\qquad\\textbf{(C)} ~13{,}362\\qquad\\textbf{(D)} ~14{,}238\\qquad\\textbf{(E)} Show that it is \\textbf{(D)} ~14{,}238.", "informal_proof": "The units digit of a multiple of $10$ will always be $0$. We add a $0$ whenever we multiply by $10$. So, removing the units digit is equal to dividing by $10$.\n\nLet the smaller number (the one we get after removing the units digit) be $a$. This means the bigger number would be $10a$.\n\nWe know the sum is $10a+a = 11a$ so $11a=17402$. So $a=1582$. The difference is $10a-a = 9a$. So, the answer is $9(1582) = \\textbf{(D)} ~14{,}238$."}
