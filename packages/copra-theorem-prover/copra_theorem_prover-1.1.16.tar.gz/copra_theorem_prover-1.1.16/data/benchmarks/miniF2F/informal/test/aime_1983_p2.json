{"problem_name": "aime_1983_p2", "informal_statement": "Let $f(x)=|x-p|+|x-15|+|x-p-15|$, where $0 < p < 15$. Determine the [[minimum]] value taken by $f(x)$ for $x$ in the [[interval]] $p \\leq x\\leq15$. Show that it is 015.", "informal_proof": "It is best to get rid of the [[absolute value]]s first. \n\nUnder the given circumstances, we notice that $|x-p|=x-p$, $|x-15|=15-x$, and $|x-p-15|=15+p-x$.\n\nAdding these together, we find that the sum is equal to $30-x$, which attains its minimum value (on the given interval $p \\leq x \\leq 15$) when $x=15$, giving a minimum of $015$."}
