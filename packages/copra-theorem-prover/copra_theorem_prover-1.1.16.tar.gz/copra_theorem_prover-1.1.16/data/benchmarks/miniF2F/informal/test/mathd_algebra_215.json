{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_215", "informal_statement": "What is the sum of the two values of $x$ for which $(x+3)^2 = 121$? Show that it is -6.", "informal_proof": "Expanding the left side, we have $x^2+6x+9=121 \\Rightarrow x^2+6x-112=0$. For a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$. Applying this formula to the problem, we have that the sum of the two roots is $-6/1=-6$."}
