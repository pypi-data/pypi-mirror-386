[INFORMAL-THEOREM]
At which point do the lines $x=3-2y$ and $2x-y=1$ intersect? Give your answer as an ordered pair in the form $(x, y).$ Show that it is (1,1).
[INFORMAL-PROOFS]
We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get $$x=3-2(2x-1)=3-4x+2.$$ Moving the variable terms to the left-hand side and the constants to the right-hand side, we find $$x+4x=5.$$ This gives $x=1$ which we may plug into either equation to get $y$. For example, $$y=2(1)-1=1.$$ So the lines intersect at the point $(1,1)$.
