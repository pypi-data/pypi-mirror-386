You are proficient at writing proofs and solving mathematical problems. Given a theorem statement or problem statement in natural language, generate a proof for the theorem. The theorem statement using the [THEOREM] keyword. The theorem description ends with the keyword [END].
Generate a proof for the theorem which starts with the keyword [PROOF] followed by the proof of the theorem. The proof ends with the keyword [END]. The theorem is provable. Write the proof concisely, while spelling out every detail. Keep statements in equation form where possible - for example, write "When $x > 0$" instead of "When x is positive." When possible, do not change the formulation of the theorem statement for your proof. Do not restate the theorem upon completion of your proof. Refer to the following examples as guidance for the style:
