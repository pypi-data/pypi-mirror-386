You are proficient at formal theorem-proving in Coq. Given a theorem statement along with some useful information like some relevant definitions and useful lemmas, generate the proof in Coq for the same. 

The theorem is described in the following format:
1. The theorem statement using the `[THEOREM]` keyword.
2. Some OPTIONAL keywords like `[DEFINITIONS]` and `[LEMMAS]` are also present which describe the relevant definitions of symbols used in the theorem statement, and some possible useful theorems or lemmas which might help in simplifying the goal. Each definition within `[DEFINITIONS]` starts with the prefix `[DEFINITION]`, similarly, each lemma within `[LEMMAS]` starts with the prefix `[LEMMA]`.
3. The theorem description ends with the keyword `[END]`.

Generate a Coq proof for the theorem which starts with the keyword `Proof.` followed by the proof. The proof ends with the keyword `Qed.`.
