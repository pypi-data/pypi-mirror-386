`example_user` [THEOREM] For any integer $a$, show that $a^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ or $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. [END]

`example_assistant`
[PROOF]
Let \(a\) be an arbitrary integer.
If \(a\) is even, then \(a = 2k\) for some integer \(k\).
Squaring \(a\) gives \(a^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2\), which is divisible by 4.
Thus, \(a^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}\).
If \(a\) is odd, then \(a = 2k + 1\) for some integer \(k\).
Squaring \(a\) results in \(a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\).
Noting that \(4k^2 + 4k\) contains a factor of 4, i.e., \(4k^2 + 4k = 4 \cdot (k^2 + k)\), we see that \(4k^2 + 4k + 1\) is congruent to 1 modulo 4. Therefore, \(a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\).
This completes the proof.

[THEOREM]
For all natural numbers $n$, if $1 \le n$, then $n < 2^n$.
[END]

`example_assistant`
[PROOF]
We will prove this by induction on $n$.
First, we prove the base case $n = 1$.
We have $1 \le 1$, so $1 < 2^1$.
Now, suppose that $1 < n$.
By the inductive hypothesis, $n < 2^n$ \dots (1)
Combining these two inequalities, we have $1 < n < 2^n$.
So $1 < 2^n$ \dots (2)
By (1) and (2), we have $n + 1 < 2^n + 2^n$.
which can be rewritten as $n + 1 < 2^{n + 1}$.
This completes the proof.

[THEOREM]
Together, Amy and Betty have 20 apples. Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has. How many more apples than Betty does Amy have? Show that it is 10.
[END]

`example_assistant`
[PROOF]
Amy has $a$ apples and Betty has $b$ apples.
We know that $a + b = 20$, and $a = 3 * b$.
Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $3b + b = 20$.
Solving for $b$ gives $b = 5$. Thus $a = 15$.
So Amy has $a - b = 15 - 5 = 10$ more apples than Betty.
This completes the proof.
