"""
Inspector Core Module.

This module serves as the main entry point and orchestrator for the Inspector application.
It initializes logging, sets up the database, configures networking, and starts all core
background threads for device discovery, packet collection, processing, spoofing, and
network service discovery (mDNS, SSDP/UPnP). It also provides a command-line interface
for running Inspector as a standalone application.

Functions:
    start_threads(custom_packet_callback_func=None): Initializes and starts all Inspector threads.
    clean_up(): Disables IP forwarding and performs cleanup tasks.
    main(): Runs Inspector as a standalone application, handling process lifecycle and shutdown.

Dependencies:
    logging, time, os, sys, global_state, mem_db, networking, safe_loop, arp_scanner,
    packet_collector, packet_processor, arp_spoof, ssdp_discovery, mdns_discovery

Typical usage:
    python -m libinspector.core
