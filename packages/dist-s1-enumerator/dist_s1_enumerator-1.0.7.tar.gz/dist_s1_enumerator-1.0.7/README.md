This is a Python library for enumerating OPERA RTC-S1 inputs necessary for the creation of OPERA DIST-S1 products.
The library can enumerate inputs for the creation of a single DIST-S1 product or a time-series of DIST-S1 products over a large area spanning multiple passes.
The DIST-S1 measures disturbance comparing a baseline of RTC-S1 images (pre-images) to a current set of acquisition images (post-images).
This library also provides functionality for downloading the OPERA RTC-S1 data from ASF DAAC.


## Installation/Setup

We recommend managing dependencies and virutal environments using [mamba/conda](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/installation.html).

```bash
mamba update -f environment.yml  # creates a new environment dist-s1-enumerator
conda activate dist-s1-enumerator
pip install dist-s1-enumerator
python -m ipykernel install --user --name dist-s1-enumerator
```

### Downloading data

For searching through the metadata of OPERA RTC-S1, you will not need any earthdata credentials.
For downloading data from the ASF DAAC, you will need to make sure you have a Earthdata credentials (see: https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) and successfully accepted the ASF terms of use (this can be checked by downloading any product at the ASF DAAC using your Earthdata credentials: https://search.asf.alaska.edu/).
You will need to create or append to `~/.netrc` file with these credentials:
```
machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
    login <your_username>
    password <your_password>
```

### Development installation

Same as above replacing `pip install dist-s1-enumerator` with `pip install -e .`.

## Usage

### For triggering DIST-S1 Workflows

```
workflow_inputs = enumerate_dist_s1_workflow_inputs(mgrs_tile_ids='19HBD',
                                                    track_numbers=None,
                                                    start_acq_dt='2023-11-01',
                                                    stop_acq_dt='2024-04-01',
                                                    lookback_strategy='multi_window',
                                                    delta_lookback_days=365,
                                                    max_pre_imgs_per_burst=5)
```
Yields:
```
[{'mgrs_tile_id': '19HBD', 'post_acq_date': '2023-11-05', 'track_number': 91},
 {'mgrs_tile_id': '19HBD', 'post_acq_date': '2023-11-10', 'track_number': 156},
 {'mgrs_tile_id': '19HBD', 'post_acq_date': '2023-11-12', 'track_number': 18}...]
```
Where these fields uniquely determine a DIST-S1 product and can be used to trigger the workflow.

### For collecting DIST-S1 inputs

The above example tells us the recent acquisition date that disturbance is made relative to (`post_acq_date`) over an MGRS tile (`mgrs_tile_id`).
However, there are many OPERA RTC-S1 products used on that given date and to establish a baseline.
To enumerate all the necessary inputs (which can be further localized with this library), see the [Jupyter notebooks](./notebooks).

- [Enumerating inputs for a single DIST-S1 product](./notebooks/A__Staging_Inputs_for_One_MGRS_Tile.ipynb)
- [Enumerating inputs for a time-series of DIST-S1 products](./notebooks/B__Enumerate_MGRS_tile.ipynb)

### Identifiers for DIST-S1 products

Of course, knowing all the OPERA RTC-S1 products (pre-images and post-images) necessary for a DIST-S1 product uniquely identifies the products.
However, all these inputs can be amount to upwards of 100 products for each DIST-S1 product and is not human parsable.
Thus, it is helpful to know alterate ways to identify and trigger the DIST-S1 product and its' workflow.

Altenrately, we can uniqely identify a DIST-S1 product via the following fields:

1. MGRS Tile ID
2. Track Number
3. Post-image acquisition time (within 1 day)

As shown in [For triggering DIST-S1 Workflows](#for-triggering-dist-s1-workflows) section, that is precisely the output of `enumerate_dist_s1_workflow_inputs`.

We now explain why these fields uniquely identify DIST-S1 products.
Each DIST-S1 product is resampled to an MGRS tile.
One might assume that the post-image acquisition time is enough - however, there are particular instances when Sentinel-1 A and Sentinel-1 C will pass each other in the same day and so fixing the track number differentiates between the two sets of acquisired imagery.
Thus, it is important to specify the date in addition to the track number.
In theory, we could specify the exact time of acquisition, but we have elected to use track numbers.
It is also important to note that we are assuming the selection of pre-images (once a post-image set is selected) is fixed.
Indeed, varying a baseline of pre-images by which to measure disturbance will alter the final DIST-S1 product.
Indeed, we can modify strategies of pre-image selection using this library (e.g. `multi_window` vs. `immediate_lookback`), but for DIST-S1 generation which has a fixed strategy with associated parameters, the above 3 fields uniquely identify a DIST-S1 product.

# Testing

For the test suite:

1. Install `papermill` via `conda-forge` (currently not supported by 3.13)
2. Run `pytest tests`

There are two category of tests: unit tests and integration tests. The former can be run using `pytest tests -m 'not integration'` and similarly the latter with `pytest tests -m 'integration'`. The intgeration tests are those that can be integrated into the DAAC data access workflows and thus require internet access with earthdata credentials setup correctly (as described above). The unit tests mock the necessary data inputs.
The integration tests that are the most time consuming are represented by the notebooks and are run only upon a release PR.
These notebook tests are tagged with `notebooks` and can be excluded from the other tests with `pytest tests -m 'not notebooks'`.

# Remarks about the Dateline/Dateline and Geometry

The antimeridian (or dateline) is the line at the -180 longitude mark that global CRS tiles are wrapped by standard global reference systems.
The geometries of the bursts and the MGRS tiles in this package are all in `epsg:4326` (standard lon/lat). 
The geometries are all between -180 and 180 so those geometries that cross the antimeridian/dateline are generally wrapped.
For MGRS tiles, the statement that a geometry overlaps the antimeridian occurs if and only if the geometry is a Polygon.
The same is true for burst geometries.
See `test_antimeridian_crossing` in [`tests/test_mgrs_burst_data.py`](tests/test_mgrs_burst_data.py).
