# OpenEarth API

OpenEarth is a lightweight API for agents to query real‑time Earth insights. Insights are curated to your use case. The API takes in natural‑language questions, fetches live data, and returns a unified, structured response plus a concise natural‑language summary.

## Installation

```bash
pip install openearth
```

## API Usage

```python
from openearth import OpenEarth

oe = OpenEarth()

# Wildfire queries
result = oe.query("What crops might be impacted by fires in Napa Valley?")

# Flood risk queries
result = oe.query("How will flash flooding potential impact delivery routes in Miami?")

# Air quality queries  
result = oe.query("Is there smoke affecting air quality in Portland?")
```
