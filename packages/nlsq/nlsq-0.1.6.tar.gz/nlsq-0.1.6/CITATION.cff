abstract: "NLSQ is an enhanced fork of JAXFit, providing JAX-accelerated nonlinear least squares curve fitting with GPU/TPU support. Building upon the original JAXFit implementation, NLSQ adds advanced features for large datasets, memory management, algorithm selection, and improved stability. It offers a drop-in replacement for SciPy's curve_fit with automatic differentiation."
