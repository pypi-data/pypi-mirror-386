class QARouter:
    """
    QA from Refinitiv is usually served through an external mssql, oracle or snowflake database.
    We are going to use it in a mostly read-only way, therefore we need a DBRouter that routes
    all database connections for models from QA to the correct database. The database needs to be
    registered in the settings of the project like this:

    ```
    DATABASES = {
        "default": {}, # This is the default django database
        "qa": {},  # This is the important database. The name qa is really important here.
    }
    ```
    Afterwards the settings needs to declare this router explicately as one of the `DATABASE_ROUTERS`
