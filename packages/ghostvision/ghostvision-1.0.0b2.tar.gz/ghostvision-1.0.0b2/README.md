## Overview

`GhostVision` is an open-source Python interface for automatically detecting and mapping ghost (derelict) crab pots from side-scan sonar imagery. `GhostVision` leverages [`Yolo`](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) models trained with [`Roboflow`](https://roboflow.com/). Detections are then georeferenced with [`PINGMapper`](https://github.com/CameronBodine/PINGMapper).

## Installation

### GPU (Fast Inference)

`GhostVision` is optimized for running inference (predictions) on the GPU. The processing environment is installed with `conda`. Any flavor of `conda` will do, but we recommend [`Miniforge`](https://conda-forge.org/download/). Follow the instructions below based on your OS.

#### Windows Only
Windows does not natively support inference on the GPU. A utility called [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) needs to be installed in order to run inference on the GPU.

1. Install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) & 
2. Open the command prompt by launching `Ubuntu` from the Windows Start menu.

#### Install `Miniforge`

3. In a command prompt, download [`Miniforge`](https://conda-forge.org/download/) with:
    ```
    wget "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
    ```
4. Install [`Miniforge`](https://conda-forge.org/download/) with:
    ```
    bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
    ```

#### Install `GhostVision`

5. Install `PINGInstaller`:
    ```
    pip install pinginstaller
    ```
6. Install `GhostVision`:
    ```
    python -m pinginstaller ghostvision-gpu
    ```

### CPU (Slow Inference; Experimental)
An experimental version of `GhostVision` is available to test inference speeds on the CPU. This has been tested on Windows 11 only.

1. Install [`Miniforge`](https://conda-forge.org/download/).
2. Open the [`Miniforge`](https://conda-forge.org/download/) prompt.
3. Install `PINGInstaller`:
    ```
    pip install pinginstaller
    ```
4. Install `GhostVision`.
    ```
    python -m pinginstaller ghostvision
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the appropriate command prompt based on your installation above.
2. Launch `GhostVision`:
    ```
    conda activate ghostvision
    python -m ghostvision
    ```
3. Select desired parameters and click `Submit`.

## Download Custom `Roboflow` Object Detection Model

`GhostVision` includes `Roboflow` object detection models designed to detect crab pots from side-scan sonar imagery. You can train and use your own object detection model by downloading the model from `Roboflow` with the included utility.

1. Open the appropriate command prompt based on your installation above.
2. Launch the Roboflow model download utility:
    ```
    conda activate ghostvision
    python -m ghostvision rf-download
    ```
3. Supply your [Roboflow API Key](https://docs.roboflow.com/developer/authentication/find-your-roboflow-api-key).
4. Enter the project name (all lowercase).
5. Enter the project version.

The model will be downloaded and available to use.
