              accordance with the laws of the state of California, without reference to
              its conflict of laws principles.  If Licensee is located within the
              United States, all disputes arising out of this Agreement are subject to
              the exclusive jurisdiction of courts located in Santa Clara County,
              California. USA.  If Licensee is located outside of the United States,
              any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
              Agreement will be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in
              accordance with the JAMS International Arbitration Rules.  The tribunal
              will consist of one arbitrator.  The place of arbitration will be Palo

              will be English.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may

              Agreement and all licenses and rights granted hereunder will immediately
              terminate.  Waiver by Collate of a breach of any provision of this
              Agreement or the failure by Collate to exercise any right hereunder
              will not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of that right
              or as a waiver of any other right.

This guide will help you setup the Ingestion framework and connectors
---

![Python version 3.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9%2B-blue)

OpenMetadata Ingestion is a simple framework to build connectors and ingest metadata of various systems through OpenMetadata APIs. It could be used in an orchestration framework(e.g. Apache Airflow) to ingest metadata.
**Prerequisites**

- Python &gt;= 3.9.x

### Docs

Please refer to the documentation here https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors

### TopologyRunner

All the Ingestion Workflows run through the TopologyRunner.

The flow is depicted in the images below.
