FBGEMM_GPU (FBGEMM GPU Kernels Library) is a collection of high-performance
PyTorch GPU operator libraries for training and inference.  The library provides
efficient table batched embedding bag, data layout transformation, and
quantization supports.

See the full [Documentation](https://pytorch.org/FBGEMM) for more information
on building, installing, and developing with FBGEMM_GPU, as well as the most
up-to-date support matrix for this library.
