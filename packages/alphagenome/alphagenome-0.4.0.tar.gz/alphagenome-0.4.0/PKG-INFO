           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# AlphaGenome

![PyPI Python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/AlphaGenome)
![Presubmit Checks](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphagenome/actions/workflows/presubmit_checks.yml/badge.svg)

[**Get API key**](https://deepmind.google.com/science/alphagenome) |
[**Quick start**](#quick-start) | [**Installation**](#installation) |
[**Documentation**](https://www.alphagenomedocs.com/) |
[**Community**](https://www.alphagenomecommunity.com) |
[**Terms of Use**](https://deepmind.google.com/science/alphagenome/terms)

The AlphaGenome API provides access to AlphaGenome, Google DeepMind’s unifying
model for deciphering the regulatory code within DNA sequences. This repository
contains client-side code, examples and documentation to help you use the
AlphaGenome API.

AlphaGenome offers multimodal predictions, encompassing diverse functional
outputs such as gene expression, splicing patterns, chromatin features, and
contact maps (see [diagram below](#model_overview)). The model analyzes DNA
sequences of up to 1 million base pairs in length and can deliver predictions at
single base-pair resolution for most outputs. AlphaGenome achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a range of genomic prediction benchmarks,
including numerous diverse variant effect prediction tasks (detailed in
[Avsec et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.25.661532)).

The API is offered free of charge for
[non-commercial use](https://deepmind.google.com/science/alphagenome/terms)
(subject to the terms of use). Query rates vary based on demand – it is well
suited for smaller to medium-scale analyses such as analysing a limited number
of genomic regions or variants requiring 1000s of predictions, but is likely not
suitable for large scale analyses requiring more than 1 million predictions.
Once you obtain your API key, you can easily get started by following our
[Quick Start Guide](#quick-start), or watching our
[AlphaGenome 101 tutorial](https://youtu.be/Xbvloe13nak).

<a id='model_overview'>

![Model overview](docs/source/_static/model_overview.png)

</a>

The documentation also covers a set of comprehensive tutorials, variant scoring
strategies to efficiently score variant effects, and a visualization library to
generate `matplotlib` figures for the different output modalities.

We cover additional details of the capabilities and limitations in our
documentation. For support and feedback:

-   Please submit bugs and any code-related issues on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphagenome/issues).
-   For general feedback, questions about usage, and/or feature requests, please
    use the [community forum](https://www.alphagenomecommunity.com) – it’s
    actively monitored by our team so you're likely to find answers and insights
    faster.
-   If you can't find what you're looking for, please get in touch with the
    AlphaGenome team on alphagenome@google.com and we will be happy to assist
    you with questions. We’re working hard to answer all inquiries but there may
    be a short delay in our response due to the high volume we are receiving.

## Quick start

The quickest way to get started is to run our example notebooks in
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Here are some starter
notebooks:

-   [Quick start](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/alphagenome/blob/main/colabs/quick_start.ipynb):
    An introduction to quickly get you started with using the model and making
    predictions.
-   [Visualizing predictions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/alphagenome/blob/main/colabs/visualization_modality_tour.ipynb):
    Learn how to visualize different model predictions using the visualization
    libraries.

Alternatively, you can dive straight in by following the
[installation guide](#installation) and start writing code! Here's an example of
making a variant prediction:

```python
from alphagenome.data import genome
from alphagenome.models import dna_client
from alphagenome.visualization import plot_components
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


API_KEY = 'MyAPIKey'
model = dna_client.create(API_KEY)

interval = genome.Interval(chromosome='chr22', start=35677410, end=36725986)
variant = genome.Variant(
    chromosome='chr22',
    position=36201698,
    reference_bases='A',
    alternate_bases='C',
)

outputs = model.predict_variant(
    interval=interval,
    variant=variant,
    ontology_terms=['UBERON:0001157'],
    requested_outputs=[dna_client.OutputType.RNA_SEQ],
)

plot_components.plot(
    [
        plot_components.OverlaidTracks(
            tdata={
                'REF': outputs.reference.rna_seq,
                'ALT': outputs.alternate.rna_seq,
            },
            colors={'REF': 'dimgrey', 'ALT': 'red'},
        ),
    ],
    interval=outputs.reference.rna_seq.interval.resize(2**15),
    # Annotate the location of the variant as a vertical line.
    annotations=[plot_components.VariantAnnotation([variant], alpha=0.8)],
)
plt.show()
```
