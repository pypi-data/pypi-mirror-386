# commonmeta-py

commonmeta-py is a Python library to implement Commonmeta, the common Metadata Model for Scholarly Metadata. Use commonmeta-py to convert scholarly metadata, in a variety of formats, listed below. Commonmeta-py is work in progress, the first release on PyPi (version 0.5.0) was on February 16, 2023. Up until version 0.5.1, the library was called talbot. Commonmeta-py is modelled after the [commonmeta-ruby ruby gem](https://github.com/front-matter/commonmeta-ruby).

commonmeta-py uses semantic versioning. Currently, its major version number is still at 0, meaning the API is not yet stable, and breaking changes are expected in the internal API and commonmeta JSON format.

_commonmeta_: the Commonmeta format is the native format for the library and used internally.
_Planned_: we plan to implement this format for the v1.0 public release.
_Later_: we plan to implement this format in a later release.

## Documentation

Documentation (work in progress) for using the library is available at the [commonmeta-py Documentation](https://python.commonmeta.org/) website and includes several interactive Jupyter Notebooks .
