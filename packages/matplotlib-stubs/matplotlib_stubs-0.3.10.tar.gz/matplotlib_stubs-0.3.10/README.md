# Matplotlib Stubs

Unofficial python stubs for the [matplotlib package](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/).

[Official matplotlib stubs now exist](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/24976) (in matplotlib>=3.8), so this repo was archived from 2023/09/19 to 2025/08/02.\
However, the official stubs are still incomplete, so this repo was unarchived.

## Acknowledgements

The code in this repo is taken from [Microsoft's Python Type Stubs repo](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs) and made pip installable (with some improvements).

## Installation
