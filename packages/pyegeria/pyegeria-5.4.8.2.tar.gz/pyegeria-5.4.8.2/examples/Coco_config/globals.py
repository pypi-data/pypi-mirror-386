# a metadata server or a specialized governance server.  Its behavior is determined
# by a configuration document that defines which OMAG services are activated.
# All OMAG Server Platforms support the administration md_commands to define a server's
# configuration document.  It is also possible to create configuration documents
# through admin calls to one OMAG Server Platform and then deploy them to the
# OMAG Server Platform where they are to run.  In the Egeria hands on lab, the
# OMAG Server configuration is created on the dev platform and deployed to the
# production platforms as needed.
