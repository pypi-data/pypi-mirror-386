Use Cases / Context
===================

When the taxes are the same in every sales line, that information might
be redundant with the taxes summary and takes valuable space that other
columns might take.

This might be event more annoying when there's tax exemptions like in EU
intracomunitary operations.

Usage
=====

Whenever the taxes are in the same group for the whole order the column
won't be displayed.
