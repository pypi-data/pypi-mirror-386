Reskinner is a Python 3 library for [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/pysimplegui/pysimplegui) and [FreeSimpleGUI](https://github.com/spyoungtech/FreeSimpleGUI) that enables changing the theme of a GUI window at runtime **without** needing to recreate or re-instantiate the window.

It provides a smooth, dynamic way to update your application's appearance on the fly, with optional animations and support for multiple color interpolation and easing modes. Reskinner is lightweight, easy to integrate, and works with both major PySimpleGUI-compatible frameworks.
