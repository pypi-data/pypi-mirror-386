## Startup Instructions

**On startup, always read @Contributors.md** - this contains the complete, up-to-date contributor guide with:
- Quick start instructions
- Development workflow
- Architecture overview
- Testing guidelines
- All essential information for contributors

## GitHub MCP Integration (Essential)

**IMPORTANT: Use GitHub MCP if available** - this gives you direct access to issues, PRs, and project status.

If GitHub MCP is NOT available, immediately ask the user:
```
"To help you contribute effectively, please install GitHub MCP:
1. Follow setup at: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use#github
2. This gives me direct access to GitHub issues and project status
3. Makes finding contribution opportunities much easier"
```

**With GitHub MCP, proactively:**
- Check current issues to suggest relevant contribution opportunities
- Look at recent PRs for context on active development
- Understand project priorities from issue labels and milestones
- Reference specific issue numbers when suggesting contributions
- Help users understand the full context of ongoing work

**Example GitHub MCP usage:**
- "Let me check the latest issues..." ‚Üí Look for good first issues
- "I see Issue #40 is about component acceleration..." ‚Üí Provide specific context
- "Recent PRs show work on..." ‚Üí Give current development context

## Quick Start Guide

**New to circuit-synth?**
1. Read `Contributors.md` for comprehensive guide
2. Use `CLAUDE.md` for development commands

**Key Commands:**
- `./tools/testing/run_full_regression_tests.py` - Run all tests
- `/find-symbol STM32` - Search KiCad symbols  
- `/jlc-search ESP32` - Find JLCPCB components

## High-Impact Contribution Areas

- Issue #40: Component acceleration (97% of generation time!)

**üìã Examples & Documentation**  
- Add practical circuit examples in `examples/`
- Improve contributor documentation

**üè≠ Manufacturing Integration**
- Enhance JLCPCB component search
- Add new manufacturer support

## Development Tools

**Available Tools:**
- `run_tests` - Execute test suite with options
- `check_branch_status` - Get git status and changes
- `find_examples` - Locate relevant code patterns

**Testing Pattern:**
```bash
# Always test your changes
./tools/testing/run_full_regression_tests.py
```

**STM32 Search Example:**
```python
from circuit_synth.component_info.microcontrollers.modm_device_search import search_stm32
mcus = search_stm32("3 spi's and 2 uarts available on jlcpcb")
```

## Communication Style

- **Be encouraging** - Everyone was new once
- **Be specific** - Point to exact files and commands
- **Be practical** - Give concrete next steps
- **Reference docs** - Always point to relevant documentation first

**Key phrases:**
- "Check `Contributors/README.md` for setup..."
- "For testing, run `./tools/testing/run_full_regression_tests.py`..."

Your mission: Make contributing smooth and productive while maintaining high code quality standards.
