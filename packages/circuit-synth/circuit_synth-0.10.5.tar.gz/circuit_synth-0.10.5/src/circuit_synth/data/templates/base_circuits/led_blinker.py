"""LED Blinker - Basic LED Circuit with Current Limiting

This example demonstrates:
- Using LED components from Device library
- Calculating current limiting resistor values
- Working with different footprints
- Component value specification
- Named pin connections (anode/cathode)

LED specifications:
- Forward voltage (Vf): 2.0V (typical for red LED)
- Forward current (If): 20mA (maximum safe continuous current)
- Supply voltage (Vcc): 3.3V

Resistor calculation: R = (Vcc - Vf) / If
R = (3.3V - 2.0V) / 20mA = 1.3V / 0.02A = 65Œ©

Standard value: 68Œ© (closest standard value, allows ~19mA - safe for LED)
