An extension of pandas for efficient representation of nested
associated datasets.

Nested-Pandas extends the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package with 
tooling and support for nested dataframes packed into values of top-level 
dataframe columns. [Pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) 
is used internally to aid in scalability and performance.

Nested-Pandas allows data like this:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./docs/intro_images/pandas_dfs.png" alt="pandas dataframes" width="400"/>
</p>

To instead be represented like this:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./docs/intro_images/nestedframe_example.png" alt="nestedframe" width="300"/>
</p>

Where the nested data is represented as nested dataframes:

```python
   # Each row of "object_nf" now has it's own sub-dataframe of matched rows from "source_df"
   object_nf.loc[0]["nested_sources"]
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="./docs/intro_images/loc_into_nested.png" alt="sub-dataframe" width="225"/>
</p>

Allowing powerful and straightforward operations, like:

```python
   # Compute the mean flux for each row of "object_nf"
   import numpy as np

   def mean_flux(row):
   """Calculates the mean flux for each object"""
       return np.mean(row["nested_sources.flux"])

   object_nf.map_rows(mean_flux, output_names="mean_flux")
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="./docs/intro_images/reduce.png" alt="using reduce" width="150"/>
</p>

Nested-Pandas is motivated by time-domain astronomy use cases, where we see
typically two levels of information, information about astronomical objects and
then an associated set of `N` measurements of those objects. Nested-Pandas offers
a performant and memory-efficient package for working with these types of datasets. 

Core advantages being:
* hierarchical column access
* efficient packing of nested information into inputs to custom user functions
* avoiding costly groupby operations
