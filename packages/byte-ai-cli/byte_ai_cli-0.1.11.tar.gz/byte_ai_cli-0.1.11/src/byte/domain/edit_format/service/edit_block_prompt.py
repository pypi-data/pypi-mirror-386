	# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

	Use *SEARCH/REPLACE blocks* to make precise edits to files. Each block specifies:
	- **What file** to modify (with full path)
	- **What content** to find (SEARCH section)
	- **What to replace** it with (REPLACE section)

	## Block Format:

	Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this exact format:
	1. Opening fence with language: ```python
	2. Operation type and file path: `+++++++` or `-------` followed by the *FULL* file path
	3. Search marker: <<<<<<< SEARCH
	4. Content to find (can be empty)
	5. Divider: =======
	6. Content to replace with (can be empty)
	7. Replace marker: >>>>>>> REPLACE
	8. Closing fence: ```

	## Operation Types:
	- `+++++++` for **editing** existing files or **creating** new files
	- `-------` for **removing** files or **replacing entire file contents**

	## Examples:

	**Create a new file:**
	```python
	+++++++ mathweb/flask/app.py
	<<<<<<< SEARCH
	=======
	import math
	from flask import Flask
	>>>>>>> REPLACE
	```

	**Edit existing file content:**
	```python
	+++++++ mathweb/flask/app.py
	<<<<<<< SEARCH
	from flask import Flask
	=======
	import math
	from flask import Flask
	>>>>>>> REPLACE
	```

   **Remove entire file:**
	```python
	------- mathweb/flask/app.py
	<<<<<<< SEARCH
	=======
	>>>>>>> REPLACE
	```

	**Replace all file contents:**
	```python
	------- mathweb/flask/app.py
	<<<<<<< SEARCH
	=======
	import math
	from flask import Flask
	>>>>>>> REPLACE
	```

	## **CRITICAL RULES:**

	File Paths:
	- Use the FULL file path exactly as shown by the user
	- No bold asterisks, quotes, or escaping around the path

	Search Content:
	- Must EXACTLY MATCH existing file content, character for character
	- Include all comments, docstrings, whitespace, etc.
	- If file contains wrapped/escaped content, match the literal file contents

	Block Strategy:
	- Keep blocks small and focused
	- Use multiple blocks for multiple changes to the same file
	- Include enough context lines to make each search unique
	- Only replace the first occurrence found

	File Operations:
	- Only edit files that the user has added to the chat
	- For new files: use +++++++ with empty SEARCH, content in REPLACE
	- To move code: use 2 blocks (1 to delete, 1 to insert)
	- To rename files: use shell commands after your response

	User Intent:
	- If user says "ok", "go ahead", or "do that" â†’ provide SEARCH/REPLACE blocks
	- Wait for user confirmation before assuming edits are applied
	- ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK!""")
