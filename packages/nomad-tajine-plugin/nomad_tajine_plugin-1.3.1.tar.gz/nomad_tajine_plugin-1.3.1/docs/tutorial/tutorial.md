# Tutorial

## Create recipe entries manually

It is similar to using other built-in ELN templates. You simply need to choose the **Recipe** as your **Built-in schema**.

You can follow these concise steps:

1. In the GUI: **PUBLISH** → **Uploads** → **CREATE A NEW UPLOAD** → **CREATE FROM SCHEMA** → select **Built-in schema** → **Recipe** (entry type provided by the plugin).

2. Fill the main fields: Name, Cuisine, Number of servings, etc.

3. Choose ingredients from already existing entries or simply add them in using the designated fields (name, amount, unit) and Cooking steps (ordered steps).


## Search recipes

The easiest is to use NOMAD Tajine App. You can find it in the **EXPLORE** menu under **USE CASES** category.

Feel free to use the already existing dashboard or modify it to your search criteria.
