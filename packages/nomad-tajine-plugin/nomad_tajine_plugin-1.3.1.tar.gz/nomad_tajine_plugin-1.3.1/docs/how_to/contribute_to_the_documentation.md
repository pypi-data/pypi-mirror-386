# Contribute to the documentation

The steps are the same as briefly mentioned [here](contribute_to_this_plugin.md#contribute-to-this-plugin).

Noteworthy is that the docs are Markdown and deployed using **MkDocs**.

After you modified or added to the docs, preview them locally for a final sanity check:

```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
```
