# Example tajine recipe

This is a simple example for a recipe for a Moroccan chicken tagine. It demonstrates the use of the `nomad-tajine` schema to store recipes containing multiple steps. Each step defines ingredients and kitchen tools.

Consult the [`nomad-tajine` documentation](link) to learn more about the recipe schemas.

This example uploads contains one file (`tajine.archive.yaml`) that uses the `Recipe` class `nomad-tajine` schema. In addition, it contains several instances of the `Ingredient` and `Tool` classes, which are used with the Tajine recipe.
