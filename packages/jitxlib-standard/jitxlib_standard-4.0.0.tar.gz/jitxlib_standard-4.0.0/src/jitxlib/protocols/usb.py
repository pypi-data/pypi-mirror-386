USB Protocol
============

This package contains the definitions for the Universal Serial Bus protocol.

Transport vs Connector Bundles
------------------------------


The USB protocol contains many different layers from physical to logical. The bundles in
this package are organized to support two levels in the application:

  1. Transport - This is the set of signals that convey the information in the
     bus. These signals typically traverse many components from the connector to
     the processor endpoint.

     These signals typically have SI constraints attached to them.

  2. Connector - This is the physical layer where the USB cable meets the
     board. This interface may have power, shield, and other accessory pins in
     addition to the transport layer signals. These additional connections may
     or may not make there way to the processor endpoint.

In the code below, the "transport" bundles are what you would typically use
when connecting up the different modules of your circuit. The "connector"
bundles are typically used to define the ports on a physical connector
component or module that contains the physical connector component.


Symmetry in Transport Bundles
-----------------------------

If you look closely at the bundles defined below, you will notice some symmetry
in the definitions of the transport bundles.

The :py:class:`USBData` bundle defines the USB2.0 interface with port ``data``.
This same interface gets reused in :py:class:`USBSuperSpeed` and
:py:class:`USB_C` later on.

Similarly, we use ``lane`` to define an array of
:py:class:`~jitx.common.LanePair`` bundles (RX + TX differential pairs). This
same pattern gets used in :py:class:`USB_C`.

This is not by accident. The reason we structure the bundles this way is:

  1. They can easily used in ``provide/require`` pin assignment statements.
  2. We can simplify the implementation of the connect, constrain, and routing
     structure application functions.

Matching Lanes
--------------

For most of the constraint functions in this package, the bundle types
themselves are not checked for equality. Instead - we check for matching
lane configurations. This allows a :py:class:`USBSuperSpeed` and
:py:class:`USB_C` transport bundle to connect to each other if they have the
correct number of lanes defined.
