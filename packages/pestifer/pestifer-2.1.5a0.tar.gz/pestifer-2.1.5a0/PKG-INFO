Pestifer is a fully automated simulation-ready MD system preparation tool, requiring as inputs only biomolecular structures (e.g., PDB IDs, PDB files, mmCIF files, alphafold IDs) and a handful of customization parameters, to generate NAMD-compatible input files (PSF, PDB, and xsc).  It is basically a highly functionalized front end for VMD's `psfgen` utility.  It also has a few handy subcommands for working with NAMD output.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pestifer
```

Once installed, the user has access to the main `pestifer` command. 

Pestifer also requires access to the following executables:

1. `namd3` and `charmrun`
2. `vmd` and `catdcd`
3. `packmol`

Pestifer **includes a copy of** the [July 2024 Charmm36 force field](https://mackerell.umaryland.edu/download.php?filename=CHARMM_ff_params_files/toppar_c36_jul24.tgz).
