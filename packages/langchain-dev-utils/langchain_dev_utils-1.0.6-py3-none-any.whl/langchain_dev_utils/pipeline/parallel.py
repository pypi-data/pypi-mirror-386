    """
    Create a parallel pipeline from a list of subgraphs.

    This function allows you to compose multiple StateGraphs in a parallel fashion,
    where subgraphs can execute concurrently. This is useful for creating complex
    multi-agent workflows where agents can work independently or with dynamic branching.

    Args:
        sub_graphs: List of sub-graphs to execute in parallel
        state_schema: state schema of the final constructed graph
        graph_name: Name of the final constructed graph
        branches_fn: Optional function to determine which sub-graphs to execute in parallel
        context_schema: context schema of the final constructed graph
        input_schema: input schema of the final constructed graph
        output_schema: output schema of the final constructed graph
        checkpointer: Optional LangGraph checkpointer for the final constructed graph
        store: Optional LangGraph store for the final constructed graph
        cache: Optional LangGraph cache for the final constructed graph

    Returns:
        CompiledStateGraph[StateT, ContextT, InputT, OutputT]: Compiled state graph of the pipeline.
