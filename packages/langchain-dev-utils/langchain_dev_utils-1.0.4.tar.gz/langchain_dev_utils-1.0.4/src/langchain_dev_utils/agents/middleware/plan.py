This tool is used to create new task plans or modify existing plans.

Args:
    task_list: A list of strings representing tasks to be executed.
               The first task will automatically be set to 'in_progress' status,
               while all other tasks will be set to 'pending' status.
               Internally, each string is converted to a dictionary containing 
               'content' and 'status' keys, where content corresponds to each value in the string list,
               and status values are: the first task is 'in_progress', and the remaining tasks are 'pending'.

               When modifying plans, only provide the tasks that need to be executed next.
               For example, if the current plan is 
               ['task1', 'task2', 'task3'] and task1 is completed, but you
               determine that task2 and task3 are no longer appropriate and
               should be replaced with ['task4', 'task5'], simply pass
               ['task4', 'task5'].

## Tool Function
This tool is used to **create new plans** or **modify existing plans**.

- **Primary use**: Create new task plans
- **Secondary use**: Modify plans when issues are identified in existing plans
- **Not for**: Marking task completion status

## Task States
Use the following states to track progress:
- `pending`: Task not yet started
- `in_progress`: Currently being processed
- `done`: Task completed

## Usage Specifications

### Creating Plans (Primary Use)
Call this tool to create structured task lists when dealing with complex tasks:
- Complex multi-step tasks (≥3 steps)
- Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning
- When user explicitly requests a task list
- When user provides multiple task items

### Modifying Plans (Special Circumstances)
Modify existing plans only in the following cases:
- When current plan structure is identified as problematic
- When task structure or content needs adjustment
- When existing plan cannot be executed effectively

**Important Update Behavior**: When updating plans, only pass the list of tasks that need to be executed next. The tool will automatically handle status assignment - first task as `in_progress`, others as `pending`.

### Task Completion
**Important**: When completing subtasks, call the `finish_sub_plan()` function to update task status, NOT this tool.

## When to Use
**Usage scenarios**:
- When starting new complex work sessions
- When needing to restructure task organization
- When current plan requires revision based on new information

**Avoid usage scenarios**:
- Simple tasks (<3 steps)
- When only needing to mark task completion status
- Purely informational inquiries or conversations
- Trivial tasks that can be completed directly

## Best Practices
1. When creating a plan, the first task is automatically set to `in_progress`
2. Ensure tasks in the plan are specific and actionable
3. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
4. Unless all tasks are completed, always maintain at least one task in `in_progress` status
5. When modifying plans, provide only the remaining tasks that need execution
6. Use descriptive and clear task names

## Internal Processing
The tool automatically converts input strings to structured format:
- Input: `["task1", "task2", "task3"]`
- Internal representation:
  [
    {"content": "task1", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"content": "task2", "status": "pending"},
    {"content": "task3", "status": "pending"}
  ]

Remember:
- For simple tasks, execute directly without calling this tool
- Use `finish_sub_plan()` function when completing tasks
- When modifying plans, only provide the tasks that need to be executed next
"""

_DEFAULT_FINISH_SUB_PLAN_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
This tool is used to mark the completion status of a subtask in an existing plan.

Functionality:
    - Marks the task with status 'in_progress' as 'done'
    - Sets the first task with status 'pending' to 'in_progress' (if one exists)

## Tool Purpose
Specifically designed to **mark the current subtask as completed** in an existing plan.

### When to Use
Use only when the current subtask is confirmed complete.

### Automatic Status Management
- `in_progress` → `done`
- First `pending` → `in_progress` (if any)

## Usage Example
Current plan status:
[
    {"content": "Research market trends", "status": "done"},
    {"content": "Analyze competitor data", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"content": "Prepare summary report", "status": "pending"}
]

After calling finish_sub_plan():
[
    {"content": "Research market trends", "status": "done"},
    {"content": "Analyze competitor data", "status": "done"},
    {"content": "Prepare summary report", "status": "in_progress"}
]

Remember:
- Only for marking completion—do not use to create or modify plans (use write_plan instead)
- Ensure the task is truly complete before calling
- No parameters needed; status transitions are handled automatically

### When to Use

"""
_PLAN_MIDDLEWARE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You can manage task plans using the following {num} tools:

## 1. write_plan: Create or Replace a Plan
- **Primary Purpose**: Generate a structured execution framework for complex tasks, or completely replace the remaining task sequence when the current plan is no longer valid.
- **When to Use**:
  - The task requires 3 or more distinct, actionable steps
  - The user explicitly requests a task list or "to-do plan"
  - The user provides multiple tasks (e.g., numbered list, comma-separated items)
  - Execution reveals fundamental flaws in the current plan, requiring a new direction
- **Input Format**: A list of task description strings, e.g., ["Analyze user needs", "Design system architecture", "Implement core module"]
- **Automatic Status Assignment**:
  - First task → `"in_progress"`
  - All subsequent tasks → `"pending"`
- **Plan Replacement Rule**: Provide **only the new tasks that should be executed next**. Do not include completed, obsolete, or irrelevant tasks.
- **Plan Quality Requirements**:
  - Tasks must be specific, actionable, and verifiable
  - Break work into logical phases (chronological or dependency-based)
  - Define clear milestones and deliverable standards
  - Avoid vague, ambiguous, or non-executable descriptions
- **Do NOT Use When**:
  - The task is simple (<3 steps)
  - The request is conversational, informational, or a one-off query
  - You only need to mark a task as complete (use `finish_sub_plan` instead)

## 2. finish_sub_plan: Mark Current Task as Complete
- **Primary Purpose**: Confirm the current `"in_progress"` task is fully done, mark it as `"done"`, and automatically promote the first `"pending"` task to `"in_progress"`.
- **Call Only If ALL Conditions Are Met**:
  - The subtask has been **fully executed**
  - All specified requirements have been satisfied
  - There are no unresolved errors, omissions, or blockers
  - The output meets quality standards and has been verified
- **Automatic Behavior**:
  - No parameters needed—status transitions are handled internally
  - If no `"pending"` tasks remain, the plan ends naturally
- **Never Call If**:
  - The task is partially complete
  - Known issues or defects remain
  - Execution was blocked due to missing resources or dependencies
  - The result fails to meet expected quality

{read_plan_system_prompt}

## Task Status Rules (Only These Three Are Valid)
- **`"pending"`**: Task not yet started
- **`"in_progress"`**: Currently being executed (exactly one allowed at any time)
- **`"done"`**: Fully completed and verified  
> ⚠️ No other status values (e.g., "completed", "failed", "blocked") are permitted.

## General Usage Principles
1. **Execute simple tasks directly**: If a request can be fulfilled in 1–2 steps, do not create a plan—just complete it.
2. **Decompose thoughtfully**: Break complex work into clear, independent, trackable subtasks.
3. **Manage status rigorously**:
   - Always maintain exactly one `"in_progress"` task while work is ongoing
   - Call `finish_sub_plan` immediately after task completion—never delay
4. **Plan modification = full replacement**: Never edit individual tasks. To adjust the plan, use `write_plan` with a new list of remaining tasks.
5. **Respect user intent**: If the user explicitly asks for a plan—even for a simpler task—honor the request and create one.

    This middleware adds a `write_plan` and `finish_sub_plan` (and `read_plan` optional) tool that allows agents to create and manage
