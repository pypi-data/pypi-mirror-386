    """
    Create a sequential pipeline from a list of subgraphs.

    This function allows you to compose multiple StateGraphs in a sequential fashion,
    where each subgraph executes one after another. This is useful for creating
    complex multi-agent workflows where agents need to work in a specific order.

    Args:
       sub_graphs: List of sub-graphs to execute sequentially
       state_schema: state schema of the final constructed graph
       graph_name: Name of the final constructed graph
       context_schema: context schema of the final constructed graph
       input_schema: input schema of the final constructed graph
       output_schema: output schema of the final constructed graph

    Returns:
        CompiledStateGraph[StateT, ContextT, InputT, OutputT]: Compiled state graph of the pipeline.

    Example:
        Basic sequential pipeline:
        >>> from langchain_dev_utils.pipeline import sequential_pipeline
        >>> from src.graph import graph1, graph2
        >>> from src.state import State
        >>>

        ...     sub_graphs=[graph1, graph2],
        ...     state_schema=State,
        ...     graph_name="sequential graph",
