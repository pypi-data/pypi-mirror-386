_DEFAULT_WRITE_PLAN_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
A tool for writing initial plan — can only be used once, at the very beginning. 
Use update_plan for subsequent modifications.

Args:
    plan: The list of plan items to write. Each string in the list represents 
          the content of one plan item.
"""

_DEFAULT_UPDATE_PLAN_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
A tool for updating the status of plan tasks. Can be called multiple times to track task progress.

Args:
    update_plans: A list of plan items to update. Each item is a dictionary containing 
                  the following fields:
                  - content: str — The exact content of the plan task. Must match an 
                    existing task verbatim.
                  - status: str — The task status. Must be either "in_progress" or "done".

Usage Guidelines:
- Only pass the tasks whose status needs to be updated — no need to include all tasks.
- Each call must include at least one task with status "done" AND at least one task with 
  status "in_progress":
  - Mark completed tasks as "done"
  - Mark the next tasks to work on as "in_progress"
- The "content" field must exactly match the content of an existing task 
  (case-sensitive, whitespace-sensitive).

Example:
Suppose the current task list is:
- Task 1 (in_progress)
- Task 2 (pending)
- Task 3 (pending)

When "Task 1" is completed and you are ready to start "Task 2", pass in:
[
    {"content": "Task 1", "status": "done"},
    {"content": "Task 2", "status": "in_progress"}
