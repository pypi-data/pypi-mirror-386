Generating the atomic coordinates of a model of amorphous C superblock
======================================================================

In this example, we perform the "action" of generating the atomic coordinates of
a model of a :math:`25 \times 25 \times 1 \ \text{nm}^3` large superblock of
amorphous carbon (C), that is subsequently truncated to the same lateral
dimensions of a model of :math:`\text{MoS}_2` generated in another script, and
to :math:`0.5 \ \text{nm}` along the :math:`z`-axis. The superblock, prior to
truncation, is generating by tiling various transformations of a model of a
:math:`5 \times 5 \times 1 \ \text{nm}^3` large block of amorphous C. The atomic
coordinates of the :math:`5 \times 5 \times 1 \ \text{nm}^3` large block of
amorphous C were taken from Ref. [Ricolleau1]_.

NOTE: Users are advised to read the remainder of the current page in its
entirety before trying to execute this action.

To execute the action, first we need to change into the directory
``<root>/examples/modelling/cbed/simulations/amorphous_C_superblock/scripts``,
where ``<root>`` is the root of the ``emicroml`` repository. Then, we need to
run the Python script ``./execute_action.py`` via the terminal command::

  python execute_action.py --action=<action> --use_slurm=<use_slurm>

where ``<action>`` must be equal to ``generate_atomic_coords``, and
``<use_slurm>`` is either ``yes`` or ``no``. If ``<use_slurm>`` equals ``yes``
and a SLURM workload manager is available on the server from which you intend to
run the script, then the action will be performed as a SLURM job. If
``<use_slurm>`` is equal to ``no``, then the action will be performed locally
without using a SLURM workload manager.

If the action is to be performed locally without using a SLURM workload manager,
then prior to executing the above Python script, a set of Python libraries need
to be installed in the Python environment within which said Python script is to
be executed. See :ref:`this page
<examples_prerequisites_for_execution_without_slurm_sec>` for instructions on
how to do so. If the action is being performed as a SLURM job, then prior to
executing any Python commands that do not belong to Python's standard library, a
customizable sequence of commands are executed that are expected to try to
either activate an existing Python virtual environment, or create then activate
one, in which the Python libraries needed to complete the action successfully
are installed. See :ref:`this page
<examples_prerequisites_for_execution_with_slurm_sec>` for instructions how to
customize the sequence of commands.

We assume that the C atoms are subject to room temperature, and that their
root-mean-square :math:`x`-displacement is 0.141 Ã…. This value was taken from 
Ref. [Boothroyd1]_.

The action described at the beginning of the current page takes automatically as
input data output data generated by the action described in the page
:ref:`examples_modelling_cbed_simulations_MoS2_generate_atomic_coords_sec`,
hence one must execute the latter action first, prior to the former. Upon
successful completion of the former action, the atomic coordinates of the model
of the truncated superblock of amorphous C are stored in the file at the file
path
``<root>/examples/modelling/cbed/simulations/amorphous_C_superblock/data/atomic_coords.xyz``. The
atomic coordinates file will be formatted as an atomic coordinates file that is
accepted by :mod:`prismatique`: see the description of the parameter
``atomic_coords_filename`` of the class :class:`prismatique.sample.ModelParams`
for a discussion on the correct formatting of such an atomic coordinates file.

In executing the action described at the beginning of the current page, multiple
scripts are executed. The particular scripts that are executed depend on the
command line arguments of the parent Python script introduced at the beginning
of this page. If ``<use_slurm>`` equals ``yes``, then the following scripts are
executed in the order that they appear directly below:

:download:`<root>/examples/modelling/cbed/simulations/amorphous_C_superblock/scripts/execute_action.py <../../../../../../examples/modelling/cbed/simulations/amorphous_C_superblock/scripts/execute_action.py>`
:download:`<root>/examples/modelling/cbed/simulations/amorphous_C_superblock/scripts/generate_atomic_coords/execute_all_action_steps.py <../../../../../../examples/modelling/cbed/simulations/amorphous_C_superblock/scripts/generate_atomic_coords/execute_all_action_steps.py>`
:download:`<root>/examples/modelling/cbed/simulations/amorphous_C_superblock/scripts/generate_atomic_coords/prepare_and_submit_slurm_job.sh <../../../../../../examples/modelling/cbed/simulations/amorphous_C_superblock/scripts/generate_atomic_coords/prepare_and_submit_slurm_job.sh>`
:download:`<root>/examples/modelling/cbed/simulations/amorphous_C_superblock/scripts/generate_atomic_coords/execute_main_action_steps.py <../../../../../../examples/modelling/cbed/simulations/amorphous_C_superblock/scripts/generate_atomic_coords/execute_main_action_steps.py>`

Otherwise, if ``<use_slurm>`` equals ``no``, then the third script, i.e. the one
with the basename ``prepare_and_submit_slurm_job.sh`` is not executed. See the
contents of the scripts listed above for implementation details. Lastly, if the
action is being performed as a SLURM job, then the default ``sbatch`` options,
which are specified in the file with the basename
``prepare_and_submit_slurm_job.sh``, can be overridden by following the
instructions in :ref:`this page <examples_overriding_sbatch_options_sec>`.
