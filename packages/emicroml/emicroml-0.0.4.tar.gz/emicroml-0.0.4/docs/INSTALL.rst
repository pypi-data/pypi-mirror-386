Instructions for installing and uninstalling ``emicroml``
=========================================================



Installing ``emicroml``
-----------------------

For all installation scenarios, first open up the appropriate command line
interface. On Unix-based systems, you would open a terminal. On Windows systems
you would open an Anaconda Prompt as an administrator.

Before installing ``emicroml``, it is recommended that users install ``PyTorch``
in the same environment that they intend to install ``emicroml`` according to
the instructions given `here <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_ for
their preferred PyTorch installation option.



Installing ``emicroml`` using ``pip``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing ``emicroml``, make sure that you have activated the (virtual)
environment in which you intend to install said package. After which, simply run
the following command::

  pip install emicroml

The above command will install the latest stable version of ``emicroml``.

To install the latest development version from the main branch of the `emicroml
GitHub repository <https://github.com/mrfitzpa/emicroml>`_, one must first clone
the repository by running the following command::

  git clone https://github.com/mrfitzpa/emicroml.git

Next, change into the root of the cloned repository, and then run the following
command::

  pip install .

Note that you must include the period as well. The above command executes a
standard installation of ``emicroml``.

Optionally, for additional features in ``emicroml``, one can install additional
dependencies upon installing ``emicroml``. To install a subset of additional
dependencies (along with the standard installation), run the following command
from the root of the repository::

  pip install .[<selector>]

where ``<selector>`` can be one of the following:

* ``tests``: to install the dependencies necessary for running unit tests;
* ``examples``: to install the dependencies necessary for executing files stored
  in ``<root>/examples``, where ``<root>`` is the root of the repository;
* ``docs``: to install the dependencies necessary for documentation generation;
* ``all``: to install all of the above optional dependencies.

Alternatively, one can run::

  pip install emicroml[<selector>]

elsewhere in order to install the latest stable version of ``emicroml``, along
with the subset of additional dependencies specified by ``<selector>``. Note
that the Python library ``pyprismatic>=2.0`` must be installed prior to
executing either of the last two commands with ``<selector>`` set to
``examples``. The easiest way to install this additional dependency is within a
``conda`` virtual environment, using the following command::

  conda install -y pyprismatic=*=gpu* -c conda-forge

if CUDA version >= 11 is available on your machine, otherwise users should run
instead the following command::

  conda install -y pyprismatic=*=cpu* -c conda-forge

For further discussions on running examples, see the pages
:ref:`examples_prerequisites_for_execution_without_slurm_sec` and
:ref:`examples_prerequisites_for_execution_with_slurm_sec`.



Installing ``emicroml`` using ``conda``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before proceeding, make sure that you have activated the (virtual) ``conda``
environment in which you intend to install said package. For Windows systems,
users must install ``PyTorch`` separately prior to following the remaining
instructions below.

To install ``emicroml`` using the ``conda`` package manager, run the following
command::

  conda install -c conda-forge emicroml

The above command will install the latest stable version of ``emicroml``.



Uninstalling ``emicroml``
-------------------------

If ``emicroml`` was installed using ``pip``, then to uninstall, run the
following command from the root of the repository::

  pip uninstall emicroml

If ``emicroml`` was installed using ``conda``, then to uninstall, run the
following command from the root of the repository::

  conda remove emicroml
