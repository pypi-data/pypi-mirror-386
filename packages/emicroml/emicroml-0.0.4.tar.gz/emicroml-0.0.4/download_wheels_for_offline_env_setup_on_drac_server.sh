# The current script downloads the Python wheels required to install
# ``emicroml`` and to run all of the examples in this repository, on any
# high-performance computing server belonging to Digital Alliance of Canada,
# without internet access subsequent to downloading said wheels. The correct
# form of the command to run the script is::
#
#  bash download_wheels_for_offline_env_setup_on_drac_server.sh
#
# Upon completion of the script, the wheels will be downloaded to the directory
# ``<root>/_wheels_for_offline_env_setup_on_drac_server``, where ``<root>`` is
# the root of the repository. Note that this script only needs to be executed
# once, assuming one does not modify or delete the directory
# ``<root>/_wheels_for_offline_env_setup_on_drac_server``.



# Get the path to the root of the repository.
cmd="realpath "$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)""

# Create directory in which to download wheels.
