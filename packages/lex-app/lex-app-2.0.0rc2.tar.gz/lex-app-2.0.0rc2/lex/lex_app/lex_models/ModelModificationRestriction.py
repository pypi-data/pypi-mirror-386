class ModelModificationRestriction(ABC):
    """
    In order to restrict updating, deleting or creating instances of a certain model M, a class (say, X) inheriting
    this class @ModelModificationRestriction has to be defined and the desired methods have to be overwritten
    (further down in these docs it is explained which methods should be overwritten depending on your needs).
    Then, an instance of class X has to be added to the desired model A as class attribute 'modification_restriction'.

    The modification restriction works as follows:
    When a user tries to update or delete an instance of the model M, it is first checked whether the user is allowed
    to do this in general by calling the method @can_modify_in_general (default: True). If this results to False,
    an error is raised. Otherwise it is checked by calling the method @can_be_modified, if the user is allowed to
    modify the certain instance specifically. Again, if this results to False, an error is raised, otherwise
    the change is performed. The mechanism works similarly for creating an instance or reading instances.
    The parameter violations of the four methods is an array, where you can add error messages that explain
    why the user cannot perform the database change. These error messages are then shown in the raised error.
