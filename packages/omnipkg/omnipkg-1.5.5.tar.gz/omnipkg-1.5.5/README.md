`omnipkg` is not just another package manager. It's an **intelligent, self-healing runtime orchestrator** that breaks the fundamental laws of Python environments. For 30 years, developers accepted that you couldn't run multiple Python versions in one script, or safely switch C-extensions like NumPy mid-execution. **Omnipkg proves this is no longer true.**

Born from a real-world nightmare‚Äîa forced downgrade that wrecked a production environment‚Äî`omnipkg` was built to solve what others couldn't: achieving perfect dependency isolation and runtime adaptability without the overhead of containers or multiple venvs.

<!-- COMPARISON_STATS_END -->

## üí° Why This Matters

**The Multi-Version Nightmare is Over**: Modern projects are messy. You need `tensorflow==2.10` for a legacy model but `tensorflow==2.15` for new training. A critical library requires `numpy==1.21` while your latest feature needs `numpy==2.0`. Traditional solutions like Docker or virtual environments force you into a painful choice: duplicate entire environments, endure slow context switching, or face crippling dependency conflicts.

**The Multi-Interpreter Wall is Gone**: Legacy codebases often require older Python versions (e.g., Django on 3.8) while modern ML demands the latest (Python 3.11+). This forces developers to constantly manage and switch between separate, isolated environments, killing productivity.

**The `omnipkg` Solution: One Environment, Infinite Python Versions & Packages, Zero Conflicts, Downtime, or Setup. Faster than UV.**

`omnipkg` doesn't just solve these problems‚Äîit makes them irrelevant.
*   **Run Concurrently:** Execute tests for Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 **at the same time, from one command, test is done in under 500ms**. No more sequential CI jobs.
*   **Switch Mid-Script:** Seamlessly use `torch==2.0.0` and `torch==2.7.1` in the same script without restarting.
*   **Instant Healing:** Recover from environment damage in microseconds, not hours.
*   **Speak Your Language:** All of this, in your native tongue.

This is the new reality: one environment, one script, everything **just works**.

## üß† Revolutionary Core Features

### 1. Multiverse Orchestration & Python Hot-Swapping [![<600ms 3 Py Interps 1 Script 1 Env](https://img.shields.io/badge/<600ms%203%20Py%20Interps%201%20Script%201%20Env-passing-success?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/multiverse_test.yml)

## The "Quantum Multiverse Warp": 3 Pythons, 1 Script, < 600ms

Our "Quantum Multiverse Warp" demo, validated live in our CI, executes a single script across three different Python interpreters and three package versions **concurrently** in the same environment. The results are not just fast; they redefine what's possible for CI/CD.

| Task (Same Script, Same Environment) | Execution Time |
| ------------------------------------ | :------------: |
| üßµ **Thread 1:** Python 3.9 + Rich 13.4.2  | ‚úÖ **579.6ms**   |
| üßµ **Thread 2:** Python 3.10 + Rich 13.6.0 | ‚úÖ **548.4ms**   |
| üßµ **Thread 3:** Python 3.11 + Rich 13.7.1 | ‚úÖ **571.8ms**   |
| üèÜ **Total Concurrent Runtime**        | **580.1ms**      |

This isn't just a speedup; it's a paradigm shift. What traditionally takes minutes with Docker or complex venv scripting, `omnipkg` accomplishes in **under 600 milliseconds**. This isn't a simulation; it's a live, production-ready capability for high-performance Python automation.

Don't believe it? See the live proof, then run **Demo 8** to experience it yourself.
```bash
uv pip install omnipkg && omnipkg demo

**Live CI Output from Multiverse Analysis:**
```bash
üöÄ Launching multiverse analysis from Python 3.11‚Ä¶

üì¶ Step 1: Swapping to Python 3.9‚Ä¶
üêç Active interpreter switched in <1 second!
‚úÖ All dependencies auto-healed
   - NumPy 1.26.4
   - SciPy 1.13.1
üß™ SciPy result: 225

üì¶ Step 2: Swapping back to Python 3.11‚Ä¶
üêç Hot-swapped Python interpreter instantly
‚úÖ TensorFlow 2.20.0 ready to go
üß™ TensorFlow prediction: SUCCESS

üåÄ SAFETY PROTOCOL: Returned to original Python 3.11 environment
```
**Key Achievement:** Total test runtime only ~10 seconds for complete multiverse analysis, with automatic healing when NumPy compatibility issues arise. Interpreter swaps finish in just 0.25 seconds!

### 2. Real-Time Auto-Healing & Environment Repair [![‚ö° Auto-Healing: 7.76x Faster than UV](https://img.shields.io/badge/‚ö°_Auto--Healing-7.76x_Faster_than_UV-gold?logo=lightning&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/old_rich_test.yml)

`omnipkg` is the first tool that **actively repairs** your environment while you work.
- **`omnipkg run`**: Our intelligent script runner detects `ModuleNotFoundError`, `AssertionError` (for version conflicts), and even NumPy C-extension failures. It then automatically creates and activates a version-specific "bubble" to heal the script, often completing the entire process **faster than other tools take to simply fail.**
- **The Ghost Hunter**: On every startup, `omnipkg` proactively scans all managed `site-packages` for corrupted installations (e.g., `~temp-name.dist-info`) left behind by failed `pip` installs and surgically removes them, preventing environment rot before it starts.

**Live CI Output from Auto-Healing:**
```bash
‚è±Ô∏è  UV run failed in: 5379.237 ms (5,379,236,666 ns)
üîç NumPy 2.0 compatibility issue detected. Auto-healing with numpy downgrade...
   - Downgrading to numpy<2.0 for compatibility
‚úÖ Using bubble: numpy-1.26.4

üöÄ Re-running with omnipkg auto-heal...
‚úÖ Script completed successfully inside omnipkg bubble.

======================================================================
üöÄ PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: UV vs OMNIPKG
======================================================================
UV Failed Run:      5379.237 ms  (5,379,236,666 ns)
omnipkg Healing:     693.212 ms  ( 693,211,844 ns)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
üéØ omnipkg is   7.76x FASTER than UV!
üí• That's   675.99% improvement!
======================================================================
```

### 3. Dynamic Package Switching [![üí• Nuclear Test: NumPy+SciPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/üí•_Nuclear_Test:NumPy+SciPy-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/numpy-scipy-c-extension-test.yml)

Switch package versions mid-script using `omnipkgLoader`, without restarting or changing environments. `omnipkg` seamlessly juggles C-extension packages like `numpy` and `scipy` in the same Python process. The loader even handles complex **nested dependency contexts**, a feat unmatched by other tools.

**Example Code:**
```python
from omnipkg.loader import omnipkgLoader
from omnipkg.core import ConfigManager # Recommended for robust path discovery

config = ConfigManager().config # Load your omnipkg config once

with omnipkgLoader("numpy==1.24.3", config=config):
    import numpy
    print(numpy.__version__)  # Outputs: 1.24.3
import numpy # Re-import/reload might be needed if numpy was imported before the 'with' block
print(numpy.__version__)  # Outputs: Original main env version (e.g., 1.26.4)
```

**Key CI Output Excerpts (Nested Loaders):**
```bash
--- Nested Loader Test ---
üåÄ Testing nested loader usage...
‚úÖ Outer context - Typing Extensions: 4.5.0
üåÄ omnipkg loader: Activating tensorflow==2.13.0...
‚úÖ Inner context - TensorFlow: 2.13.0
‚úÖ Inner context - Typing Extensions: 4.5.0
‚úÖ Nested loader test: Model created successfully
```
---

### 4. üåç Global Intelligence & AI-Driven Localization [![ü§ñ AI-Powered: 24 Languages](https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ñ_AI--Powered-24_Languages-brightgreen?logo=openai&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/language_test.yml)

`omnipkg` eliminates language barriers with advanced AI localization supporting 24+ languages, making package management accessible to developers worldwide in their native language.

**Key Features**: Auto-detection from system locale, competitive AI translation models, context-aware technical term handling, and continuous self-improvement from user feedback.

```bash
# Set language permanently
omnipkg config set language zh_CN
# ‚úÖ Language permanently set to: ‰∏≠Êñá (ÁÆÄ‰Ωì)

# Temporary language override
omnipkg --lang es install requests

# View current configuration
cat ~/.config/omnipkg/config.json
```
Zero setup required‚Äîworks in your language from first run with graceful fallbacks and clear beta transparency.

### 5. Downgrade Protection & Conflict Resolution [![üîß Simple UV Multi-Version Test](https://img.shields.io/badge/üîß_Simple_UV_Multi--Version_Test-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/test_uv_install.yml)

`omnipkg` automatically reorders installations and isolates conflicts, preventing environment-breaking downgrades.

**Example: Conflicting `torch` versions:**
```bash
omnipkg install torch==2.0.0 torch==2.7.1
```

**What happens?** `omnipkg` reorders installs to trigger the bubble creation, installs `torch==2.7.1` in the main environment, and isolates `torch==2.0.0` in a lightweight "bubble," sharing compatible dependencies to save space. No virtual environments or containers needed.

```bash
üîÑ Reordered: torch==2.7.1, torch==2.0.0
üì¶ Installing torch==2.7.1... ‚úÖ Done
üõ°Ô∏è Downgrade detected for torch==2.0.0
ü´ß Creating bubble for torch==2.0.0... ‚úÖ Done
üîÑ Restoring torch==2.7.1... ‚úÖ Environment secure
```
---

### 6. Deep Package Intelligence with Import Validation [![üîç Package Discovery Demo](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/knowledge_base_check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/knowledge_base_check.yml)
`omnipkg` goes beyond simple version tracking, building a deep knowledge base (in Redis or SQLite) for every package. In v1.5.0, this now includes **live import validation** during bubble creation.
- **The Problem:** A package can be "installed" but still be broken due to missing C-extensions or incorrect `sys.path` entries.
- **The Solution:** When creating a bubble, `omnipkg` now runs an isolated import test for every single dependency. It detects failures (e.g., `absl-py: No module named 'absl_py'`) and even attempts to automatically repair them, ensuring bubbles are not just created, but are **guaranteed to be functional.**



**Example Insight:**
```bash
omnipkg info uv
üìã KEY DATA for 'uv':
üéØ Active Version: 0.8.11
ü´ß Bubbled Versions: 0.8.10

---[ Health & Security ]---
üîí Security Issues : 0  
üõ°Ô∏è Audit Status  : checked_in_bulk
‚úÖ Importable      : True
```

| **Intelligence Includes** | **Redis/SQLite Superpowers** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| ‚Ä¢ Binary Analysis (ELF validation, file sizes) | ‚Ä¢ 0.2ms metadata lookups |
| ‚Ä¢ CLI Command Mapping (all subcommands/flags) | ‚Ä¢ Compressed storage for large data |
| ‚Ä¢ Security Audits (vulnerability scans) | ‚Ä¢ Atomic transaction safety |
| ‚Ä¢ Dependency Graphs (conflict detection) | ‚Ä¢ Intelligent caching of expensive operations |
| ‚Ä¢ Import Validation (runtime testing) | ‚Ä¢ Enables future C-extension symlinking |

### 7. Instant Environment Recovery

[![üõ°Ô∏è UV Revert Test](https://img.shields.io/badge/üõ°Ô∏è_UV_Revert_Test-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/test_uv_revert.yml)


If an external tool (like `pip` or `uv`) causes damage, `omnipkg revert` restores your environment to a "last known good" state in seconds.

**Key CI Output Excerpt:**

```bash
Initial uv version (omnipkg-installed):uv 0.8.11
$ uv pip install uv==0.7.13
 - uv==0.8.11
 + uv==0.7.13
uv self-downgraded successfully.
Current uv version (after uv's operation): uv 0.7.13

‚öñÔ∏è  Comparing current environment to the last known good snapshot...
üìù The following actions will be taken to restore the environment:
  - Fix Version: uv==0.8.11
üöÄ Starting revert operation...
‚úÖ Environment successfully reverted to the last known good state.

--- Verifying UV version after omnipkg revert ---
uv 0.8.11
```
**UV is saved, along with any deps!**

omnipkg status
# üéØ Your native Python is now managed!

# See available interpreters
omnipkg info python

# Install a new Python version if needed (requires Python >= 3.10)
omnipkg python adopt 3.10

# Hot-swap your entire shell context
omnipkg swap python 3.10
python --version  # Now Python 3.10.x
```

### Optional: Enhanced Performance with Redis
For maximum performance, install Redis:

*   **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install redis-server
    sudo systemctl enable redis && sudo systemctl start redis
    ```

*   **macOS (Homebrew)**:
    ```bash
    brew install redis && brew services start redis
    ```

*   **Windows**: Use WSL2 or Docker:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis-omnipkg redis
    ```

*   Verify Redis: `redis-cli ping` (should return `PONG`)

---

## üî¨ How It Works (Simplified Flow)

1.  **Adopt Interpreters**: On first run, `omnipkg` automatically adopts your native Python. Add more with `omnipkg python adopt <version>`.
2.  **Install Packages**: Use `omnipkg install uv==0.7.13 uv==0.7.14` or `omnipkg install -r req.txt`
3.  **Conflict Detection**: `omnipkg` spots version clashes and isolates them in bubbles.
4.  **Dynamic Package Switching**: Use `omnipkgLoader` to switch package versions mid-script.
5.  **Interpreter Hot-Swapping**: Switch your shell's active Python instantly with `omnipkg swap python <version>`.
6.  **Intelligence Database**: High-performance knowledge base built for all packages (Redis preferred, SQLite fallback).
7.  **Auto-healing**: `omnipkg run` automatically fixes compatibility issues in real-time.
8.  **Atomic Snapshots**: Instant rollback with `omnipkg revert`.

**Example: Safe Flask-Login Downgrade:**
```bash
omnipkg install flask-login==0.4.1
```
```bash
üì∏ Taking LIVE pre-installation snapshot...
üõ°Ô∏è DOWNGRADE PROTECTION ACTIVATED!
-> Detected conflict: flask-login v0.6.3 ‚Üí v0.4.1
ü´ß Creating bubble for flask-login v0.4.1... ‚úÖ Done
üîÑ Restoring flask-login v0.6.3... ‚úÖ Environment secure
```

Verify:
```bash
omnipkg info flask-login
```
```bash
üìã flask-login STATUS:
üéØ Active: 0.6.3 (main)
ü´ß Available: 0.4.1 (bubble)
üìä Space Saved: 55.5%
```
You now have both versions available in one environment, ready for use anytime!
