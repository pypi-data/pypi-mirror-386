## How to install

<a id="generate-locally-(recommended)"></a>

### Generate locally (recommended)

You can generate type annotations for `boto3` package locally with
`mypy-boto3-builder`. Use
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for build
isolation.

1. Run mypy-boto3-builder in your package root directory:
   `uvx --with 'boto3==1.40.59' mypy-boto3-builder`
2. Select `boto3-stubs` AWS SDK.
3. Add all available services.
4. Use provided commands to install generated packages.

<a id="vscode-extension"></a>

### VSCode extension

Add
[AWS Boto3](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Boto3typed.boto3-ide)
extension to your VSCode and run `AWS boto3: Quick Start` command.

Click `Auto-discover services` and select services you use in the current
project.

<a id="from-pypi-with-pip"></a>

### From PyPI with pip

Install `boto3-stubs-full` to add type checking for `boto3` package.

```bash
# install type annotations
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[full]'

# or install annotations in sync with boto3 version
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[full,boto3]'
```

<a id="how-to-uninstall"></a>

## How to uninstall

```bash
# uninstall boto3-stubs
python -m pip uninstall -y boto3-stubs-full boto3-stubs
```

<a id="usage"></a>

## Usage

<a id="vscode"></a>

### VSCode

- Install
  [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- Install
  [Pylance extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- Set `Pylance` as your Python Language Server
- Install `boto3-stubs-full` in your environment:

```bash
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[full]'
```

Both type checking and code completion should now work. No explicit type
annotations required, write your `boto3` code as usual.

<a id="pycharm"></a>

### PyCharm

> ⚠️ Due to slow PyCharm performance on `Literal` overloads (issue
> [PY-40997](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-40997)), it is recommended
> to use [boto3-stubs-lite](https://pypi.org/project/boto3-stubs-lite/) until
> the issue is resolved.

> ⚠️ If you experience slow performance and high CPU usage, try to disable
> `PyCharm` type checker and use [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) or
> [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) instead.

> ⚠️ To continue using `PyCharm` type checker, you can try to replace
> `boto3-stubs` with
> [boto3-stubs-lite](https://pypi.org/project/boto3-stubs-lite/):

```bash
python -m pip uninstall -y boto3-stubs
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs-lite[full]'
```

Install `boto3-stubs-lite` in your environment:

```bash
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs-lite[full]'
```

Both type checking and code completion should now work.

<a id="emacs"></a>

### Emacs

- Install `boto3-stubs-full` in your environment:

```bash
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[full]'
```

- Install [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package),
  [lsp](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/),
  [company](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode) and
  [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) packages
- Install [lsp-pyright](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-pyright) package

```elisp
(use-package lsp-pyright
  :ensure t
  :hook (python-mode . (lambda ()
                          (require 'lsp-pyright)
                          (lsp)))  ; or lsp-deferred
  :init (when (executable-find "python3")
          (setq lsp-pyright-python-executable-cmd "python3"))
  )
```

- Make sure emacs uses the environment where you have installed
  `boto3-stubs-full`

Type checking should now work. No explicit type annotations required, write
your `boto3` code as usual.

<a id="sublime-text"></a>

### Sublime Text

- Install `boto3-stubs-full` in your environment:

```bash
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[full]'
```

- Install [LSP-pyright](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-pyright) package

Type checking should now work. No explicit type annotations required, write
your `boto3` code as usual.

<a id="other-ides"></a>

### Other IDEs

Not tested, but as long as your IDE supports `mypy` or `pyright`, everything
should work.

<a id="mypy"></a>

### mypy

- Install `mypy`: `python -m pip install mypy`
- Install `boto3-stubs-full` in your environment:

```bash
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[full]'
```

Type checking should now work. No explicit type annotations required, write
your `boto3` code as usual.

<a id="pyright"></a>

### pyright

- Install `pyright`: `npm i -g pyright`
- Install `boto3-stubs-full` in your environment:

```bash
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[full]'
```

Optionally, you can install `boto3-stubs-full` to `typings` directory.

Type checking should now work. No explicit type annotations required, write
your `boto3` code as usual.

<a id="pylint-compatibility"></a>

### Pylint compatibility

It is totally safe to use `TYPE_CHECKING` flag in order to avoid
`boto3-stubs-full` dependency in production. However, there is an issue in
`pylint` that it complains about undefined variables. To fix it, set all types
to `object` in non-`TYPE_CHECKING` mode.

```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from mypy_boto3_ec2 import EC2Client, EC2ServiceResource
    from mypy_boto3_ec2.waiters import BundleTaskCompleteWaiter
    from mypy_boto3_ec2.paginators import DescribeVolumesPaginator
else:
    EC2Client = object
    EC2ServiceResource = object
    BundleTaskCompleteWaiter = object
    DescribeVolumesPaginator = object

...
```

<a id="explicit-type-annotations"></a>

### Explicit type annotations

To speed up type checking and code completion, you can set types explicitly.

```python
import boto3
from boto3.session import Session

from mypy_boto3_ec2.client import EC2Client
from mypy_boto3_ec2.service_resource import EC2ServiceResource
from mypy_boto3_ec2.waiter import BundleTaskCompleteWaiter
from mypy_boto3_ec2.paginator import DescribeVolumesPaginator

session = Session(region_name="us-west-1")

ec2_client: EC2Client = boto3.client("ec2", region_name="us-west-1")
ec2_resource: EC2ServiceResource = session.resource("ec2")

bundle_task_complete_waiter: BundleTaskCompleteWaiter = ec2_client.get_waiter(
    "bundle_task_complete"
)
describe_volumes_paginator: DescribeVolumesPaginator = ec2_client.get_paginator("describe_volumes")
```

<a id="how-it-works"></a>

## How it works

Fully automated
[mypy-boto3-builder](https://github.com/youtype/mypy_boto3_builder) carefully
generates type annotations for each service, patiently waiting for `boto3`
updates. It delivers drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:

- All available `boto3` services are covered.
- Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type
  annotations extracted from `botocore` schemas.
- Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.
- Link to documentation is provided for every method.
- Code is processed by [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for readability.
