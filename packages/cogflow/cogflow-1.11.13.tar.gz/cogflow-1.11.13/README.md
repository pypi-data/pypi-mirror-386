
# CogFlow

Cogflow module sets up a pipeline for handling datasets and machine learning models
using multiple plugins. It includes functions for creating, registering, evaluating,
and serving models, as well as managing datasets.

**Key components include:**

Mlflow Plugin: For model tracking, logging, and evaluation.
Kubeflow Plugin: For pipeline management and serving models.
Dataset Plugin: For dataset registration and management.
Model Plugin: For saving model details.
Configurations: Constants for configuration like tracking URIs, database credentials, etc.

**Key Functions:**

**Model Management**

register_model: Register a new model.
log_model: Log a model.
load_model: Load a model.
delete_registered_model: Delete a registered model.
create_registered_model: Create a new registered model.
create_model_version: Create a new version of a registered model.


**Run Management**

start_run: Start a new.
end_run: End the current.
log_param: Log a parameter to the current run.
log_metric: Log a metric to the current run.


**Evaluation and Autologging**

evaluate: Evaluate a model.
autolog: Enable automatic logging of parameters, metrics, and models.


**Search and Query**

search_registered_models: Search for registered models.
search_model_versions: Search for model versions.
get_model_latest_version: Get the latest version of a registered model.
get_artifact_uri: Get the artifact URI of the current or specified run.


**Dataset Management**

link_model_to_dataset: Link a model to a dataset.
save_dataset_details: Save dataset details.
save_model_details_to_db: Save model details to the database.


**Pipeline and Component Management**

pipeline: Create a new Kubeflow pipeline.
create_component_from_func: Create a Kubeflow component from a function.
client: Get the Kubeflow client.
load_component_from_url: Load a Kubeflow component from a URL.


**Model Serving**

serve_model_v1: Serve a model using Kubeflow V1.
serve_model_v2: Serve a model using Kubeflow V2.
get_model_url: Get the URL of a served model.
delete_served_model: Delete a served model.


**MinIO Operations**

create_minio_client: Create a MinIO client.
query_endpoint_and_download_file: Query an endpoint and download a file from MinIO.
save_to_minio: Save file content to MinIO.
delete_from_minio: Delete an object from MinIO.


**Dataset Registration**

register_dataset: Register a dataset.
