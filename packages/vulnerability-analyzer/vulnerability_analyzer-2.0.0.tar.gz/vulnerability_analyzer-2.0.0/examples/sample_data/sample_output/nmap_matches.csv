while ftrace is looping over a list of addresses to patch, it always failed
when patching the same function: riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask. looking at the
backtrace, the illegal instruction is encountered in this same function.
however, patch_text_nosync, after patching the instructions, calls
flush_icache_range. but looking at what happens in this function:

flush_icache_range -> flush_icache_all
                   -> sbi_remote_fence_i
                   -> __sbi_rfence_v02
                   -> riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask

the icache and dcache of the current cpu are never synchronized between the
patching of riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask and calling this same function.

so fix this by flushing the current cpu's icache before asking for the other
cpus to do the same.",CVE-2021-47414

mac80211-hwsim: fix late beacon hrtimer handling

thomas explained in https://lore.kernel.org/r/87mtoeb4hb.ffs@tglx
that our handling of the hrtimer here is wrong: if the timer fires
late (e.g. due to vcpu scheduling, as reported by dmitry/syzbot)
then it tries to actually rearm the timer at the next deadline,
which might be in the past already:

 1          2          3          n          n+1
 |          |          |   ...    |          |

 ^ intended to fire here (1)
            ^ next deadline here (2)
                                      ^ actually fired here

the next time it fires, it's later, but will still try to schedule
for the next deadline (now 3), etc. until it catches up with n,
but that might take a long time, causing stalls etc.

now, all of this is simulation, so we just have to fix it, but
note that the behaviour is wrong even per spec, since there's no
value then in sending all those beacons unaligned - they should be
aligned to the tbtt (1, 2, 3, ... in the picture), and if we're a
bit (or a lot) late, then just resume at that point.

therefore, change the code to use hrtimer_forward_now() which will
ensure that the next firing of the timer would be at n+1 (in the
picture), i.e. the next interval point after the current time.",CVE-2021-47396
