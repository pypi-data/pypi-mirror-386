        # Rationals

        * Macros are executed strictly in order, in the md content, which allows to assign
          unambiguously a global order fo all the running elements.
        * @group_id (coming from the `RUN_GROUP` argument) allows to tell what elements are
          in the same group, or what elements to "SKIP".
        * Inside a group, the user needs a way to pick the element that has priority over
          the others, when nothing has been run in one group yet. This is then "overridden"
          by the users actions (when they are using another element in the group).
        * By default, any new element is alone in its own group.


        # Implementation

        Returning a pair `List[int,int]: [group_number_in_page, number_in_group]`.
        `number_in_group` is 0 for the runner with priority (if any, defined by the user), or a
        positive number.

        | `[n_group_id, 0]` | If `RUN_GROUP` is a string with a "star" character: `f"*?{ str }*?`. |
