    Most/some docs strings will be used inside cells of tables, so the md cannot be "multiline"

    readable in the declaring code, the following logic is always applied:

    1. Consider the declaration is done with python multiline strings in the python code.
    2. `dedent` the content.
    3. Strip the message from leading and trailing new lines.
    4. Inline every "paragraph" by removing all "\\n\\s*" except when they are preceded by
        another "\\n" (which means it's the beginning of a new Â§, potentially with indentation).

    If @in_cell is True, replaces automatically any remaining new line character with `"<br>"`,
    to avoid breaking markdown tables.

    If @validate is True, the resulting markdown, is parsed by an IndentParser object, to get
    some level of insurance that there are no quotes syntaxes troubles or so (otherwise, mistakes
    are almost impossible to spot in the config...).
