# Extractor general contracts/logic:
------------------------------------


Represent all the files associated to a runner (IDE, terminal, ...), holding the logic/tools
to build the various sections contents.

Context/Contracts/Goals:

* An Extractor is linked to a single PMT file, with its potential "direct" dependencies
(aka REMs, or tests/corr files par for the PM source project's format).

* The PMT file can actually not exist at all! (in that case, exo_py is None)

* A PMT file, if it exists, contains sections, delimited by tokens in the form:
        `{something} (PMT|PYODIDE):{section} {something}`
`something` being different depending on what is the file to extract (python, sql, ...).
.
* An Extractor instance is cached based on the absolute/resolved path to the main file
(self.exo_py).

* The cache is automatically refreshed when a local file has been modified (based on the
stats of the file). NOTE: this update is done at the on_config step, to avoid checking on
each extractor use/call.

* The contents of the files are stored in the instance, avoiding multiple HDD reads operations.

* Inclusions instructions are gathered after the file content has been read, WITHOUT recursively
triggering extraction of successors: these will be resolved on demand, when building contents.
NOTE: this is to allow .snippets.py file containing multiple sections, some of them not being
used in the "parent" file. These .snippets.py files often using [py] redirections, forcing the
resolution of the children might cause crashes if some sections of the .snippets.py file would
require specific content in the parent file while they aren't actually needed for this file.

* The final/actual contents are never stored in the object: sections (inclusions) are rebuilt
on the fly each time they are needed (relying on the fact reading a file is longer than string
concatenations, and that the simplification this allows in the implementation compensate for
the extra computation time).
