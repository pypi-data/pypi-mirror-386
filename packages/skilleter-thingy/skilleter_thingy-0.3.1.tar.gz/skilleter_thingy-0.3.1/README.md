A collection of shell utilities and configuration stuff for Linux and MacOS. Untested on other operating systems.

Permanently (for the foreseeable future!) in a beta stage - usable, with a few rough edges, and probably with bugs when used in way I'm not expecting!

Install from PyPi via pip or pipx as the `skilleter-thingy` package; for instance - `pipx install skilleter_thingy`

The commands are categorised into:

* Git working tree management
* Miscellaneous commands
* Git Extensions
* General-purpose commands

# Git Working Tree Management

## Multigit

Multigit is a tool for managing a collection of related git working trees.

This is intended for use in a situation where you have a collection of related git working trees organised in a directory hierarchy which aren't managed using git submodules or any other tool. It allows you to run git commands on multiple working trees at once, without navigating around the different working trees to do so and to select which working trees commands are run in.

For ease of use it is recommended that you create an alias for multigit called `mg`. How you do this is dependent on the shell you use, for instance in Bash, you could create an alias in your `~/.bashrc` file:

    alias mg="multigit $@"

### Initialisation

To use multigit, start by creating working trees for the repositories that you want to use in a directory tree - the working trees can be at different levels or even nested, for example:

    multigit_tree
    |
    +----working tree 1
    |
    +---+subdirectory
    |   |
    |   +----working tree 2
    |   |
    |   +----working tree 3
    |
    +----working tree 4

Start by running ensuring that the default branch (e.g. `main`) is checked out in each of the working trees and, in the top-level directory, run `multigit init` to create the configuration file which, by default is called `multigit.toml` - this is just a text file that sets the configuration for each working tree in terms of name, origin, default branch, tags and location.

### Multigit Command Line

The multigit command line format is:

    multigit OPTIONS COMMAND

Where COMMAND is an internal multigit command if it starts with a `+` and is a git command otherwise (including the additional git commands described in this document).

By default, when multigit is invoked with a git command, it runs a the command in each of the working trees selected by the command line options passed to multigit (if no options are specified then the command is run in *all* the working trees.

The command takes a number of options that can be used to select the list of working trees that each of the subcommands that it supports runs in:

`--repos REPO` / `-r REPO` Allows a list of working trees to be specfied, either by path, name or a wildcard matching either.

`--modified` / `-m` Run only in working trees containing locally modified files

`--branched` / `-b` Run only in working trees where the current branch that is checked out is NOT the default branch

`--tag TAG` / `-t TAG` Run only in working trees that are tagged with the specified tag

`--sub` / `-s` Run only in working trees that are in the current directory tree.

`--continue` / `-o` Continue if a git command returns an error (by default, executation terminates when a command fails)

`--path PATH` / `-C PATH` Run as if the command was started in PATH instead of the current working directory

These options are AND-ed together, so specifying `--modified --branched --tag WOMBAT` will select only working trees that are modified AND branched AND tagged with `WOMBAT`, but the parameters to the `--repos` and `--tag` options are OR-ed together, so specifying `--tag WOMBAT --tag EMU` will select repos that are tagged as `WOMBAT` *OR* `EMU`.

Multigit tags are stored in the configuration file, not within the working tree and each working tree can have multiple tags.

### Multigit Commands

Multigit supports a small list of subcommands, each of which are prefixed with a `+` to distinguish them from Git commands:

`+clone REPO <BRANCH>` - Clone REPO (which should contain a multigit configuration file), checking out BRANCH, if specified, then clone all the repos specified in the configuration, checking out the default branch in each one.

`+init` - Create or update the configuration file

`+dir NAME` - Given the name of a working tree, output relative path(s) to one or more matching working trees. If `NAME` does NOT contains wildcard characters (`*` or `?`) then matching takes place as if `*` were prefixed and appended to it, otherwise, the wildcards are used as specified. If `NAME` is not specified then the location of the directory where the multigit configuration file resides is output.

`+list` - Return a list of the top level directories of each of the Git repos

`+config` - Print the name and location of the multigit configuration file.

`+tag TAG` - If no tag specified list tags applied to the specified working trees. If a tag *is* specified, then *apply* the tag to the specified working trees.

`+untag TAG` - Remove the tag from the specified working trees (do nothing if the tag is not applied in the first place).

`+run COMMAND` - Run the specified command in each of the specified working trees

`+add REPO DIR` - Clone REPO into the DIR directory and, if successful, add it to the multigit configuration

Any command *not* prefixed with `+` is run in each of the working trees (filtered by the various multigit options) as a git command.

For example; `multigit -m commit -ab` would run `git commit -a` in each of the working trees that is branched and contains modified files.

The `+dir` command can be used with shell aliases (or their equivalent in the user's shell of choice) to create an alias to run, for example, `cd (multigit +dir "$@")` (Bash) or `cd (multigit +dir $argv)` (for the Fish shell) that would cd to the top level directory.

# Miscellaneous Git Utilities

## gitprompt

Output a string containing colour-coded shell nesting level, current directory and git working tree status. It is intended to be used in the shell prompt; for instance, for Bash via adding:

    export PS1=$(gitprompt)

to the `~/.bashrc` file.

The appearance of the prompt is controlled by configuration settings in the `.gitconfig` file:

    [prompt]
    prefix = 0..2

The `prefix` value determines what git status information is shown in the prompt:

* 0 - No status information
* 1 - A single letter followed by a file count showing the number of stashed, untracked, modified, etc. files in the working tree
* 2 - As 1, but using a word, rather than a single letter

If a rebase, bisect or merge is process, this is also shown in the prompt.

The name of the repo and the current branch are also appended and the prompt is also colour-coded according to the state of the working tree.

# Git Extensions

Due to the way that the git command works, these can be run as they were additional git subcommands, although, due to a limitation in git, the only things that does not work is the `--help` option where the command has to be run with a hyphen between `git` and the subcommand - for example `git ca --help` does not work, but `git-ca --help` does.

## Branch Names

Where one of the git extensions takes an existing branch name as a parameter, the branch name can be abbreviated and the abbreviated form is expanded according to the following rules:

* If the specified branch name exactly matches an existing branch, tag or commit ID then that is used (this includes remote branches where appropriate, if no local branches match).
* Otherwise, the branch name is compared to existing branches (again, including remote branches where appropriate, if no local branches match) and, if the specified name uniquely partially matches an existing branch (optionally using `*` and `?` wildcard characters) that branch is used. If it matches multiple branches than an error is reported.

For example, given a repo with the following branches:

        origin/wombat
        origin/platypus
        wombat
        emu
        battery
        chaos

Then:

* 'emu' will match 'emu'
* 'wombat' will match 'wombat' but not 'origin/wombat' since the local branch takes precedence
* 'at' will match both 'wombat' and 'battery' and will report an error
* 'pus' will match 'origin/platypus'

This is most useful where branches contain ticket numbers so, for instance given a branch called `feature/SKIL-103` you can check it out using `git co 103` assuming no other local branches contain `103` in their name.

Note that the concept of the default branch `DEFAULT` mentioned above *only* applies when using the `multigit` command, although some of the commands will treat branches called `master` or `main` as special cases (see the individual command documentation).
