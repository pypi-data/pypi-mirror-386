# rich-tree-cli

## Tasks

- [x] Add support for passing a `.gitignore` file using custom ignore patterns in the ignore handler.
- [x] Implement a feature to handle `.gitignore` files in the ignore handler.
- [x] Add output features beyond just basic plaintext output.
- [x] Markdown output format
- [x] HTML output format
- [x] JSON output format
- [x] Add SVG output format support
- [ ] Options to sort by: name, version,size, mtime, ctime
- [ ] Finish adding icons
- [ ] Need to add "plain" icons
- [ ] Clean up the HTML output, it is very messy but very awesome!
- [x] Add XML output format support
- [x] Add YAML output format support
- [x] Add TOML output format support (TOML support partially added, but needs a lot of work) # We need tomlkit since it is so more expressive
- [ ] Add a Directory only option
- [ ] Add a `--no-report` option to disable the report at the end of the output
- [ ] Add a `--file-limit` option to limit the number of files displayed in the output
- [ ] Add symbolic link following support
- [ ] Finish adding output replacement support (where content in between tags is replaced with the output of the command)
- [ ] Improve how outputs are structured (to minimize the amount of places where things need to be updated to add new output formats)
