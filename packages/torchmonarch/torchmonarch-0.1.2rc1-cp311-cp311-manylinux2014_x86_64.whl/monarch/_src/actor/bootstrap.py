    Start a monarch server at "address" capable of letting this machine participate in
    a monarch process.

    address is a zmq-style specifier for the place where the server will listen to connections, examples:

        tcp://*:4444 - listen on tcp port (NYI, use tls on connection when ca="trust_all_connections")
        metatls://*:4444 - listen on tcp port use ssl encryption via metatls
        ipc://some_unique_string - unix sockets
        inproc://3423 - connection only accessible within the process


    The server will accept a connection to a new root client and enable it to
    use this machine as a host. If the client disconnects or cannot be contacted, this server
    kills all the current work and waits for a new connection.


    private_key is a tls private key file loaded as bytes used to establish secure connections.
    Things connecting to this machine must trust this private_key in the certificate authority file.

    ca is a certificate authority key file. This worker will only trust incoming connections with
    keys that are trusted by the ca.

    We can defer implementing authentication for a bit, but for any open source release, anyone
    is going to worry about worker machines opening unencrypted ports and waiting for connections
    on a service that evals python code, so we should just build it in.

    used to decide if we have successfully connected to all hosts. Workers are specified with the same zmq-style
