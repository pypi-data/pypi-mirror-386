# {{project_name_title}}

An experimental Nexios application showcasing cutting-edge features and real-time capabilities.

## Experimental Features

- üöÄ GraphQL API with Strawberry
- üîÑ WebSocket support for real-time updates
- üì° Event-driven architecture
- üíæ Advanced caching system
- üóÑÔ∏è Async database integration
- üìö Auto-generated API documentation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
   Or using the Nexios CLI:
   ```bash
   nexios run
   ```

3. Access the APIs:
   - REST API: http://localhost:4000/docs
   - GraphQL Playground: http://localhost:4000/graphql
   - WebSocket: ws://localhost:4000/ws

## API Interfaces

### REST Endpoints

- `GET /`: Welcome message
- `GET /items`: List all items
- `GET /items/{item_id}`: Get a specific item
- `POST /items`: Create a new item
- `DELETE /items/{item_id}`: Delete an item
- `GET /events/{event_type}`: Server-Sent Events endpoint

### GraphQL API

Access the GraphQL playground at `/graphql` to explore the schema and execute queries:

```graphql
query {
  items {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

### WebSocket Events

Connect to the WebSocket endpoint at `/ws` to receive real-time updates:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:4000/ws');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log('Received:', event.data);
};
```

## Real-time Features

The application demonstrates several real-time capabilities:

1. WebSocket Broadcasting:
   - Item updates are broadcast to all connected clients
   - Real-time statistics updates
   - System notifications

2. Server-Sent Events:
   - Continuous data streaming
   - Live metrics
   - Activity feed

3. Event System:
   - Pub/Sub architecture
   - Custom event channels
   - Event filtering and routing

## Development

For development with hot-reload:

```bash
nexios run --reload
```

### Project Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py           # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt  # Project dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # Documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore       # Git ignore file
```

## Performance Tips

1. WebSocket Connections:
   - Implement heartbeat mechanism
   - Handle reconnection gracefully
   - Use connection pooling

2. GraphQL Optimization:
   - Enable query batching
   - Implement DataLoader
   - Use field-level caching

3. Event System:
   - Configure appropriate buffer sizes
   - Implement back-pressure handling
   - Monitor event queue sizes

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

This template includes experimental features that may change in future versions. It's recommended to:

- Review the documentation for each experimental feature
- Test thoroughly before production use
- Monitor performance metrics
- Keep dependencies updated
