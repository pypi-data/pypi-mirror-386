## Motivation
Nexios was created out of a desire to make web development in Python faster, cleaner, and more enjoyable. The Python ecosystem already offers incredible frameworks, each with its own strengths and communities, but we saw an opportunity to build something that combines performance, simplicity, and flexibility in a fresh way.

Inspired by the developer experience found in ecosystems like Node.js and Go, Nexios aims to bring that same level of speed and modern design philosophy to Python while keeping things readable and developer-friendly.

Built on top of ASGI, Nexios delivers high performance and true asynchronous support right out of the box. It is designed to handle demanding workloads, scale efficiently, and remain easy to work with, whether you are building APIs, real-time systems, or full-featured web apps.

Beyond performance, Nexios focuses on developer experience. It provides a clean and intuitive API that is easy to learn yet powerful enough for complex projects. Its modular architecture allows developers to extend and customize components effortlessly, making it adaptable for a wide range of use cases.

Nexios is not here to replace existing frameworks. It is here to give developers another optionâ€”one that emphasizes speed, flexibility, and simplicity in a way that feels modern and empowering.
