## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please report any unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip
- Node.js (for documentation development)
- Git

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexios.git
   cd nexios
   ```
3. **Set up a virtual environment** and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Using UV (recommended)
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   
   # Or using pip
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
4. **Install Node.js dependencies** for documentation:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - The main branch. All production-ready code goes here.
- `develop` - The development branch. All feature branches should be merged here first.
- `feature/` - For new features.
- `bugfix/` - For bug fixes.
- `docs/` - For documentation improvements.

### Code Style and Formatting

Nexios follows strict code style guidelines. We use:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **Ruff** for linting

Before committing, run:

```bash
black .
isort .
ruff check . --fix
```

### Testing

We use `pytest` and `tox` for testing. To run the test suite:

```bash
# Run tests with pytest directly
pytest

# Or use tox to test across multiple Python versions
tox
```

For test coverage:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report -m
```

### Documentation

Documentation is built using VitePress. To work on the documentation:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run docs:dev
   ```
   This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:5173`

2. To build the documentation for production:
   ```bash
   npm run docs:build
   ```

3. To preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run docs:preview
   ```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them following the [commit message format](#commit-message-format).

3. Push your branch and create a Pull Request (PR) to the `develop` branch.

4. Ensure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.

5. Request a review from one of the maintainers.

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Example:
```
feat(router): add support for dynamic route parameters

- Added support for path parameters in route definitions
- Updated router to handle dynamic segments
- Added relevant tests
```

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nexios-labs/nexios/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include:

- A clear title and description
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment details (Python version, OS, etc.)
- Any relevant logs or error messages

## Asking Questions

For questions and discussions, please:

1. Check the [documentation](https://nexios-docs.netlify.app/)
2. Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/nexios-labs/nexios/issues)
3. If you still can't find an answer, open a new discussion or issue

## Development Tips

- **Using UV**: Nexios recommends using UV for faster dependency management. After installing UV, you can use it as a drop-in replacement for pip:
  ```bash
  uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
  ```

- **Running Tests with Tox**: To ensure compatibility across Python versions, use tox:
  ```bash
  # Run tests on all configured Python versions
  tox
  
  # Run tests for a specific Python version
  tox -e py39  # For Python 3.9
  ```

- **Documentation Development**: When working on documentation, the VitePress dev server provides hot-reloading. Just run `npm run docs:dev` and start editing the markdown files in the `docs` directory.

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: The project includes pre-commit hooks that automatically format and check your code. Install them with `pre-commit install`.
