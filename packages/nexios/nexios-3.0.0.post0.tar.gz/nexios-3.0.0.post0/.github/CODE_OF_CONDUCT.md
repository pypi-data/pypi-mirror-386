- Showing empathy toward other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at nexioslabs@proton.me. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
