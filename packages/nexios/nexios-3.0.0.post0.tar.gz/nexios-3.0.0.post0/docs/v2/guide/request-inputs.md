## Determining Request Input Types

Nexios provides convenient properties to quickly determine the type of incoming request data, making it easier to handle different input formats:

```python
@app.post("/handle-input")
async def handle_input(req, res):
    # Check content type and handle accordingly
    if req.is_json:
        data = await req.json
        return {"type": "json", "data": data}

    elif req.is_form:
        data = await req.form
        return {"type": "form", "data": data}

    elif req.is_multipart:
        files = await req.files
        return {"type": "multipart", "files": len(files)}

    else:
        # Handle other types or return error
        return {"error": "Unsupported content type"}, 400
```

### Available Request Type Flags

| Property | Description | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `req.is_json` | Content-Type is `application/json` | JSON API requests |
| `req.is_form` | Content-Type is form data | HTML forms |
| `req.is_multipart` | Content-Type is `multipart/form-data` | File uploads |
| `req.is_urlencoded` | Content-Type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | Simple forms |
| `req.has_files` | Request contains uploaded files | File processing |
| `req.has_body` | Request has a body | Input validation |

## JSON Data 

To handle JSON data in a request, you can use the `json` property of the `Request` object. This property asynchronously parses the request body as JSON and returns it as a dictionary.



```python
from nexios import NexiosApp

app = NexiosApp()

@app.post("/submit")
async def submit_data(req, res):
    data = await req.json
    return {"received": data}
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡Tip
Nexios only process `application/json` content types for JSON data.
:::

## Form Data

Nexios provides built-in support for parsing form data, including `multipart/form-data` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You can access the parsed form data using the `form_data` property of the `Request` object.

**Example**

```python
@app.post("/submit-form")
async def submit_form(req, res):
    form_data = await req.form_data
    return {"received": form_data}
```



## Handling File Uploads

When handling file uploads, the `form_data` property also provides access to the uploaded files. You can iterate over the form data to extract files.


```python
@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(req, res):
    files = await req.files
    for name, file in files.items():
        # Process the uploaded file
        pass
    return {"status": "files received"}
```



## Handling Streaming Request Data

For large payloads or real-time data, you might need to handle streaming request data. Nexios supports streaming data using the `req.stream` property.



```python
@app.post("/stream")
async def stream_data(req, res):
    data = b""
    async for chunk in req.stream():
        data += chunk
    print(data.decode())
    return {"status": "stream received"}
```

## Validating Inputs

Nexios integrates with Pydantic for input validation. You can define Pydantic models to validate and parse request data.

**Example**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, ValidationError

class UserSchema(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr

@app.post("/create-user")
async def create_user(req, res):
    try:
        user_data = await req.json
        user = UserSchema(**user_data)
        return res.json({"user": user.dict()})
    except ValidationError as e:
        return res.json({"error": e.errors()}, status_code=422)
```
