-----

Log your time to tempo on a self-hosted Jira instance and get relevant insights into your logged time per project from the convenience of your command line.

## Requirements

This tool is developed against

- Jira Server v9.4.17
- Tempo Timesheets 17.2.0 plugin

Any deviation from that setup might lead to issues.
Feel free to provide PRs to support other configurations.

## Installation

```console
pip install log-time-to-tempo
```

## Getting Started

To initialize authentication and local caches of projects and issues, run

```
lt init
```

If you want to enable shell completion (which makes picking issues much easier), run

```
lt --install-completion
```

## Usage

### Log Time

```sh
# log full workday to default issue
lt log
# log 2h to default issue
lt log 2h
# log 2h to specific issue
lt log 2h TSI-1
# log with custom message
lt log -m "working on foo" 2h TSI-1
# log multiple entries at once
lt logm MyProject:6,OPT:2
```

### Check Logged Time

```sh
# show logged time per issue
lt stats
# show logged time per issue for current month
lt stats month
# ..also show individual worklogs
lt stats -v
```

The `stats` command includes sparkline visualizations with axis information to help you understand when you started logging time for each project:

- **Yearly ranges** (e.g., `year`, `last_year`): Show month abbreviations (Jan, Feb, Mar, ...)
- **Monthly ranges** (e.g., `month`, `last_30_days`): Show week numbers (W1, W2, W3, ...)
- **Weekly ranges** (e.g., `week`, `last_7_days`): Show no axis labels to reduce clutter

### Check Budget (i.e. logged and remaining time per person)

```sh
# show remaining time for last booked issue (auto-selected)
lt budget
# show remaining time for specific issue
lt budget TS-XXXXX
```

### Set Aliases

```sh
# set alias name for a commonly used issue
lt alias TSI-7 OPT
lt alias TS-10402 ProjectName
# unset aliases
lt alias --unset ProjectName
# show all aliases
lt alias
```

## Configuration

The `lt config` command allows to change the default behavior, either system wide (`--system`) or in the local directory and subdirectories.

Here are a couple of usage examples:

```sh
# Set custom jira instance for all projects (i.e. system-wide)
lt config --system JIRA_INSTANCE https://jira.my-server.com

# Set default issue for worklogs created from current directory (and subdirectories)
lt config LT_LOG_ISSUE TSI-7

# Start all your worklogs at 10am (instead of the default 9am)
lt config --system LT_LOG_START 10

# Remove all custom configuration
lt config --unset
```

- add axis to `stats` sparklines to indicate time periods
- `budget` command automatically selects the most recent issue when no issue is specified
- fix output of `stats -v` command (dim worklog comments, show day/time correctly, normalize sparkline height to 0-8)

### [0.0.8] - 2025-07-09

[0.0.8]: https://github.com/jannismain/log-time-to-tempo/releases/tag/v0.0.8

- `stats` command includes sparkline visualizations to show daily time patterns

### [0.0.7] - 2025-04-10

[0.0.7]: https://github.com/jannismain/log-time-to-tempo/releases/tag/v0.0.7

### [0.0.6] - 2025-03-20

[0.0.6]: https://github.com/jannismain/log-time-to-tempo/releases/tag/v0.0.6

- when logging to an issue that does not exist, provide suggestions (based on similar aliases and issue summaries)

- on `lt alias --unset` completion, only existing aliases are suggested
- fix keyring issues
  - keyring provided by `1password-cli` could not be used to persist token → default to system keyring on macOS

  - `month` → `last_30_days`
  - `week_to_date` → `week`
  - `month_to_date` → `month`
- support abbreviations for relative date ranges (e.g. `l7` for `last_7_days`)
- fix issue where app dir would not be created on first run
- fix issue with formatted durations, where days would not be accounted for
- fix issue where token was saved to third-party keyrings (e.g. 1Password)
- parse more relative dates (e.g. "3 weeks ago") (using [`dateparser.parse`][dateparser.parse])
