-----

Log your time to tempo on a self-hosted Jira instance from the convenience of your command line.

## Requirements

This tool is developed against

- Jira Server v9.4.17
- Tempo Timesheets 17.2.0 plugin

Any deviation from that setup might lead to issues.
Feel free to provide PRs to support other configurations.

## Installation

```console
pip install log-time-to-tempo
```

## Getting Started

To initialize authentication and local caches of projects and issues, run

```
lt init
```

If you want to enable shell completion (which makes picking issues much easier), run

```
lt --install-completion
```

## Usage

### Log Time

```sh
# log full workday to default issue
lt log
# log 2h to default issue
lt log 2h
# log 2h to specific issue
lt log 2h TSI-1
# log with custom message
lt log -m "working on foo" 2h TSI-1
# log multiple entries at once
lt logm MyProject:6,OPT:2
```

### Check Logged Time

```sh
# show logged time per issue
lt stats
# show logged time per issue for current month
lt stats month
# ..also show individual worklogs
lt stats -v
```

### Check Budget (i.e. logged and remaining time per person)

```sh
# show remaining time
lt budget TS-XXXXX
```

### Set Aliases

```sh
# set alias name for a commonly used issue
lt alias TSI-7 OPT
lt alias TS-10402 ProjectName
# unset aliases
lt alias --unset ProjectName
# show all aliases
lt alias
```

## Configuration

The `lt config` command allows to change the default behavior, either system wide (`--system`) or in the local directory and subdirectories.

Here are a couple of usage examples:

```sh
# Set custom jira instance for all projects (i.e. system-wide)
lt config --system JIRA_INSTANCE https://jira.my-server.com

# Set default issue for worklogs created from current directory (and subdirectories)
lt config LT_LOG_ISSUE TSI-7

# Start all your worklogs at 10am (instead of the default 9am)
lt config --system LT_LOG_START 10

# Remove all custom configuration
lt config --unset
```
