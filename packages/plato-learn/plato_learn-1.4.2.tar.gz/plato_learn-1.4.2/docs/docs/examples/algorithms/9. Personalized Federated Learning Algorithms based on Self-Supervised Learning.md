This category aims to achieve personalized federated learning by introducing self-supervised learning (SSL) to the training process. With SSL, an encoder model is trained to learn representations from unlabeled data. A higher performance can be achieved in subsequent tasks with the trained encoder. Only the encoder model is globally aggregated and shared during the regular training process. After reaching convergence, each client can download the trained global model to extract features from local samples.
