# Codesi: The Hinglish Programming Language

![Codesi Logo Placeholder](assets/codesi_logo.png)

## üöÄ Revolutionizing Programming with Simplicity and Innovation

Codesi is a groundbreaking programming language designed to make coding more intuitive, accessible, and powerful. Developed with a unique Hinglish (Hindi + English) syntax, Codesi breaks down language barriers, allowing developers from diverse linguistic backgrounds to write elegant and expressive code. Beyond its innovative syntax, Codesi integrates a suite of first-of-its-kind features that enhance developer productivity, understanding, and control.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Codesi isn't just another programming language; it's a paradigm shift. Here are some of its standout features:

*   **Hinglish Syntax**: Write code in a natural blend of Hindi and English, making programming more approachable and culturally relevant.
*   **Auto-Correction**: Intelligent syntax correction helps you write error-free code faster, reducing debugging time and frustration.
*   **Self-Explaining Code**: Codesi can explain its own logic and functionality without relying on external AI/ML models or APIs, fostering deeper understanding and easier collaboration.
*   **Time Machine**: Navigate through your code's history with unprecedented control. Go back and forth in time, review changes, and manage your project's evolution effortlessly.
*   **Smart History**: Beyond simple version control, Codesi's smart history provides contextual insights into your development timeline.
*   **Jaadu (Magic) Feature**: Receive personalized, context-aware suggestions and hints for common errors, making the learning curve smoother and problem-solving more efficient.
*   **Comprehensive Standard Library**: A rich set of built-in functions for type conversion, string manipulation, array operations, file I/O, and date/time management.
*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Full support for classes, objects, inheritance, and methods to build scalable and modular applications.
*   **Control Flow**: Intuitive constructs for conditional logic (agar, nahi_to, ya_phir) and looping (jabtak, karo, har).

## üí° Why Codesi?

Codesi is built on the philosophy that programming should be accessible to everyone. By combining a familiar linguistic style with cutting-edge features, Codesi empowers:

*   **Beginners**: A gentle introduction to programming concepts with a syntax that resonates.
*   **Experienced Developers**: Powerful tools for rapid development, advanced debugging, and code comprehension.
*   **Global Community**: Bridging the gap between diverse linguistic communities in the world of software development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with Codesi, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

2.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RishaankGupta/Codesi.git
    cd Codesi
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

For more detailed installation instructions, refer to [INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

### Quickstart: Hello Codesi!

Create a file named `hello.codesi`:

```codesi
likho("Hello, Codesi!")
```

Run your first Codesi program:

```bash
python -m codesi run hello.codesi
```

This will output:

```
Hello, Codesi!
```
