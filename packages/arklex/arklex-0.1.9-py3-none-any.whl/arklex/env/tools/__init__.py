"""Tool implementations for the Arklex framework.

This module contains various tool implementations that provide specific functionalities
for the Arklex framework. These tools include database utilities, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
Generation) components, search capabilities, and other utility functions.

Key Components:
- Base Tools (tools.py):
  - Abstract base class for all tools
  - Common functionality and interface definition
- Utility Tools (utils.py):
  - Common utility functions and helpers
- Integration Tools:
  - Shopify integration (shopify/)
  - HubSpot integration (hubspot/)
  - Google services (google/)
  - Acuity integration (acuity/)
- Database Tools:
  - Database operations (database/)
  - Booking database (booking_db/)
- RAG Tools:
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG/)
- Custom Tools:
  - User-defined tool implementations (custom_tools/)
- Sample Tools:
  - Example tool implementations (sample_tools.py)

Key Features:
- Modular tool architecture
- Integration with external services
- Database operation support
- RAG system integration
- Custom tool extensibility
- Utility function library

Usage:
    # Import specific tools as needed
    from arklex.env.tools import (
        BaseTool,
        DatabaseTool,
        RAGTool,
        SearchTool,
        CustomTool
    )

    # Initialize and use tools
    tool = DatabaseTool()
    result = tool.execute(params, **kwargs)
"""

# Note: Each tool implementation provides specialized functionality
# while adhering to the common interface defined in the base tool class.
