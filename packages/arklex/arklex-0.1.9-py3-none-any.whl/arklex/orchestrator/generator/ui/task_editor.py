class TaskEditorApp(App):
    """A Textual app to edit tasks and steps in a hierarchical structure.

    This class provides a text-based user interface for editing tasks and their steps.
    It supports adding, editing, and deleting tasks and steps in a tree structure.
    The interface uses keyboard shortcuts for navigation and editing operations.

    The app displays tasks as parent nodes and their steps as child nodes in a tree
    structure. Users can navigate using arrow keys, edit nodes by selecting them,
    add new nodes with 'a', delete nodes with 'd', and save changes with 's'.

    Attributes:
        tasks (list): List of task dictionaries containing task names and steps.
                     Each task dict should have a 'name' key and optionally a 'steps' key.
        task_tree (Tree | None): The tree widget displaying tasks and steps, initialized as None.
                                Set during the compose() method.
        _data_manager (TaskDataManager): Manager for task data operations
        _input_modal_class (type): Class for creating input modals (injectable for testing)

    Methods:
        compose(): Creates the main UI components and populates the tree
        on_mount(): Initializes the UI after mounting and sets focus
        on_tree_node_selected(): Handles node selection events and opens edit modal
        on_key(): Processes keyboard input for navigation and actions
        action_add_node(): Adds new nodes to the tree via modal input
        show_input_modal(): Displays the input modal dialog for editing
        update_tasks(): Updates the tasks list from the tree structure
        run(): Runs the app and returns the updated tasks list

    Keyboard Shortcuts:
        - Arrow keys: Navigate tree nodes
        - 'a': Add new node as child of selected node
        - 'd': Delete selected node (if not root)
        - 's': Save changes and exit
        - Enter: Edit selected node
