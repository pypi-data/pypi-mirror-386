"""
This module implements convenience functions for querying databases using the Python Database API Specification v2.0
(DB-API2). Documentation for DB-API2 is available from https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/.

    transaction start is the first statement executed, or the first statement executed since the most recent commit or
    rollback. Therefore, this context manager does not define a transaction start -- it could continue a transaction
    that was started previously.
