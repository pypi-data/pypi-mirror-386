"""
Implements the Web Service Transition Language (WeSTL) document format, which is specified at
http://rwcbook.github.io/wstl-spec/.

This format is used to drive the server-side representor pattern, described at
https://github.com/the-hypermedia-project/charter. The WeSTL format exists in two different 'states'. In
its design-time state, it contains the list of all possible state transitions for a Web service. In its runtime state,
it contains the list of the selected transitions for the current resource along with any data associated with that
resource. The design-time document can be used to define all possible transitions including possible arguments for
querying or writing data. The runtime document can be passed to a module in the heaserver.representor package that can
turn the WeSTL document into a representation format (HTML, Collection+JSON, HAL, etc.).

WeSTL documents have the following format:
{
  "wstl": {
    "actions": [...]
    "data": [...]
  }
}
The state transitions are listed in the "actions" property. Runtime WeSTL documents additionally have a "data" property
containing a list of data items. In HEA, the data items are name-value-pair JSON objects. Actions have the following
properties:
{
  "name": the unique name of the state transition. HEA uses the following naming convention:
  <package-name>-<lowercase-HEADesktopObject-class-name>-<verb-phrase-describing-the-state-transition>, for example,
  heaserver-registry-component-get-properties.
  "type": safe or unsafe, depending on whether the state transition will cause data to be written.
  "target": a space separated list of string values that tag the action for a representor to control how it is rendered.
  HEA defines the following target values that are combined to render actions differently:
    cj: for use in Collection+JSON documents. The action will not render in a Collection+JSON document without this tag
    or the cj-template tag (see below).
    item: applies to each item in the data list, for example, renders a separate link for each item.
    list: applies to the whole data list, for example, renders a single link for the entire list.
    cj-template: for rendering as a template in Collection+JSON documents. Use item or list to indicate whether the
      template should apply to the first item in the document or all items in the document (there can be only one
      template per document).
    read: together with item and cj, renders as a link for each item in a Collection+JSON document.
    href: together with item and cj, renders as bare href and rel properties for each item in a Collection+JSON document.
    add: for templates, will populate the default value of a form field with the corresponding WSTL action's value.
  "prompt": text to use in buttons or hyperlinks generated from the action.
  "href": included at runtime, the URL to go to if the link is followed.
  "rel": contains an array of link relation values, as defined in RFC5988 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5988).
  HEA reserves the "hea-" and "hea-data-" prefixes for relation values and defines the following standard set of
  relation values:
    hea-opener: a link to the content of an openable HEADesktopObject.
    hea-opener-choices: a link to choices for opening an openable HEADesktopObject.
    hea-context-aws: a link that applies to Amazon Web Services-related contexts.
    hea-default: a default value. It is used together with hea-opener to denote the default choice among opener choices.
    If a value beginning with hea-context- is present, there may be multiple links tagged with this value, one per
      context.
    hea-icon-duplicator: Instructs the client to use a duplicator icon when displaying the link on screen. The client
      is expected to map this rel value to an appropriate icon.
    hea-icon-mover: Instructs the client to use a mover icon when displaying the link on screen. The client is expected
      to map this rel value to an appropriate icon.
    hea-properties: a link to a form to edit the properties of the desktop object.
    hea-desktop-object: a link to a form to edit the properties of an associated desktop object.
    mime types: links to the content of an openable HEADesktopObject must include supported MIME types among their
      link relation values.
    hea-actual: a link to an Item's actual value.
    hea-volume: a link to the object's volume.
    hea-account: a link to the object's account, if there is one.
    hea-person: the person associated with this object, if different from the object's owner.
    hea-search: a link to enable account level search functionality.
    hea-context-menu-item: indicates that this link should be included as an item of the object's context menu.
    hea-trash: a link to the trash for this object's volume.
    hea-trash-original: the original link to the object in the trash.
    hea-trash-restore-confirmer: link to restore the item from the trash.
    hea-trash-delete-confirmer: link to delete a trash item permanently.
    hea-trash-emptier: link to delete everything in the trash permanently.
    hea-deleter: link to delete an item permanently.
    hea-dynamic-standard: instructs the client to generate a form using a Collection+JSON template retrieved from the
      backend with a GET call to the URL in the link. The client then POSTs or PUTs the completed form to the same URL,
      which saves the form contents on the backend. A POST call is expected to return a 201 status code if successful,
      with an empty response body and the URL of the created object in the response's Location header. A successful PUT
      call is expected to return a 204 status code with an empty response body. The decision to make a POST or PUT call
      is made by the client based on whether the template is being used to create a new desktop object or update an
      existing object.
    hea-dynamic-clipboard: same as hea-dynamic-standard, except the client must submit the completed form in a POST
      call to the URL from which it got the form template. The POST call must return a 200 status code if successful,
      and the body must contain a heaobject.data.ClipboardData object. The client is expected to copy the data property
      to the system clipboard, using the mime_type property as needed.
    hea-system-menu-item: denotes menu items for the client application's system menu. It is currently only used by the
      HEA Server People Microservice. What happens next depends on the link's rel values:
        hea-dynamic-standard: the application must follow the link and present the desktop object or object metadata in
          the response. The HTTP response to the link's URL is assumed to return a 200 status code if successful and
          contain zero or more desktop objects in a supported format such as Collection+JSON. For data objects, the
          client application may use the objects' mime types and/or a mime type listed in the link's relation values to
          control its behavior. Mime types listed in the link's relation values would typically be the expected mime
          types of the objects in the HTTP response.
        hea-dynamic-clipboard: the application must follow the link and request a response type that includes a form
          template such as Collection+JSON. The application must then present a form based on the template. Upon form
          submission, the application must place the response body on the system clipboard if the HTTP response has a
          200 status code.
    hea-user-menu-item: denotes menu items for the client application's user menu. It is currently only used by the HEA
      Server People Microservice. What happens next depends on the link's rel values:
        hea-dynamic-standard: the application must follow the link and present the desktop object or object metadata in
          the response. The HTTP response to the link's URL is assumed to return a 200 status code if successful and
          contain zero or more desktop objects in a supported format such as Collection+JSON. For data objects, the
          client application may use the objects' mime types and/or a mime type listed in the link's relation values to
          control its behavior. Mime types listed in the link's relation values would typically be the expected mime
          types of the objects in the HTTP response.
        hea-dynamic-clipboard: the application must follow the link and request a response type that includes a form
          template such as Collection+JSON. The application must then present a form based on the template. Upon form
          submission, the application must place the response body on the system clipboard if the HTTP response has a
          200 status code.
    hea-downloader: is an action other than the default opener for downloading file content. If paired with
        hea-opener-choices, it denotes that at least one of the opener choices supports downloading content.
    hea-uploader: action for uploading files into a container.
    hea-default-downloader: if there are multiple actions with the hea-downloader rel value, this must be the default
        selection.
    hea-recently-accessed: a link to recently accessed objects.
    hea-container: the opener link is to a URL that returns a collection of desktop objects.
    hea-self-container: paired with self to represent a desktop object that can be opened as a container.
    hea-actual-container: paired with hea-actual to represent an actual desktop object that can be opened as a
        container.
    hea-delete-preflight: a link to a preflight operation to execute prior to deleting a component resource's objects.
    hea-link-preflight: a link to a preflight operation to execute prior to following a link. The link is also expected
        to have rel values describing the action for which it is intended so as to allow searching for the correct
        preflight operation for an action.
    hea-component: a link to the registry component that is responsible for a desktop object.
    hea-auto-submission: for a template -- submits the form automatically with its default values.
    hea-message-warning: for a form template that comprises a warning message.
    hea-parent: link to an object that is the parent of the current object, if any.

  Relation values with the "headata-" prefix are to be used to denote link hrefs that should be used as template
  values. For eample, an action with relation values "headata-destination" will populate a template field with name
  "destination".
  Additionally, the "self" relation value is only applicable to a getter of one object and denotes a state transition
  to the same object as described in RFC 5988. The action's URL should be the object's canonical URL.
}

Actions may have a list of inputs, as described in the WeSTL specification, that can be used to generate form templates
for display in the client-side user interface. Completed forms are then sent from the client to the server in POST and
PUT requests, and they may be parsed by a representor module to create a dictionary of key-value pairs corresponding to
the completed form fields. In most cases, these key-value pairs correspond to the fields of a HEA desktop object, in
which case a HEA desktop object's from_dict() method can be used to ingest the form fields values. Representor modules
are required to parse form field values into a dictionary in which the key-value pairs appear in the same order as form
field values, and the HEA desktop object from_dict() method will read the key-value pairs and set the corresponding
fields in order of appearance. In situations where a desktop object has dependent fields (i.e., setting one field
updates another), you have three choices: 1) rely on the form field order to ensure that the corresponding HEA desktop
object fields are set in a sensible order (at the possible expense of form fields appearing out of sync in the client);
2) duplicate the dependencies' logic in your client-side form so that the form field order is irrelevant, which means
having to create a custom form rather than relying on the WeSTL inputs to generate the form dynamically; 3) for groups
of dependent form fields, include only one of them in the form. Generally, you will want to choose option 3.

This module provides a class and functions for creating WeSTL design-time and run-time documents in JSON format, and
validating those documents.

HEA follows the WeSTL spec with the following exceptions and extensions:
* Action names should use the following convention, all lowercase with dashes between words:
<project_slug>-<heaobject_classname>-<verb_describing_action>, for example, heaobject-registry-component-get-properties.
Failure to follow this convention could result in collisions between your action names and any action names added to
core HEA in the future.
* We extended the runtime document's inputs with a hea property, whose value must be an object with any of the
following properties:
    * href: the resource URL of the data, usually the request URL.
    * cardinality: "single" or "multiple" to indicate whether the form field supports a single value or multiple
      values.
    * type: additional form field types. The allowed values are:
      selected-object-url: the URL of an object as a string, pre-populated when the client renders the form, typically
          with the URL objects that triggered the HTTP request for the form. If cardinality is multiple, the the field
          must be a list of the selected object URLs. If the cardinality is single or unspecified, the field must
          display the first selected desktop object URL. An input of this type is currently read-only regardless of the
          value of the readOnly property, but for backward compatibility, set the readOnly property to true because a
          future extension of HEA may require non-read-only selected-object-url inputs to support adding and removing
          desktop object URLs from the list.
      object-url: the URL of a desktop object as a string. If cardinality is multiple, the the field must be a list of
          desktop object URLs. Unlike selected-object-url, this field is not pre-populated when the client renders the
          form. Instead, the client must provide facilities for populating the field with one or more desktop object
          URLs.
      datetime: an ISO date-time value.
    * section: combines related form fields to be rendered together on screen, such as in a HTML field set.
    * sectionPrompt: the display name of the section. It is required on the first form field of the section.
    * optionsFromUrl: gets a list of options from a HEA desktop object endpoint. This property's value is an object
    with the following properties:
      path: the path of the endpoint, not including the base URL of the API gateway.
      value: the property of the returned options to use as the id field of the select.
      text: the property of the returned options to use as the display name of the select.
    * display: true or false to make this form field visible or hidden.
    * object-url-target-types-include: a list of type strings that are permitted in the object-url form field. Goes
    together with "object-url" in the hea type field.

    pulled into the action. It also has rel values as described in IETF RFC
    5988 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5988), and an itemif
