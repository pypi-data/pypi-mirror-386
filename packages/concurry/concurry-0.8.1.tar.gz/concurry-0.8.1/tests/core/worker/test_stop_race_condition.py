"""
Tests for race condition between stop() and submission queue.

This test file specifically tests the race condition where:
1. A worker's submission queue is full
2. A thread is blocked waiting to acquire the submission semaphore
3. stop() is called while the thread is blocked
4. The blocked thread should NOT execute after stop() is called

This is a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.

        3. Waits briefly for tasks to start
        4. Starts a background thread to submit 3 more tasks (will block on full queues)
        5. Waits for submissions to block
        6. Calls stop() on the pool while submissions are blocked
        7. Verifies blocked submissions either failed with RuntimeError or futures error on result()
