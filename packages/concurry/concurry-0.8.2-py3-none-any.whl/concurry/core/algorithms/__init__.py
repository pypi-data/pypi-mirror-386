"""Algorithm implementations for concurry.

This module provides factory functions for creating algorithm instances:
- Poller: Create polling strategies for efficient future completion checking
- RateLimiter: Create rate limiters for resource protection
- LoadBalancer: Create load balancers for worker pool distribution

Implementation classes are private and should not be imported directly.
Always use the factory functions instead.
