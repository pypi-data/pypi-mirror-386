# Sentinel value to distinguish "no argument provided" from "None provided"
# This is useful when a function parameter can legitimately be None, but you need
# to know if the user explicitly passed None vs. didn't pass anything at all.

# Example usage:
#   def foo(x: Union[str, _NO_ARG_TYPE] = _NO_ARG):
#       if x is _NO_ARG:
#           # User didn't provide x

#           # User explicitly passed None
#       else:
#           # User passed some value
_NO_ARG = object()
# Use Any for the type since object() instances can't be typed more precisely
