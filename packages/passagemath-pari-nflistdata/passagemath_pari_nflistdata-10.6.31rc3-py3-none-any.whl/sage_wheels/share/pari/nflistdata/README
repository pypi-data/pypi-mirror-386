This is the nflistdata package for PARI/GP, to be used by the 'nflist' function

It contains
- tables of A5 number fields, from John JONES and David ROBERTS
  (https://hobbes.la.asu.edu/NFDB/). These are needed for groups 5T4 = A5
  and 6T4 = A5(6). Complete up to
    r2=0: disc <= 524286^2 ~ 2.7*10^11
    r2=2: disc <= 10^8

- tables of A5 number fields, from Bill ALLOMBERT and Aurel PAGE,
  ordered by minimal conductor of a 2-dimensional Artin representation with the
  corresponding icosahedral projective image. Complete up to conductor 10^6 for
  both signatures.

- tables of regular extensions of Q(t) for most transitive subgroups
  of S_n, n <= 15, by
  * Juergen KLUENERS and Gunter MALLE (see G. Malle and B. H. Matzat, Inverse
  Galois Theory, Springer, 1999).
  * Tim DOKCHITSER
  These are needed by nflist(G, 't) for groups of degree 8 or more
