This project follows a X.Y.Z version scheme according to the following:

- Add/remove register files, increment X
- register adds / remove, increment Y
- register edits and/or value edits increment Z


### Pre-commit

This project uses pre-commit hooks to make sure the code is following the style guide.
To install the pre-commit hooks, run the following command:

```
    pre-commit install
```

The hooks will run automatically when you commit changes to the repository.

The code MUST run the pre-commit hooks before commiting. If the hooks fail, the commit will be rejected.

### Tests
The tests are located under the `naluconfigs/tests/` directory, and use [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest).
To run the tests, run `naluconfigs/run_tests.bat`. This will run the tests and also generate a coverage report to
`naluconfigs/coverage.xml`.

Make sure to keep the test coverage at 100%. This is doable, since NaluConfigs is a relatively simple package.
The [Coverage Gutters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters)
extension is highly recommended to monitor test coverage.
