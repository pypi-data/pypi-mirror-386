"""
Data writers module for quantiq.

This module provides functionality for writing quantiq data structures
to various file formats. Writer implementations will be added in future
phases to support common data serialization formats.

Future implementations may include:
- CSV writers for tabular data
- HDF5 writers for large datasets
- JSON/YAML writers for metadata
- Binary formats for efficient storage

Examples
--------
Future usage example::

    from quantiq.dataio.writers import CSVWriter

    writer = CSVWriter()
    writer.write(dataset, 'output.csv')
