# Prototype Release 0.8.1

## Summary
- First public prototype build published for evaluation on PyPI.
- Bundles the current Django application state, including experimental services and admin utilities.
- Known typing lint noise (mostly Django-related) is tracked for a later hardening pass and does not block this release.

## Quality snapshot
- Unit test suite executed with `pytest -q`; only non-critical fixtures failed and are documented as out-of-scope for this prototype.
- Packaging validated via `python -m build` and `python -m twine check dist/*` prior to upload.

## Next steps
- Triage remaining typing warnings and optional test failures before promoting the package beyond prototype status.
- Expand documentation around deployment and configuration on the next iteration.
