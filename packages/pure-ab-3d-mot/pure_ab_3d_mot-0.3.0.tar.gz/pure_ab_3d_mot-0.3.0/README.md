# Pure AB3DMOT

The gist of the AB3DMOT (a base-line of 3D multiple-object tracking).

[Original repo](https://github.com/xinshuoweng/AB3DMOT)


The original package is refactored to demonstrate the (binary) classification of 
the tracks via instrumentation of the tracker.

See the [changelog](https://github.com/kovalp/pure-ab-3d-mot/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed list of refactoring edits.

## Usage

The package contains a bare minimum for the tracker to function.
The work on using the tracker in evaluation of the tracking will be done 
in a separate repository.

## Install

```shell

pip install pure-ab-3d-mot
```
