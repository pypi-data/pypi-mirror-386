           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# EZ MCP Toolbox

*A Comet ML Open Source Project*

This Python toolbox contains four command-line easy to use utilities:

1. `ez-mcp-server` - turns a file of Python functions into a MCP server
2. `ez-mcp-chatbot` - interactively debug MCP servers, with traces logged to [Opik](https://www.comet.com/site/products/opik/)
3. `ez-mcp-eval` - evaluate LLM applications using Opik's evaluation framework
4. `ez-mcp-optimize` - optimize LLM applications using Opik's optimization framework

## Why?

The `ez-mcp-server` allows a quick way to examine tools, signatures, descriptions, latency, and return values. Combined with the chatbot, you can create a fast workflow to interate on your MCP tools.

The `ez-mcp-chatbot` allows a quick method to examine and debug LLM and MCP tool interactions, with observability available through [Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik). Although the [Opik Playground](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/opik-university/prompt-engineering/prompt-playground) gives you the ability to test your prompts on datasets, do A/B testing, and more, this chatbot gives you a command-line interaction, debugging tools, combined with Opik observability.

The `ez-mcp-eval` and `ez-mcp-optimize` commands provide evaluation and optimization capabilities for your LLM applications, enabling you to measure performance and automatically improve your prompts using Opik's evaluation and optimization frameworks.

## Installation

```
pip install ez-mcp-toolbox --upgrade
```

## Quick start

### Interactive Chat with MCP Tools
```
ez-mcp-chatbot
```

That will start a `ez-mcp-server` (using example tools below) and the `ez-mcp-chatbot` configured to use those tools.

### Evaluate LLM Applications
```
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "my-dataset" --metric "Hallucination"
```

This will evaluate your LLM application using Opik's evaluation framework with your dataset and chosen metrics.

You can also limit the evaluation to the first N items of the dataset:

```bash
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "large-dataset" --metric "Hallucination" --num 100
```

### Customize the chatbot

You can customize the chatbot's behavior with a custom system prompt:

```bash
# Use a custom system prompt
ez-mcp-chatbot --prompt "You are a helpful coding assistant"

# Create a default configuration
ez-mcp-chatbot --init
```

Example dialog:

![ez-mcp-video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/296d7084-becd-467c-878c-16daec714b65)

This interaction of the LLM with the MCP tools will be logged, and available for examination and debugging in Opik:

<img width="800" alt="chatbot interaction as logged to opik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ad0d79a-7f99-4211-aede-5e0cd81d80c3" />

The rest of this file describes these three commands.

## ez-mcp-server

A command-line utility for turning a regular file of Python functions or classes into a full-fledged MCP server.

### Example

Take an existing Python file of functions, such as this file, `my_tools.py`:

```python
# my_tools.py
def add_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Add two numbers together.

    Args:
        a: First number to add
        b: Second number to add

    Returns:
        The sum of a and b
    """
    return a + b

def greet_user(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Greet a user with a welcoming message.

    Args:
        name: The name of the person to greet

    Returns:
        A personalized greeting message
    """
    return f"Welcome to ez-mcp-server, {name}!"
```

Then run the server with your custom tools:

```bash
ez-mcp-server my_tools.py
```

You can also load tools from installed Python modules:

```bash
ez-mcp-server opik_optimizer.utils.core
```

Or download tools from a URL:

```bash
ez-mcp-server https://example.com/my_tools.py
```

The server will automatically:
- Load all functions from your file or module (no ez_mcp_toolbox imports required)
- Convert them to MCP tools
- Generate JSON schemas from your function signatures
- Use your docstrings as tool descriptions

Note: if you just launch the server, it will wait for stdio input. This is designed
to run from inside a system that will dynamically start the server (see below).

### Command-line Options

```
ez-mcp-server [-h] [--transport {stdio,sse}] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--include INCLUDE] [--exclude EXCLUDE] [tools_file]
```

Positional arguments:
  * `tools_file` - Path to tools file, module name, URL to download from, or 'none' to disable tools (e.g., 'my_tools.py', 'opik_optimizer.utils.core', 'https://example.com/tools.py', or 'none') (default: DEMO)

Options:
  * `-h`, `--help` - show this help message and exit
  * `--transport {stdio,sse}` - Transport method to use (default: `stdio`)
  * `--host HOST` - Host for SSE transport (default: `localhost`)
  * `--port PORT` - Port for SSE transport (default: `8000`)
  * `--include INCLUDE` - Python regex pattern to include only matching tool names
  * `--exclude EXCLUDE` - Python regex pattern to exclude matching tool names

### Tool Filtering

You can control which tools are loaded using the `--include` and `--exclude` flags with Python regex patterns:

```bash
# Include only tools with "add" or "multiply" in the name
ez-mcp-server my_tools.py --include "add|multiply"

# Exclude tools with "greet" or "time" in the name
ez-mcp-server my_tools.py --exclude "greet|time"

# Use both filters together
ez-mcp-server my_tools.py --include ".*number.*" --exclude ".*square.*"

# Use with default tools
ez-mcp-server --include "add" --exclude "greet"
```

**Filtering Logic:**
- The `--include` filter is applied first, keeping only tools whose names match the regex pattern
- The `--exclude` filter is then applied, removing any tools whose names match the regex pattern
- Both filters can be used together for fine-grained control
- Invalid regex patterns will cause the server to exit with an error message

# Ez MCP Chatbot

A powerful AI chatbot that integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and provides observability through Opik tracing. This chatbot can connect to various MCP servers to access specialized tools and capabilities, making it a versatile assistant for different tasks.

## Features

- **MCP Integration**: Connect to multiple Model Context Protocol servers for specialized tool access
- **Opik Observability**: Built-in tracing and observability with Opik integration
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Rich console interface with command history and auto-completion
- **Python Code Execution**: Execute Python code directly in the chat environment
- **Tool Management**: Discover and use tools from connected MCP servers
- **Configurable**: JSON-based configuration for models and MCP servers
- **Async Support**: Full asynchronous operation for better performance

### MCP Integration

The server implements the full MCP specification:

- **Tool Discovery**: Dynamic tool listing and metadata
- **Tool Execution**: Asynchronous tool calling with proper error handling
- **Protocol Compliance**: Full compatibility with MCP clients
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new tools and capabilities

## Example

Create a default configuration file:

```bash
ez-mcp-chatbot --init
```

This creates a `ez-config.json` file with default settings.

Edit `ez-config.json` to specify your model and MCP servers. For example:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
  "model_kwargs": {
    "temperature": 0.2
  },
  "mcp_servers": [
    {
      "name": "ez-mcp-server",
      "description": "Ez MCP server from Python files",
      "command": "ez-mcp-server",
      "args": ["/path/to/my_tools.py"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported model formats:

- `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- `anthropic/claude-3-sonnet`
- `google/gemini-pro`
- And many more through LiteLLM

### Basic Commands

Inside the `ez-mcp-chatbot`, you can have a normal LLM conversation.

In addition, you have access to the following meta-commands:

- `/clear` - Clear the conversation history
- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/debug on` or `/debug off` to toggle debug output
- `/show tools` - to list all available tools
- `/show tools SERVER` - to list tools for a specific server
- `/run SERVER.TOOL` - to execute a tool
- `! python_code` - to execute Python code (e.g., '! print(2+2)')
- `quit` or `exit` - Exit the chatbot


### Python Code Execution

Execute Python code by prefixing with `!`:

```
! print(self.messages)
! import math
! math.sqrt(16)
```

### Tool Usage

The chatbot automatically discovers and uses tools from connected MCP servers. Simply ask questions that require tool usage, and the chatbot will automatically call the appropriate tools.

## System Prompts

The chatbot uses a system prompt to define its behavior and personality. You can customize this using the `--prompt` command line option, which supports:
- Direct strings: `--prompt "You are a helpful assistant"`
- File paths: `--prompt ./my_prompt.txt`
- Opik prompt names: `--prompt my_optimized_prompt`

### Default System Prompt

By default, the chatbot uses this system prompt:

```
You are a helpful AI system for answering questions that can be answered
with any of the available tools.
```

### Custom System Prompts

You can override the default system prompt to customize the chatbot's behavior:

```bash
# Direct string prompts
ez-mcp-chatbot --prompt "You are an expert Python developer who helps with coding tasks."
ez-mcp-chatbot --prompt "You are a data scientist who specializes in analyzing datasets and creating visualizations."
ez-mcp-chatbot --prompt "You are a friendly AI assistant who loves to help users with their questions and tasks."

# Load prompt from file
ez-mcp-chatbot --prompt ./my_custom_prompt.txt

# Load prompt from Opik (if you have optimized prompts stored there)
ez-mcp-chatbot --prompt my_optimized_coding_assistant
```

The system prompt affects how the chatbot:
- Interprets user requests
- Decides which tools to use
- Structures its responses
- Maintains conversation context

## Opik Integration

The chatbot includes built-in Opik observability integration:

### Opik Modes

For the command-line flag `--opik`:

- `hosted` (default): Use hosted Opik service

### Dataset Loading

The `ez-mcp-eval` command supports loading datasets from two sources:

1. **Opik datasets**: If the dataset exists in your Opik account, it will be loaded directly
2. **opik_optimizer.datasets**: If the dataset is not found in Opik, the tool will automatically check for a function with the same name in `opik_optimizer.datasets` and create the dataset using that function

This allows you to use both pre-existing Opik datasets and dynamically generated datasets from the `opik_optimizer` package.

### Examples

#### Basic Evaluation
```bash
# Simple evaluation with Hallucination metric
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "qa-dataset" --metric "Hallucination"
```

#### Multiple Metrics
```bash
# Evaluate with multiple metrics
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Summarize this text" --dataset "summarization-dataset" --metric "Hallucination,LevenshteinRatio"
```

#### Custom Experiment Name
```bash
# Use a custom experiment name
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Translate to French" --dataset "translation-dataset" --metric "LevenshteinRatio" --experiment-name "french-translation-test"
```

#### Custom Model and Parameters
```bash
# Use a different model with custom parameters
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "qa-dataset" --metric "LevenshteinRatio" --model "gpt-4" --model-kwargs '{"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000}'
```

#### Using opik_optimizer Datasets
```bash
# Use a dataset from opik_optimizer.datasets (automatically created if not in Opik)
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "my_optimizer_dataset" --metric "Hallucination"
```

#### Custom Field Mappings
```bash
# Custom input and output field mappings
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "qa-dataset" --metric "LevenshteinRatio" --input "question" --output "reference=answer"
```

### Field Validation

The `ez-mcp-eval` command now includes automatic validation of input and output field mappings to prevent common configuration errors:

#### Input Field Validation
- **What it checks**: The `--input` field must exist in the dataset items
- **When it runs**: Before starting the evaluation
- **Error handling**: If the field doesn't exist, the command stops with a clear error message showing available fields

#### Output Field Validation
- **What it checks**:
  - The `--output` VALUE (dataset field) must exist in the dataset items
  - The `--output` KEY (metric parameter) must be a valid parameter for the selected metric(s) score method
- **When it runs**: Before starting the evaluation
- **Error handling**: If validation fails, the command stops with clear error messages

#### Example Validation Errors

```bash
# Input field not found in dataset
❌ Input field 'question' not found in dataset items
   Available fields: input, answer

# Output field not found in dataset
❌ Reference field 'response' not found in dataset items
   Available fields: input, answer

# Invalid metric parameter
❌ Output reference 'reference' is not a valid parameter for metric 'LevenshteinRatio' score method
   Available parameters: output, reference
```

This validation helps catch configuration errors early, saving time and preventing failed evaluations.

#### Using Custom Metrics from File
```bash
# Use custom metrics defined in a Python file
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "qa-dataset" --metric "CustomMetric" --metrics-file "my_metrics.py"
```

#### Using Custom Tools File
```bash
# Use a custom tools file for MCP server configuration
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "qa-dataset" --metric "LevenshteinRatio" --tools-file "my_tools.py"

# Use tools file from URL
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "qa-dataset" --metric "LevenshteinRatio" --tools-file "https://example.com/my_tools.py"
```

#### List Available Metrics
```bash
# See all available metrics
ez-mcp-eval --list-metrics
```

#### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug output for troubleshooting
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "qa-dataset" --metric "Hallucination" --debug
```

### Custom Metrics

You can define custom metrics in a Python file and use them with the `--metrics-file` option. The metric file should contain metric classes that follow the same interface as Opik's built-in metrics.

#### Example Custom Metric File (`my_metrics.py`)

```python
class CustomMetric:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "CustomMetric"

    def __call__(self, output, reference):
        # Your custom evaluation logic here
        # Return a score between 0 and 1
        return 0.8  # Example score
```

Then use it with:
```bash
ez-mcp-eval --prompt "Answer the question" --dataset "qa-dataset" --metric "CustomMetric" --metrics-file "my_metrics.py"
```
