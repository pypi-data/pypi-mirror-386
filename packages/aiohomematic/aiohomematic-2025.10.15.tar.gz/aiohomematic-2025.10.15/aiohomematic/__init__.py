"""
AioHomematic: a Python 3 library to interact with Homematic and HomematicIP backends.

Public API at the top-level package is defined by __all__.

This package provides a high-level API to discover devices and channels, read and write
parameters (data points), receive events, and manage programs and system variables.

Key layers and responsibilities:
- aiohomematic.central: Orchestrates clients, store, device creation and events.
- aiohomematic.client: Interface-specific clients (JSON-RPC/XML-RPC, Homegear) handling IO.
- aiohomematic.model: Data point abstraction for generic, hub, and calculated entities.
- aiohomematic.store: Persistent and runtime store for descriptions, values, and metadata.

Typical usage is to construct a CentralConfig, create a CentralUnit and start it, then
consume data points and events or issue write commands via the exposed API.
