Models and custom classes to work across the Chattyverse.

Lastest update: 2024-11-07

## Development instrucions

1. Install poetry https://python-poetry.org/docs/
2. Run `poetry install`
3. Install with pymongo: poetry install -E db to include pymongo dependencies

## Architecture

### Models

- Data containers with Pydantic validation
- No business logic
- Little to no functionality (for that, see Services)
- Used for:
  - Request/response validation
  - Database document mapping
  - Cross-service data transfer
- Example:
  - `Message` model

### Services

- Contain all business logic
- Work with models
- Stateless
- Handle:
  - Object creation (factories)
  - Model specific functionality
- Example:
  - `MessageFactory`
    - Create a `Message` from webhook data
    - Create a `Message` from an agent request to send it to a chat
    - Instantiate a `Message` from data base information
    - Create a `Message` from a Chatty Response

## Implementation Status

âœ… Implemented

### Models

- Base message models
  - DBMessage: Database message model
  - MessageRequest: It models the intent of a message to be sent to a chat, still not instantiated as ChattyMessage.
  - BaseMessage (abstract)
    - Subtypes: AudioMessage, DocumentMessage, ImageMessage, TextMessage, VideoMessage, etc.
- MetaNotificationJson: Models any notification from WhatsApp to the webhook
  - MetaMessageJson: Models the speicifc Notification with a messages object
  - MetaStatusJson: Models the specific Notification with a statuses object
  - MetaErrorJson: Models the specific Notification with an errors object
- ChattyResponse: Models a list of pre-set responses in Chatty, that will be instantiated as a ChattyMessage when sent to a chat.
- Auth0 company registrarion form model
- Event models
- Metrics models

### Services

- `MessageFactory`
  - Create a `Message` from webhook data
  - Create a `Message` from an agent request to send it to a chat
  - Instantiate a `Message` from data base information
  - Create a `Message` from a Chatty Response

ðŸš§ In Progress

- Chat and its modules and services
- Service layer completion
- Company Assets
