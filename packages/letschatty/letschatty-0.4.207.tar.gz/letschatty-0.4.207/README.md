Models and custom classes to work across the Chattyverse.

Lastest update: 2024-11-07

## Development instrucions

1. Install poetry https://python-poetry.org/docs/
2. Run `poetry install`
3. Install with pymongo: poetry install -E db to include pymongo dependencies

## Architecture

### Models

- Data containers with Pydantic validation
- No business logic
- Little to no functionality (for that, see Services)
- Used for:
  - Request/response validation
  - Database document mapping
  - Cross-service data transfer
- Example:
  - `Message` model

### Services

- Contain all business logic
- Work with models
- Stateless
- Handle:
  - Object creation (factories)
  - Model specific functionality
- Example:
  - `MessageFactory`
    - Create a `Message` from webhook data
    - Create a `Message` from an agent request to send it to a chat
    - Instantiate a `Message` from data base information
    - Create a `Message` from a Chatty Response

## Implementation Status
