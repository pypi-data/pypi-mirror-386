python-pagerduty: Clients for PagerDuty's APIs
==============================================
A module that supplies lightweight Python clients for the PagerDuty REST API v2 and Events API v2.

For in-depth usage documentation, refer to the `User Guide
<https://pagerduty.github.io/python-pagerduty/user_guide.html>`_.

Installation
------------
This library is available on the Python Package Index as `pagerduty <https://pypi.org/project/pagerduty/>`_, e.g.: 

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pagerduty

Command Line Interface
----------------------
This package also includes a basic CLI for PagerDuty Events API V2. For
example, to trigger an incident:

.. code-block:: bash

    pagerduty trigger -k $ROUTING_KEY --description "Network latency is high"

For more details, use the ``-h`` flag to display the script's helptext.

Overview
--------
This library supplies classes extending `requests.Session`_ from the Requests_
HTTP library that serve as Python interfaces to the `REST API v2`_ and `Events
API v2`_ of PagerDuty. One might call it an opinionated wrapper library. It is
the successor to the popular `pdpyras`_ library and is based on the same source
code.

The client was designed with the philosophy that `Requests`_ is a perfectly
adequate HTTP client, and that abstraction should focus only on the most
generally applicable and frequently-implemented core features, requirements and
patterns of APIs. Design decisions concerning how any particular PagerDuty
resource is accessed or manipulated through APIs are left to the user or
implementer to make.

Features
--------
- Uses Requests' automatic HTTP connection pooling and persistence
- Tested in / support for Python 3.6 through 3.13
- Abstraction layer for authentication, pagination, filtering and wrapped
  entities
- Configurable cooldown/reattempt logic for handling rate limiting and
  transient HTTP or network issues

History
-------
This project was borne of necessity for a basic API client to eliminate code
duplication in the PagerDuty Customer Support team's internal Python-based
tooling.

We found ourselves frequently performing REST API requests using beta or
non-documented API endpoints for one reason or another, so we needed the client
that provided easy access to features of the underlying HTTP library (i.e. to
obtain the response headers, or set special request headers). We also needed
something that eliminated tedious tasks like querying objects by name,
pagination and authentication. Finally, we discovered that the way we were
using `Requests`_ wasn't making use of its connection pooling feature, and
wanted a way to easily enforce this as a standard practice.

We evaluated at the time a few other open-source API libraries and deemed them
to be either overkill for our purposes or not giving the implementer enough
control over how API calls were made.
