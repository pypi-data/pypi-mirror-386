# qdiv

qdiv is a python package for analyzing results from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (or similar data).

With qdiv you can subset and rarefy the data, generate a consensus table based on several count tables, 
calculate alpha- and beta diversity indices (focusing on Hill-based indices), 
plot a heatmap or PCoA, carry out null model analysis (Raup-Crick, NRI, NTI, beta NRI, and beta NTI, extended to all possible diversity orders), 
and run the Mantel- and Permanova tests.

The documentation is available at https://qdiv.readthedocs.io
