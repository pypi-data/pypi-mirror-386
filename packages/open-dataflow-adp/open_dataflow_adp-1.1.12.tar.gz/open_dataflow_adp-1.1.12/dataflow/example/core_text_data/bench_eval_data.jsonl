{"question":"What is $10.0000198\\cdot 5.9999985401\\cdot 6.9999852$ to the nearest whole number?","solution":"Notice that $10.00001988$ is very close to $10$, $5.9999985401$ is very close to $6$ and $6.9999852$ is very close to $7$. Because the given numbers are all so close to integers, we're unlikely to go wrong by rounding before multiplying. We get $$10\\cdot6\\cdot7=\\boxed{420}.$$If we multiplied the given numbers with a calculator we would get $$6.9999852\\cdot5.9999985401\\cdot10.00001988=419.999844...$$which would still round to $420$.","answer":"420"}
{"question":"Two fair 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability the sum rolled is 9?","solution":"There are 4 different ways to roll a 9 (3+6, 4+5, 5+4, 6+3), which makes the probability of rolling a 9 equal to $\\dfrac{4}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{9}}$.","answer":"\\dfrac{1}{9}"}
{"question":"For what value of $x$ is the following equation true: $6500 + x - 4500 = 3400 + 2000$?","solution":"Simplifying both sides gives $x +2000 = 5400$.  Subtracting 2000 from both sides gives $x = \\boxed{3400}$.","answer":"3400"}
{"question":"At 2:30 p.m. during a long drive, Bobbi asks her parents, ``Are we there yet?'' Her mother responds, ``We will be there in 7200 seconds.''

{"question":"Compute $ \\frac{1}{31} \\div \\frac{1}{93} $.","solution":"Recall that division is multiplication by a reciprocal. So we rewrite the division by $\\frac{1}{93}$ as multiplication by the reciprocal of $\\frac{1}{93}$. Since the reciprocal of $\\frac{1}{93}$ is 93, we get  \\[\n\\frac{1}{31} \\div \\frac{1}{93} = \\frac{1}{31} \\cdot 93.\n\\]Now we can use the commutative property of multiplication to turn this into a division problem:  \\[\n\\frac{1}{31} \\cdot 93 = 93 \\cdot \\frac{1}{31} = 93 \\div 31 = \\boxed{3}.\n\\]","answer":"3"}

{"question":"Robin bought a four-scoop ice cream cone having a scoop each of vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cherry. In how many orders can the four scoops be stacked on the cone if they are stacked one on top of the other and chocolate cannot be on the bottom?","solution":"There are 3 choices for the bottom scoop. Then there are only 3 choices for the scoop above that (since one flavor has already been used), then 2 choices for the next scoop, and 1 choice for the final scoop.  This gives a total of $3\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{18}$ possible cones.","answer":"18"}
{"question":"What is the positive difference between the greatest and the least member of the set $\\left\\{\\frac{3}{7},\\frac{4}{3},\\frac{11}{8},\\frac{6}{16}\\right\\}$? Express your answer in simplest form.","solution":"The least member of the set is either $\\frac{3}{7}$ or $\\frac{6}{16}$, since these two members are the only ones smaller than 1. Since $\\frac{3}{7}=\\frac{6}{14}$, $\\frac{6}{16}$ is the smaller of the two. The greatest member is either $\\frac{4}{3}$ or $\\frac{11}{8}$. Since $\\frac{4}{3}=\\frac{32}{24}$ and $\\frac{11}{8}=\\frac{33}{24}$, $\\frac{11}{8}$ is the larger of the two. Thus, the desired difference is $\\frac{11}{8}-\\frac{6}{16}=\\frac{22}{16}-\\frac{6}{16}=\\boxed{1}$.","answer":"1"}
{"question":"If a certain negative number is multiplied by six, the result is the  same as 20 less than the original number.  What is the value of the  original number?","solution":"Let the number be $x$. We know that $6x=x-20$. Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives $5x=-20$.

{"question":"How many interior diagonals does a regular nine-sided polygon have?  (An $\\emph{interior diagonal }$ is a segment connecting two vertices which do not have an edge between them.)","solution":"There are 9 vertices in the polygon, so from each vertex there are potentially 8 other vertices to which we could extend a diagonal.  However, 2 of these 8 points are connected to the original point by an edge, so they are not connected by interior diagonals.  So each vertex is connected to 6 other points by interior diagonals.  This gives a preliminary count of $9 \\times 6 = 54$ interior diagonals.  However, we have counted each diagonal twice (once for each of its endpoints), so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting, and the answer is $\\dfrac{9\\times 6}{2} = \\boxed{27}$ diagonals.","answer":"27"}
{"question":"Mary and Jenna are playing a game in which each girl rolls a twenty-sided die with numbers from 1 to 20 on the faces.  If the number on the die that Mary rolls is a factor of the number on the die that Jenna rolls, Mary wins.  If the number on the die that Jenna rolls is a factor of the number on the die that Mary rolls, Jenna wins.  For how many possible rolls would both girls win?","solution":"We are trying to determine how many possible combinations of two numbers between 1 and 20 would make it so that the first number is a factor of the second number and the second number is a factor of the first number.  We know that all of the positive factors of a positive number, except for the number itself, are less than the number.  Therefore, if Jenna's number is greater than Mary's number, Jenna's number cannot be a divisor of Mary's number, and Jenna cannot win.\n\nLikewise, if Jenna's number is less than Mary's number, Mary's number must be greater than Jenna's number, Mary's number cannot be a divisor of Jenna's number, and Mary cannot win.  If Jenna's number is equal to Mary's number, both girls' numbers are factors of the other's number because any number is a factor of itself.  Thus, we can determine that for both girls to win, they must roll the same number.  Since there are 20 numbers on the dice, this means that there are $\\boxed{20}$ rolls for which both girls would win.","answer":"20"}
{"question":"What number must be placed in the box in the equation below to produce an equation that has more than one solution: \\[4x + 6 + 7x - 9 = 12x - 7 - x + \\boxed{\\phantom{2}}?\\]","solution":"Simplifying both sides gives \\[11x - 3 = 11x - 7 + \\boxed{\\phantom{2}}.\\] Subtracting $11x$ from both sides gives \\[-3 = -7 + \\boxed{\\phantom{2}}.\\] If the number in the box is anything but 4, then the equation cannot be true, and the original equation has no solutions.  If the number in the box is $\\boxed{4}$, then the two sides of the original equation are equivalent, and all values of $x$ are solutions to the equation.","answer":"4"}

{"question":"Two numbers are said to be 'relatively prime' if their greatest common factor is 1. How many integers greater than 10 and less than 30 are relatively prime with 28?","solution":"Since $28=2^2\\cdot 7$, a positive integer is relatively prime with $28$ if and only if it contains neither $2$ nor $7$ in its prime factorization.
