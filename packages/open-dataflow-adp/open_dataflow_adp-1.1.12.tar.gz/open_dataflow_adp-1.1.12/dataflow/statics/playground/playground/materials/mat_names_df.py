prompt = """You are an expert in materials science. You need analyze the composition and synthesis/process of the materials and extract the material names from the text.
    Follow these rules strictly:
    1. For composition and synthesis process analysis:
        - Describe all materials and their contents, synthesis process, etc. you find in the text, like:
         Base materials: Material1, Material2, Material3
         Modifiers identified: Additive with contents of 1 mass%, 3 mass%, and 5 mass%
         Additional components: Curing agent, etc.
         Synthesis: The materials were synthesized by mixing the base materials and modifiers.
         Process: The materials were annealed at 1000Â°C for 1 hour.

    2. For material names:
        -  List all materials that were actually tested, following these rules strictly, only use to distinguish different materials:
         - Include only materials with measured properties, this rule has priority over the other rules.
         - Use the abbreviations of sample provided by the author if possible, such as P1, P2, P3, etc.
         - If no name is provided, generate a unique name based on the composition and synthesis process. The process is not required, and only needed when different materials with different processes are tested.
         - The name should be as concise as possible, and should not be too long.
         - If the text is not related to materials, return empty string.

    3. For material types:
        - List the material type corresponding to each material listed above in material names.
        - Use "linear" or "cross_linked" to indicate the structure of polymers, instead of "polymer".
        - If the polymer structure ("linear" or "cross_linked") is not specified, default to "cross_linked".
        - Ensure the number of material types matches the number of material names.
    Do not include explanations, markdown formatting, or code fences (```).
