{"raw_content": "In recent years, the field of natural language processing has witnessed significant progress driven by the advent of large language models. These models, trained on massive corpora, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, including text generation, summarization, and question answering. However, despite their success, concerns remain about their data efficiency, generalization to low-resource languages, and robustness under distributional shifts."}
{"raw_content": "This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of domain-adaptive pretraining techniques for transformer-based models. By integrating task-relevant corpora into the pretraining stage, we observe consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted data selection and emphasize that not all additional data contributes equally to downstream performance."}
{"raw_content": "We propose an efficient multi-stage training pipeline that combines synthetic data generation, automatic filtering, and human-in-the-loop refinement. The system is designed to minimize annotation costs while maintaining high quality and diversity in the resulting dataset. Experiments show that our approach achieves comparable performance to fully human-labeled datasets in both classification and generation tasks."}
{"raw_content": "The rise of multimodal AI systems has enabled models to process and reason over diverse input formats such as text, images, and audio. In this work, we introduce a unified data framework that standardizes input preprocessing, alignment, and batching for multimodal tasks, significantly simplifying the training and evaluation of vision-language models."}
{"raw_content": "To address the limitations of one-pass data usage in current large model training paradigms, we explore strategies for selective data reuse. By identifying high-value samples through gradient-based scoring, we propose a curriculum that dynamically reintroduces informative examples during training. This method improves convergence speed and yields better generalization on challenging benchmarks."}
{"raw_content": "We conduct a rigorous analysis of prompt-based learning in cross-lingual settings. Our results show that prompt templates optimized for English often fail to transfer to other languages due to differences in syntax and pragmatics. We thus introduce a language-sensitive prompt optimization framework that outperforms traditional zero-shot transfer methods by a wide margin."}
{"raw_content": "Our research investigates the scaling behavior of multimodal large language models when jointly increasing visual encoder depth and language model capacity. Through extensive experiments across datasets like VQAv2, TextVQA, and ScienceQA, we reveal trade-offs between modality balance and cross-attention saturation, offering practical guidelines for future model design."}
{"raw_content": "This paper introduces a reference-free evaluation metric for long-form summarization tasks. Unlike traditional ROUGE or BLEU scores, our method leverages semantic similarity via pretrained sentence encoders and evaluates coherence, coverage, and conciseness. Human evaluations show a stronger correlation with our metric compared to existing automatic methods."}
{"raw_content": "We explore the use of reinforcement learning to fine-tune dialogue models for empathy. Using a composite reward function based on emotional alignment, relevance, and fluency, our system learns to generate more supportive and human-like responses. The results from both automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate substantial gains in perceived empathy and helpfulness."}
{"raw_content": "Our work presents a novel video question answering benchmark with temporally grounded annotations. We design a new dataset with fine-grained reasoning chains and dense frame references to test model understanding of temporal dependencies. Baseline models struggle with multi-hop temporal reasoning, highlighting the need for more temporally aware architectures."}
