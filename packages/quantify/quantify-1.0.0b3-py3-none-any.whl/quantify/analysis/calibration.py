    r"""
    Determine if dataset with S21 data has calibration points for 0 and 1 states.

    Three pieces of information are used to infer the presence of calibration points:

    - The angle of the calibration points with respect to the average of the datapoints,
    - The distance between the calibration points, and
    - The average distance to the line defined be the calibration points.

    The detection is made robust by averaging 3 datapoints for each extremity of
    the "segment" described by the data on the IQ-plane.

    .. seealso:: :ref:`howto-analysis-has-calibration-points`

    Parameters
    ----------
    s21
        Array of complex datapoints corresponding to the experiment on the IQ plane.
    indices_state_0
        Indices in the ``s21`` array that correspond to the ground state.
    indices_state_1
        Indices in the ``s21`` array that correspond to the first excited state.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        The inferred presence of calibration points.
