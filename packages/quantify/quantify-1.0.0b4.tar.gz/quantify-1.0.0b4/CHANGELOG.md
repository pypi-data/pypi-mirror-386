## Release v1.0.0b3 (2025-10-21)

### 🚀 Features

#### Instrument Monitor - Live QCoDeS Instruments/Parameters Tracking

Introduced **Instrument Monitor**, a lightweight Bokeh-based dashboard for live monitoring of QCoDeS instruments and parameters:

- **Automatic Discovery:** Discovers QCoDeS instruments from Station.default, instrument subclasses, or garbage collection fallback
- **Low-Latency Streaming:** Short snapshot warmup (5 passes) followed by efficient streaming via QCoDeS global parameter callbacks
- **Responsive UI:** Gated updates during user interactions (typing/scrolling) to maintain smooth performance
- **Dual View Modes:**
  - **Current State Table:** Filterable, sortable table of all parameter values with real-time updates
  - **Hierarchy Explorer:** Tree view showing instrument structure and nested submodules
- **Resource Monitoring:** Built-in panel tracking CPU, memory, and thread usage
- **Thread-Safe Architecture:** Immutable Pydantic models (`Reading`, `ChangeEvent`) for safe concurrent access
- **Extensibility Hooks:** Support for external streaming consumers via `InstrumentMonitorStreamHandle`
- **Non-Blocking API:** Background server with `MonitorHandle` for start/stop/wait control

**Technical Implementation:**

- Separation of concerns: discovery, state management, polling, and UI are fully decoupled
- `StateStore` with change detection and bounded ring buffer for recent events
- Batch-drained event queue to prevent unbounded memory growth
- Hash-based Bokeh ColumnDataSource updates to minimize DOM churn
- Configurable ingestion parameters (warmup passes, intervals, batch limits)

#### Plotmon - Real-Time Experiment Visualization

Introduced **Plotmon**, a comprehensive live data visualization tool for quantum experiments. Plotmon enables real-time monitoring of experimental results directly in the browser with the following capabilities:

- **Live Monitoring:** Instant visualization of experiment progress and results as data is collected
- **Multi-Experiment Management:** Quick switching between ongoing and completed experiments via an interactive data table
- **Flexible Plot Types:** Support for 1D line plots, 2D heatmaps, and multi-line overlays
- **Customizable Layouts:** Row-based graph arrangement with shared axis ranges for easy comparison
- **ZeroMQ Integration:** Standalone server mode for remote monitoring and integration with multiple data providers
- **Measurement Control Integration:** Seamless launch via `MeasurementControl(plotmon=True)` for instant setup
- **Modern UI:** Bokeh-based dashboard with responsive design, styled cards, and smooth animations
- **Session Management:** Per-session data isolation ensuring clean multi-user support
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Full user guides covering setup, configuration, and communication protocols

**Technical Implementation:**

- Server wrapper with Bokeh handler for web-based rendering
- Event-driven architecture with command processing (START, STOP, UPDATE_DATA, GRAPH_CONFIG)
- In-memory caching with configurable data retention
- Pydantic models for type-safe message validation
- Graph builder with figure factory pattern for extensible plot types

#### Measurement Control Enhancements

- **Update Functionality:** Added real-time update capabilities for measurement client and measurement control
- **Plot Configuration:** Automatic plot configuration creation from measurement control for seamless Plotmon integration
- **Client Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation for measurement client API and usage patterns

### 🐛 Bug Fixes and Closed Issues

- **Type Checking:** Fixed Pyright and linter issues across the codebase for improved type safety
- **QCoDeS Compatibility:** Fixed QCoDeS version compatibility issues in CI pipeline
- **Lazy Loading:** Added lazy loading for visualization modules to reduce import overhead and avoid circular dependencies

### 🔧 Other

- **Documentation:** Added comprehensive documentation for measurement client and Plotmon, including getting started guides, API references, and technical architecture details
- **Scheduler Integration:** Synced and merged documentation from `quantify-scheduler` for consistent user experience
- **Testing:** Added unit tests for Plotmon components and instrument monitor modules
- **UI Polish:** Enhanced Plotmon styling with modern card-based layouts, shadows, and responsive design

## Release v0.0.6 (2025-09-22)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes and Closed Issues
