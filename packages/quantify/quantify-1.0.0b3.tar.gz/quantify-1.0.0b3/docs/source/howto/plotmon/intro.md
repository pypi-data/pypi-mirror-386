# What is Plotmon?

**Plotmon** (Plotting Monitor) is a live data visualization tool designed for experiments. It enables users to monitor and explore experimental results in real time, directly in their web browser.

Plotmon was implemented for the following usecases:
- **Live monitoring:** Instantly see experiment progress and results as data is collected.
- **Experiment overview:** Quickly switch between ongoing and past experiments.
- **Customizable visualization:** Choose from a variety of plot types and layouts to best represent your data.
- **Seamless integration:** Works with any data provider that can send simple JSON packets, making it easy to add live plotting to new or existing experiments.

For more details on how Plotmon communicates with experiments, see the [commands](communication.md) section. To learn about available plot types and layouts, see [graphs](graphs) and [layout](layouts).
