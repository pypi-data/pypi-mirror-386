Based on this API analysis, create domain-specific user flows for Locust testing:
{{domain_analysis}}

API Analysis: Use the analyze_api_domain function output which includes:
- API Title and Description
- Total Endpoints count
- HTTP Methods used
- Common Path Patterns
- Main Resources identified

Endpoints Available: Complete Swagger documentation with all endpoint details including:
{{ endpoints }}

# Limit for token efficiency

Generate a Python file with domain-specific user flow classes that extend the base CustomUserFlow. Focus on realistic business workflows that users would actually perform.

Requirements:
1. Create 2-3 domain-specific flow classes based on the identified main resources
2. Use sequential tasks for related API calls and use correlation between them
3. To check payload and update it if it is not valid using the Swagger schemas
4. Each flow should represent a complete business process workflow
5. Include proper error handling and realistic wait times
6. Use the available endpoints from Swagger documentation in logical sequences
7. Add meaningful logging and data tracking
8. Parse Swagger schemas to generate valid request payloads
9. Implement data correlation (e.g., use created resource IDs in subsequent calls)
10. Add requirement sent by developer:{{ custom_requirement }}
