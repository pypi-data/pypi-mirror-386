"""
OTPyLib is built on top of the AnyIO async library, therefore it is compatible with asyncio and trio libraries.

.. _anyio: https://anyio.readthedocs.io

This library revolves around the folllwing concepts:

 - a Node represent a single asynchronous loop (`trio.run`)
 - an application represent the root of a supervision tree
 - a supervisor handles automatic restart of child processes
 - a mailbox enables message passing between asynchronous tasks

On top of this concepts, this library provides:

 - generic servers to handle requests from other tasks
 - dynamic supervisors to schedule new tasks

   **NB:** You don't get distributed computing out of the box like you would
   with Erlang_/Elixir_, this library is single-threaded and works within a
   Python application only.
