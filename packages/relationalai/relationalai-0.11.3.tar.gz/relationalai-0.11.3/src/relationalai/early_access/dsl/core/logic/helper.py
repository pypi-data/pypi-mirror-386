# Given a LogicFragment of the form:
#
#     (bvars: sconsts & atoms)
#
# where:
#
#   - bvars is a set of (Scalar) bound variable declarations,
#   - sconsts is a dictionary of ScalarConstraints, and
#   - atoms is a dictionary of AtomicConstraints
#
# Note that constraints in sconsts and/or atoms could refer to *free variables*,
# i.e., ScalarVariables that are not in bvars. We use type constraints on free
# variables when reasoning to help check domain constraints on bound variables.
#
# This function folds constraints and applies the one-point rule where possible to
# generate a hopefully simpler but equivalent fragment (bvars' : sconsts' & atoms')
# where:
#
#    - |bvars'| <= |bvars|
#    - |sconsts'| <= |sconsts|
#
# Recall the formal definition of the one-point rule:
#
#       exists(x in D : P and (x=t) )
#      =============================== [one-point]
#             t in D and P[t/x]
#
# To apply it, we take advantage of the fact that constant folding will often do
# most of the substitution work (i.e., P[t/x]) for ScalarConstraints of the form:
#
#     x == t
#
# which means we can apply the rule by merely removing such constraints (and in
# some cases also the variable ScalarVariable x) provided that we can stacially
# check that t is in D, where D is the (value-) type of ScalarVariable x. This
# check is called the "domain check" on t. Note that we cannot always statically
# discharge the domain check.
