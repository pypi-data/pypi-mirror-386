    Pass to denormalize relations, grouping relations that have the same entity as key.

    General algorithm:

    1. when handling the Model, go to its relations and find the ones that have common
    entity keys. They will be denormalized (joined together as a single "table").
    2. when handling lookups and updates that refer to one of these relations that were
    denormalized, change the reference to be to the new relation and fill the blanks with
    Nones, which represent NULLs.
    3. finally, when handling Logical nodes, try to group together lookups and updates that
    are refering to the same denormalized relation. This may remove some of the NULLs.
