# Email Contacts
A list of email contacts for the selected person/company saved in the database. Email contacts will also include data from a person's primary employer. If the person has no primary employer it will include email addresses from every one of its employers.

## Columns:
Each column title has three lines on the right if you hover over it. Click on them to show options for that column. The second tab of the options menu will allow you to filter the column, the third to completely hide entire columns. Click on anywhere else on the column to order it, cycling between ascending, descending and no ordering. Hold shift while clicking to order multiple columns with individual weights.

### Location:
The contact's location of use. Can be one of four locations: Work, Private, Home or Other. Work will be selected by default when creating a new contact.

### Email address:

## Legend:
