# image_vision

**Image Vision** is a sub-tool in the Venice Image suite that provides highly detailed, comprehensive, AI-generated textual descriptions of images. It is designed for analyzing and summarizing the visual content of any image accessible via URL.

---

## What does it do?

This tool uses Venice AI’s latest visual-language model (`qwen-2.5-vl`) to “see” an image as a human or curator would. It returns a paragraph-length, multi-faceted, exhaustive description covering:

- All visible objects and their properties (colors, shapes, count, arrangement)
- Scene composition: spatial arrangement, relationships, perspective
- Surface textures, materials, lighting, color palette
- Contextual, stylistic, or artistic features (e.g., “art deco style,” “digital illustration”)
- Mood, visual storytelling elements, or any notable anomalies
- Additional inferred details where possible

This tool is ideal for accessibility, archiving, content discovery, search, and cognitive AI workflows.

## Input

| Field        | Type     | Description                                                         | Required |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| image_url    | HttpUrl  | Publicly accessible URL to the target image.                        | Yes      |

Example:
```json
{
  "image_url": "https://example.com/some_picture.jpg"
}
```

---

## Example Output

A typical result will be a dictionary with the generated description under a relevant key (the raw API response may vary based on Venice formats):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": "A vibrant, high-resolution digital illustration depicting a Venetian canal at midday. The scene features pastel-hued buildings on either side of the canal with ornate balconies and open shuttered windows. Gondolas and small boats glide over the calm, reflective water, casting rippling shadows. The sky is clear and blue, with sunlight streaming across the facades, creating sharp contrasts and lively reflections. Crowds of tourists are visible on the far bank, while colorful banners and flowerpots accent the architecture. The composition is balanced, with attention to perspective and depth, and the general mood is lively and picturesque."
}
```

In case of errors (invalid URL, fetch issues, inappropriate filetype, etc.), a descriptive error message is returned:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Failed to fetch or validate image from URL: https://example.com/broken.jpg",
  "result": null
}
```

## Typical Use Cases

- **Accessibility:** Generate alt-text for visually impaired users.
- **AI Agents:** Understand and react to visual content in workflow automations.
- **Search & Tagging:** Automatically caption and index photo libraries.
- **Content Moderation:** Pre-screen or context-check image uploads.
- **Educational Tools:** Explain or transcribe visual materials for students.

---

## Advanced Notes

- The tool only works with image URLs that are publicly accessible and in a common web format (JPG, PNG, etc).
- Image URLs are validated and, where necessary, format-normalized using Pillow.
- The system never stores or caches the image, but will download it temporarily for analysis.

**Model Details**  
Venice AI leverages licensed large vision-language models; this tool currently uses `qwen-2.5-vl`, known for dense, multi-aspect, human-like image explanations.

## Configuration Options

- No special options; inherits API key, safe mode, and base logging from the main suite configuration.

---

## Limitations

- May not detect “hidden” content, steganographic messages, or small details lost in low-res images.
- Will describe as best possible—if the image is blank, corrupted, or unrelated, a best-effort bland description may be given.
- Not a content moderator—use with your own safety checks if required.

## Example Usage (Pseudo-code)
```python
result = await agent.send_tool(
    "image_vision",
    {
        "image_url": "https://mycdn.com/image.jpg"
    }
)
desc = result["result"]
```
