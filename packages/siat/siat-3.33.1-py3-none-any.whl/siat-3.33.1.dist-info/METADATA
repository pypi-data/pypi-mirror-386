# What is siat?
siat is a Python 3 plug-in for security investment analysis, primarily designed for teaching and learning purposes in universities for undergraduate and postgraduate programs.

siat is recommended to run in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, and most of its results are in the forms of figures and/or tables.
# Version naming
Version structure: X.Y.Z

X is the major version for architecture upgrade only.
Y is the functional version for functional enhancements.
Z is the minor version just for bug fixing.

# Quick examples of using siat


```python
# Enable siat
from siat import *
```


```python
# Set language to English, default is Chinese
set_language("English")
```

## Example 1: Apple stock price for the recent month


```python
# Simple way: show Apple's stock price in recent month
apple=security_trend("AAPL")
```
You may expect more information, such as price trend in a recent year (MRY), with the high/low point, current price and average price, like below:

```python
apple=security_trend("AAPL", start="MRY",
                     mark_top=True, mark_bottom=True, mark_end=True,
                     average_value=True)
```

## Example 2: Comparing Price changes among Apple, Microsoft and NVidia 
You may expect compare the price changes for the recent quarter (MRQ) for the three stocks.

Since there is a major stock split for NVidia in 2024 by 1:10, it is necessary to use adjusted prices (Adj Close) to compare these stock prices.

```python
comp=security_trend(['AAPL','MSFT','NVDA'], 
                    start='MRQ', 
                    indicator='Adj Close', 
                    preprocess='scaling', #use scaling drawing method to avoid loss of details
                    mark_top=True, mark_bottom=True, 
                    annotate=True, annotate_value=True)
```

## Example 4: Bollinger band for Apple in the recent quarter


```python
# security_technical only supports 4 popular technical indicators: MACD, Bollinger, KDJ and RSI. 
apple=security_technical("AAPL",
                         technical="Bollinger",
                         start="MRQ",
                         facecolor="white",
                         loc1="upper left", loc2="lower right")
```

## Example 5: CCI for Apple in recent quarter


```python
# security_technical2 supports up to 14 popular technical indicators.
# security_technical2 uses a simplied drawing method (Dehong graph) to avoid trypophobia [ˌtrɪpəu'fəʊbjə]
apple=security_technical2("AAPL",
                         technical="CCI",
                         start="MRM",
                         loc1="upper left", loc2="lower right")
```

# How to install siat?
The author strongly recommends using siat together with Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab in Anaconda.
In order to install siat for the very first time, open a Jupyter Notebook, and type in the following command:

!pip install siat

If the above method does not work, something might be wrong in your Python path settings. Try to open an Anaconda Prompt in Windows or a Terminal App in Mac or Linux, and type in the following command:

pip install siat
# How to upgrade siat?
In Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

upgrade_siat()

If you suffer from slow internet connection (often in campus classrooms with many students), try to use alternative sources, such as:

upgrade_siat(alternative="tsinghua")

upgrade_siat(alternative="alibaba")

If the above methods do not work for your environment, you have to goto the traditional ways to use command-line script, such as:

pip install --upgrade siat

*** For users in China
The pypi mirror websites may provide siat installing and upgrading in a much faster speed in the following commands: taking aliyun as an example

pip install siat -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/

pip install --upgrade siat https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/

*** Warning
1. The pip command itself may need upgrade as well.
2. The pip command sometimes may have conflicts with some vpn programs.
If in this case, try quit vpn program first, and try again. 
# Are there more detailed case studies on using siat?
YES!

There are hundreds of video case studies in the author's channel (most in Chinese, some in English).
