    Adapt ``pickle.load``.

    This function aims to provide additional flexibility for callers to load from files in the following ways:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       multistorageclient.pickle.load(multistorageclient.open(file_path_with_msc_protocol, "rb"))
       multistorageclient.pickle.load(file_path_with_msc_protocol)

    User can also use native pickle function to achieve the same goal:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

        pickle.load(multistorageclient.open(file_path_with_msc_protocol, "rb"))

    User, however, cannot directly pass the file object as the msc-prefixed file path cannot be used by native
    ``open()`` i.e. ``multistorageclient.pickle.load(open(file_path_with_msc_protocol, "rb"))``

    Alternatively, user can use native pickle dump, but need to close the file to proactively trigger file upload:

    elif isinstance(file_path, MultiStoragePath):
