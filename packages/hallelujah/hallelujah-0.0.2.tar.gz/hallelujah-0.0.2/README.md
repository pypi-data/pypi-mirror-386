# The Minimum Vertex Cover Problem

The **Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC)** problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and graph theory. It involves finding the smallest set of vertices in a graph that **covers** all edges, meaning at least one endpoint of every edge is included in the set.

## Formal Definition

Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, a **vertex cover** is a subset $V' \subseteq V$ such that for every edge $(u, v) \in E$, at least one of $u$ or $v$ belongs to $V'$. The MVC problem seeks the vertex cover with the smallest cardinality.

## Importance and Applications

- **Theoretical Significance:** MVC is a well-known NP-hard problem, central to complexity theory.
- **Practical Applications:**
  - **Network Security:** Identifying critical nodes to disrupt connections.
  - **Bioinformatics:** Analyzing gene regulatory networks.
  - **Wireless Sensor Networks:** Optimizing sensor coverage.

## Related Problems

- **Maximum Independent Set:** The complement of a vertex cover.
- **Set Cover Problem:** A generalization of MVC.

## Problem Statement

Input: A Boolean Adjacency Matrix $M$.

Answer: Find a Minimum Vertex Cover.

### Example Instance: 5 x 5 matrix

|        | c1  | c2  | c3  | c4  | c5  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **r1** | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| **r2** | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| **r3** | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| **r4** | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| **r5** | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   |

The input for undirected graph is typically provided in [DIMACS](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges) format. In this way, the previous adjacency matrix is represented in a text file using the following string representation:

```
p edge 5 4
e 1 3
e 1 5
e 2 4
e 3 5
```

This represents a 5x5 matrix in DIMACS format such that each edge $(v,w)$ appears exactly once in the input file and is not repeated as $(w,v)$. In this format, every edge appears in the form of

```
e W V
```

where the fields W and V specify the endpoints of the edge while the lower-case character `e` signifies that this is an edge descriptor line.

_Example Solution:_

Vertex Cover Found `1, 2, 3`: Nodes `1`, `2`, and `3` constitute an optimal solution.

# Compile and Environment

## Prerequisites

- Python â‰¥ 3.12

## Installation

```bash
pip install hallelujah
```

## Execution

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frankvegadelgado/hallelujah.git
   cd hallelujah
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   pray -i ./benchmarks/testMatrix1
   ```

   utilizing the `pray` command provided by Hallelujah's Library to execute the Boolean adjacency matrix `hallelujah\benchmarks\testMatrix1`. The file `testMatrix1` represents the example described herein. We also support `.xz`, `.lzma`, `.bz2`, and `.bzip2` compressed text files.

   **Example Output:**

   ```
   testMatrix1: Vertex Cover Found 1, 2, 3
   ```

   This indicates nodes `1, 2, 3` form a vertex cover.

## Vertex Cover Size

Use the `-c` flag to count the nodes in the vertex cover:

```bash
pray -i ./benchmarks/testMatrix2 -c
```

**Output:**

```
testMatrix2: Vertex Cover Size 6
```
