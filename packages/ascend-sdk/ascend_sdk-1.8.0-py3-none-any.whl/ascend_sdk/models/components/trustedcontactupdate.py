    In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process.

    Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as  https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of  fields outside countries where that field is used.

    - is not designed for efficient storage - may not be suitable for dialing - specialized libraries (see references)  should be used to parse the number for that purpose

    To do something meaningful with this number, such as format it for various use-cases, convert it to an `i18n.phonenumbers.PhoneNumber` object first.

    For instance, in Java this would be:

    com.google.type.PhoneNumber wireProto =    com.google.type.PhoneNumber.newBuilder().build();  com.google.i18n.phonenumbers.Phonenumber.PhoneNumber phoneNumber =    PhoneNumberUtil.getInstance().parse(wireProto.getE164Number(), \"ZZ\");  if (!wireProto.getExtension().isEmpty()) {   phoneNumber.setExtension(wireProto.getExtension());  }
