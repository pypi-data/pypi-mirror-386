    In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process.

    Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as  https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of  fields outside countries where that field is used.
