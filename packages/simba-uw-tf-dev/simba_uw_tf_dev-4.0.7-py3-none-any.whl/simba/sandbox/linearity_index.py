    """
    Calculates the Linearity Index (Path Straightness) over a sliding window for a path represented by an array of points.

    The Linearity Index measures how straight a path is by comparing the straight-line distance between the start and end points of each window to the total distance traveled along the path.

    :param np.ndarray x: An (N, M) array representing the path, where N is the number of points and M is the number of spatial dimensions (e.g., 2 for 2D or 3 for 3D). Each row represents the coordinates of a point along the path.
    :param float x: The size of the sliding window in seconds. This defines the time window over which the linearity index is calculated. The window size should be specified in seconds.
    :param float sample_rate: The sample rate in Hz (samples per second), which is used to convert the window size from seconds to frames.
    :return: A 1D array of length N, where each element represents the linearity index of the path within a sliding  window. The value is a ratio between the straight-line distance and the actual path length for each window. Values range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfectly straight path.
