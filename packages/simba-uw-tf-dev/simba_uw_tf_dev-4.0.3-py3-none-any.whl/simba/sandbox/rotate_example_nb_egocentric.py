# Egocentric alignment is a crucial preprocessing step with various applications across different domains.

# One primary use case is in unsupervised deep learning scenarios, where images of animals are used as inputs to train algorithms.
# Standardizing the orientation of the subject (e.g., an animal) ensures that the model and subsequent analyses do not incorrectly interpret the same behavior in different orientations
# # (e.g., grooming while facing north versus south) as distinct behaviors. By aligning the animal to a consistent frame of reference, we eliminate orientation as a confounding variable.

# While egocentric alignment is an essential first step, it is often insufficient by itself for comprehensive analyses. Additional preprocessing steps are typically required, such as:
#
# * Background subtraction to isolate the animal from its surroundings (see relevant methods and notebooks).
# *  Geometric segmentation to slice out and focus on the subject's body parts (see associated code and notebooks).

# In this notebook, we will focus exclusively on performing egocentric alignment. Further preprocessing steps are outlined in related materials.
