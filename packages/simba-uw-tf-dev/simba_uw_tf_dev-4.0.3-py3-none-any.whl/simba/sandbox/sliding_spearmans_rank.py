    """
    Computes the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between two 1D arrays `x` and `y`
    over sliding windows of size `time_window * sample_rate`. The computation is performed
    in batches to optimize memory usage, leveraging GPU acceleration with CuPy.

    .. math::
       \rho = 1 - \frac{6 \sum d_i^2}{n_w(n_w^2 - 1)}

    .. math::
        The function uses CuPy to perform GPU-accelerated calculations. Ensure that your environment
        supports GPU computation with CuPy installed.

    Where:
    - \( \rho \) is the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
    - \( d_i \) is the difference between the ranks of corresponding elements in the sliding window.
    - \( n_w \) is the size of the sliding window.

    :param np.ndarray x: The first 1D array containing the values for Feature 1.
    :param np.ndarray y: The second 1D array containing the values for Feature 2.
    :param float time_window: The size of the sliding window in seconds.
    :param int sample_rate: The sampling rate (samples per second) of the data.
    :param Optional[int] batch_size: The size of each batch to process at a time for memory efficiency. Defaults to 1.6e7.
    :return: A 1D numpy array containing the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for each sliding window.
    :rtype: np.ndarray

    >>> x = np.array([9, 10, 13, 22, 15, 18, 15, 19, 32, 11])
