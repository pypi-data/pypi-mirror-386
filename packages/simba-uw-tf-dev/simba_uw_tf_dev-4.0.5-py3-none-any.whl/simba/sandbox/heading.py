    """
    Calculates the sliding bearing (direction) of movement in degrees for a sequence of 2D points representing a single body-part.

    .. note::
       To calculate frame-by-frame bearing, pass fps == 1 and lag == 1.

    :param np.ndarray x: An array of shape (n, 2) representing the time-series sequence of 2D points.
    :param float lag: The lag time (in seconds) used for calculating the sliding bearing. E.g., if 1, then bearing will be calculated using coordinates in the current frame vs the frame 1s previously.
    :param float fps: The sample rate (frames per second) of the sequence.
    :return np.ndarray: An array containing the sliding bearings (in degrees) for each point in the sequence.

    >>> x = np.array([[10, 10], [20, 10]])
    >>> sliding_bearing(x=x, lag=1, fps=1)
