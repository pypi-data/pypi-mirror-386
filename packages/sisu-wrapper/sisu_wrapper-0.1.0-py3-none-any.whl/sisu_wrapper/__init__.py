Aalto University Sisu API Wrapper

A lightweight Python wrapper for fetching course data from the Aalto
University Sisu API.

Limitations:
    - Location/venue information is not available through the public API
    - Only published, upcoming/recent course realisations are included
    - Historical realisations require different endpoints

Example:
    >>> from sisu_wrapper import SisuClient, SisuService
    >>> with SisuClient() as client:
    ...     service = SisuService(client)
    ...     groups = service.fetch_study_groups(
    ...         "aalto-OPINKOHD-1125839311-20210801",
    ...         "aalto-CUR-206690-3122470"
    ...     )
