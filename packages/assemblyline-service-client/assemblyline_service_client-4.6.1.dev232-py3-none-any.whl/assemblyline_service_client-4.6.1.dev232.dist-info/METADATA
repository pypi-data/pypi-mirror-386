# Assemblyline 4 - Service Client

The service client fetches tasks from the service server and drops them into a directory. It will then wait for output file(s) produced by the service. This allows the service to run independently in Python3, Python2, Java, C++, etc. A service will monitor a directory for a file with it's associated task.json, will process it and drop a result.json file which the service_client can in turn pick up to send back to the service_server.
