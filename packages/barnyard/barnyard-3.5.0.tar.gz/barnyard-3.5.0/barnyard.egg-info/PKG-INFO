# 🐴 BarnYard: Temporary Delete System for Safe Batch Automation

BarnYard is a lightweight Python engine for safely distributing and processing leads or records across multiple concurrent automation scripts without data loss or duplication.

It introduces a temporary delete system that ensures a record is only removed when the task is truly complete. This protects your data even if crashes, force stops, or network interruptions occur.

---

## Why BarnYard

In typical automation, you pull a record from a shared source such as SQL or CSV and delete it immediately to prevent other bots from processing the same record.

That works, but only until something goes wrong.

### The Problem

If your automation:

* Crashes mid task,
* Is force stopped,
* Or times out midway,

Then that deleted record is gone forever even though the task never finished.

If you do not delete at all, you will have the opposite issue: duplicate processing by multiple bots.

This tension between safety and concurrency is what BarnYard solves.

---

## 💡 The BarnYard Solution

BarnYard replaces immediate deletion with a smarter two-phase delete system.

1. **Temporary checkout**
   When a lead is fetched, it is moved into a local barn (your workspace).
   This prevents duplicates but keeps it recoverable if something goes wrong.

2. **Conditional delete**

   * If the task completes, the lead is shed (permanently removed).
   * If the process fails, the lead is reinstated later for retry.

This ensures no record is ever lost or processed twice even when multiple scripts run in parallel.

---

## How It Works

Each BarnYard instance, called an Engine, manages two local databases:

| File               | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<barn>`           | The main barn containing active leads currently being processed.        |
| `<barn>_reinstate` | The reinstate barn holding leads that expired or failed and need retry. |

---

## ✅ What You Get

| Feature              | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Zero data loss**   | Records only delete after confirmed success.                 |
| **Crash recovery**   | Reinstates unprocessed leads after failure.                  |
| **Parallel safety**  | Multiple bots can safely share one data source.              |
| **Local first**      | Runs completely offline without Redis, servers, or queues.   |
| **Tunable safety**   | Adjust `batch` and `calls` to balance speed and reliability. |
| **Clear visibility** | Built-in display system shows barn activity in real time.    |

---

## Philosophy: High Scale, Low Cost

BarnYard follows a simple philosophy:
**Build automation that is affordable, failure tolerant, and massively scalable using only local resources.**

It gives you queue level safety and concurrency control without needing servers or message brokers.

It is ideal for freelancers, small teams, or large environments running multiple headless bots.

---

# The Lead Model

A **lead** (or record) is any list of values representing one unit of work:

```python
["John Doe", "Premium", 27]
```

BarnYard automatically assigns each lead a unique integer key (ID) behind the scenes, keeping it safe and traceable.

---

# 🚀 The Engine Class

The Engine class is your main entry point. It controls how barns are created, managed, and displayed.

---

### 1. Initialize

```python
import barnyard

barn = barnyard.Engine("my_barn")
```

This creates or attaches to a barn named `"my_barn"`.

You can enable or disable display logs globally by setting the `display` parameter:

```python
barn = barnyard.Engine("my_barn", display=True)  # show logs
barn = barnyard.Engine("my_barn", display=False) # silent mode
```

---

### 2. Define a Fetch Function

Your `add` function must return a list of leads (lists of values). BarnYard handles key assignment internally.

```python
def fetch_leads():
    return [
        ["Alice", "Math", 20],
        ["Bob", "Science", 22],
        ["Charlie", "History", 19],
    ]
```

---

### 3. Fetch Leads Using `next()`

`batch` defaults to `None`, so you can skip it to enable automatic batch mode.

Example with explicit batch:

```python
leads = barn.next(add=fetch_leads, batch=3, expire=30)
```

Example skipping `batch` (automatic batch):

```python
leads = barn.next(add=fetch_leads, expire=30)
```

This:

* Pulls up to `batch` leads at once or manages batch automatically if `batch=None`.
* Temporarily removes them from the barn (safe checkout).
* Returns a list of dictionaries with `key` and `value` fields.

---

### 4. Process and Shed Safely

After successful processing:

```python
for lead_dict in leads:
    key = lead_dict['key']
    value = lead_dict['value']
    # ...process your lead...
    barn.shed(key)
```

This permanently removes the lead, ensuring it will not reappear.

---

# Batch and Calls Explained

BarnYard provides two controls that let you balance speed and safety when fetching leads.

| Parameter | Description                       | Trade Off                                                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `batch`   | Number of leads fetched at once.  | Larger batch means faster but higher risk if stopped midway. |
| `calls`   | Number of fetch cycles to repeat. | More calls means safer recovery but slower overall.          |

---

### Special Case: Using `batch=None` (Automatic Batch Mode)

If you omit `batch` or set `batch=None`, BarnYard will automatically manage the batch size for you. The logic:

* BarnYard reads the last used batch size from an internal cache file specific to your barn.
* This allows continuity across runs, so your batch size remains consistent unless you change it.
* If you call `next()` with a different batch size than cached, BarnYard will finish processing the old batch size leads before switching to the new batch size.
* This prevents mixing batches of different sizes that could cause instability or lead loss.
* The cache file is stored locally and updated automatically after each successful `next()` run.

Using `batch=None` is recommended if you want BarnYard to adapt batch size dynamically without losing safety or creating duplicates.

---

### 🧮 Example with Automatic Batch

```python
# First call sets batch to 5 (and caches it)
barn.next(add=fetch_leads, batch=5, calls=3)

# Later calls use cached batch size 5 if batch=None or omitted
barn.next(add=fetch_leads, batch=None, calls=3)
barn.next(add=fetch_leads, calls=3)  # batch omitted defaults to None

# To change batch size, specify explicitly (will finish old batch first)
barn.next(add=fetch_leads, batch=2, calls=3)
```

---

### Balancing Speed and Safety

| Situation                       | Recommended Setup     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Stable system, low crash risk   | `batch=10`, `calls=1` |
| Moderate risk, shared machine   | `batch=5`, `calls=3`  |
| High risk, unstable environment | `batch=2`, `calls=10` |

Smaller batches reduce the risk of losing leads during sudden stops, at the cost of speed.

---

### ⏳ Max Query Duration

Every BarnYard operation has a maximum query time of 60 seconds.

This prevents hangs or deadlocks if a read or write stalls because of external input or output issues.

---

# 🖥 Display System

BarnYard includes a built-in display engine that visually tracks barn activity.

---

## 🧩 How Display Works

Every Engine instance has a global display mode set when you initialize it:

```python
barn = barnyard.Engine("my_barn", display=True)
```

This acts as the default display setting for all operations on that engine.

However, every main function such as `next()`, `info()`, `find()`, and `remove()` has its own optional `display` argument (default: `None`).

| Value   | Behavior                                           |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `None`  | Inherits from the engine’s global display mode.    |
| `True`  | Forces display on for that specific function call. |
| `False` | Runs silently, overriding the engine’s default.    |

This gives you flexible control.

Keep display on globally for clarity during development.

Turn it off per function when running automation in production.

---

## Display Output Format

BarnYard logs barn activity lines with clear centered columns and status icons:

Sample output:

```
🐴          Barn: My_Barn          |         Action: Fetching New          |          Leads: 5 ✅          | 🕒 Time: 13:42:18
🐴          Barn: My_Barn          |         Action: Reinstating           |          Barn A. len: 12 ⚠️   | 🕒 Time: 13:42:48
```

The status icons (green check, yellow warning, red stop) help quickly monitor barn health.

# 📖 Example: Safe Automation Workflow

```python
import barnyard

# Initialize engine
barn = barnyard.Engine("students", display=True)

def fetch_students():
    return [
        ["Jane", "Math", 21],
        ["Chris", "English", 22],
        ["Tina", "Biology", 20],
    ]

# Step 1: Fetch new leads safely with automatic batch (batch defaults to None)
leads = barn.next(add=fetch_students, expire=30, calls=3)

# Step 2: Process safely
for lead_dict in leads:
    key = lead_dict['key']
    value = lead_dict['value']
    print("Processing:", value)
    barn.shed(key)  # Delete only after success

# Step 3: View remaining leads
barn.info()

# Step 4: Clean up barn after all work is complete
barn.remove("students")
```
