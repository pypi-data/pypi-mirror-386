    If ``uplink-status-propagation`` extension is enabled, all existing ports
    before enabling it will have the flag "propagate_uplink_status" enabled by
    default. This is aligned with the aim of an administrator that enables
    this extension. Now only new ports can be created with this flag disabled.
