    Added a new OVS agent extension ``dhcp`` to support distributed
    DHCP for VMs in compute nodes directly. To enable this just
    set ``extensions=dhcp`` to OVS agent config file under ``[agent]``
    section. We also add a new config section ``[dhcp]`` which
    has options ``enable_ipv6 = True/False`` for indicating whether
    enable the DHCPv6 for VM ports.
