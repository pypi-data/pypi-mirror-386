features:
    - Neutron allows cloud administrators to limit the rate at which VMs query
      the Nova metadata service in order to protect the OpenStack deployment
      from DoS or misbehaved instances. This new feature can be configured in
      the neutron.conf file. Please see the "Metadata service query rate
      limiting" section under Neutron configuration in the documentation for
      more details.
