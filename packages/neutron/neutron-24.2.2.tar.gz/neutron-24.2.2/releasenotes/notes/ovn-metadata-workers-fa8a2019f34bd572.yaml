    The default value for the ``metadata_workers`` configuration option
    has changed to 0 for the ML2/OVN driver. Since `[OVN] Allow to execute
    "MetadataProxyHandler" in a local thread <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron/+/861649>`_,
    the OVN metadata proxy handler can be spawned in the same process of
    the OVN metadata agent, in a local thread. That reduces the number of
    OVN SB database connections to one.
