    The ``ProcessManager`` class will now, by default, add an environment
    variable when starting a new process. This default tag is named
    "PROCESS_TAG" and will contain a unique identifier for this specific
    process. It could be used, for example, by TripleO to univocally tag
    any new container spawned and find it using the same tag.
