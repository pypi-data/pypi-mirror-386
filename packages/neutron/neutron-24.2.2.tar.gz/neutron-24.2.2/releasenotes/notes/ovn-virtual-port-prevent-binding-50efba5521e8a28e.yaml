    A ML2/OVN virtual port cannot be bound to a virtual machine. If a port
    IP address is assigned as an allowed address pair into another port, the
    first one is considered a virtual port. If the second port (non-virtual)
    is bound to ML2/OVN, the virtual port cannot be bound to a virtual
    machine; a virtual port is created only to reserve a set of IP addresses
    to be used by other ports. The OVN mechanism driver prevents that a virtual
    port has a device ID; a device ID is provided when the port is being bound.
