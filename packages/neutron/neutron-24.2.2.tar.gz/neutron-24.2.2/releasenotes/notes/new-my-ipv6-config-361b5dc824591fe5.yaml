    Add a new config option in DEFAULT section named ``my_ipv6``.
    This new config option will be set by default to the local IPv6 configured
    to reach the default gateway.
    This new setting might be useful for operators that need to configure this
    IP in another part of their config (like OVS/local_ip) without relying on
    any external templating system.
