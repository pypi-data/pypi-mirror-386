    A unique constraint for (network_id, network_type, physical_network) is
    added to the networksegments table. This was done to prevent race
    conditions on dynamic segment allocation. Operators having networks with
    multiple segments (e.g. when using hierarchical portbinding) should check
    that this constraint is not violated with the included upgrade-check.
