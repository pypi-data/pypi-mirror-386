    A new script to remove the duplicated port bindings was added. This script
    will list all ``ml2_port_bindings`` records in the database, finding those
    ones with the same port ID. Then the script removes those ones with
    status=INACTIVE. This script is useful to remove those leftovers that
    remain in the database after a failed live migration. It is important to
    remark that this script should not be executed during any live migration
    process.
