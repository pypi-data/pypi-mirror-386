    A new config option ``enable_signals`` has been added to neutron.conf to
    control whether neutron-server registers signal handlers or not (like
    SIGTERM, etc). The default value for this new option is True to mimic the
    original behavior of registering signal handlers.
    The recommendation is to set this option to False when neutron-server is
    running behind a WSGI server, because in that situation the signals are
    taken over by the WSGI server and neutron will print a stack trace letting
    us know that signals cannot be registered.
