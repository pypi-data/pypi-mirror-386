features:
  - |
    A new API which allows a cloud administrator to define their own set of
    security group rules added automatically to every new ``default`` and/or
    custom security group created for projects.
upgrade:
  - |
    During the upgrade process, a set of four default security group rules will
    be created in the Neutron database. Those rules are the same default
    rules added to every new security group up to now:

    * rule to allow all egress IPv4 traffic (for all default and custom
      Security groups),
    * rule to allow all egress IPv6 traffic (for all default and custom
      Security groups),
    * rule to allow all ingress IPv4 traffic from the same security group
      (for default security group in each project),
    * rule to allow all ingress IPv6 traffic from the same security group
      (for default security group in each project).

    Those rules can now be modified by a cloud administrator using the
    ``default-security-group-rules`` API.
