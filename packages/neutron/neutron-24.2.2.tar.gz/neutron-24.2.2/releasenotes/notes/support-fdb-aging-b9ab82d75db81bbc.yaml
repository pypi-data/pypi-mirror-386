    In OVN 22.09 the option ``localnet_learn_fdb`` was added, enabling localnet
    ports to learn MAC addresses and store them at the FDB table. There was no
    aging mechanism for those MACs until OVN 23.06, where the configuration
    option ``fdb_age_threshold`` was added. This enables to set the maximum
    time the learned MACs will stay in the FDB table (in seconds). When the
    ``localnet_learn_fdb`` configuration option is enabled, the proper value
    for ``fdb_age_threshold`` should also be set, to avoid
    performance/scalability issues due to the table growing too much --
    especially when provider networks are large. In addition the configuration
    option ``fdb_removal_limit`` was also added to avoid removing a large
    number of entries at once.
