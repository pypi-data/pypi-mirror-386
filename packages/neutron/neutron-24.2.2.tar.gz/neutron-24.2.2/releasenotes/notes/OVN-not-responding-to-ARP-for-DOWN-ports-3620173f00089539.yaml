    Starting with OVN version v21.12.0, OVN replies to ARP requests for ports
    that are in a DOWN status. It does not reply in versions older than
    v21.12.0.  In order to keep the same behavior in Neutron, the default OVN
    behavior is overridden by Neutron and Neutron ports will no longer reply to
    ARP packets if the ports are in a DOWN state. If it is required to reply to
    ARP for such ports, the config option ``ignore_lsp_down`` from
    ``[ovn_nb_global]`` section can be set to True in the Neutron config. It is
    set to False by default.
