    The Neutron service enable the API policies (RBAC) new defaults and scope
    by default. The Default value of config options
    ``[oslo_policy] enforce_scope`` and
    ``[oslo_policy] oslo_policy.enforce_new_defaults`` have been changed
    to ``True``.

    This means if you are using system scope token to access Neutron API then
    the request will be failed with 403 error code. Also, new defaults will be
    enforced by default. To know about the new defaults of each policy
    rule, refer to the `Policy New Defaults`_. For more detail about
    the Neutron API policies changes, refer to `Policy Concepts`_.

    If you want to disable them then modify the below config options value in
    ``neutron.conf`` file::

      [oslo_policy]
      enforce_new_defaults=False
      enforce_scope=False
