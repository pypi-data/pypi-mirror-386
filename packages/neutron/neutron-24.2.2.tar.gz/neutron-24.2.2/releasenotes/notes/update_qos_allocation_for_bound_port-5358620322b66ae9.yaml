    Update of an already bound port with a QoS ``minimum_bandwidth`` rule
    with a new QoS policy with a ``minimum_bandwidth`` rule now changes the
    allocations in placement as well.

    .. NOTE:: Updating the ``minimum_bandwidth`` rule of a QoS policy that
              is attached to a port which is bound to a VM is still not
              possible.
