# Name of the group hosts where the NFS instalation will take place
# If the NFS server is the undercloud (and there is only one) will
# not be a problem, but if multiple servers exist on the server_name group
# it is possible that the nfs will be installed on every server, eventho the
# storage of the backup will only be done in the backup_ip.
#
# This can be solved if a new tripleo-inventory is manually created specifying
# a [BackupNode] section, with the nfs server info
