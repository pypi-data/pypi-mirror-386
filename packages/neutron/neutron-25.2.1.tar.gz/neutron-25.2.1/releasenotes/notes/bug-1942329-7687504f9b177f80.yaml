    `1942329 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1942329>`_
    Port binding logic for direct-physical ports has been extended to allow
    providing the MAC address of the physical device via the binding profile.
    If it is provided then Neutron overwrites the value of the
    ``device_mac_address`` field of the port object in the database with the
    value from the active binding profile.
    If there are ports bound before `the nova side of this fix is depolyed
    <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova/+/829248>`_ then the VM using
    the port needs to be moved or the port needs to be detached and re-attached
    to force nova to provide the MAC address of the direct-physical port in the
    port binding.
