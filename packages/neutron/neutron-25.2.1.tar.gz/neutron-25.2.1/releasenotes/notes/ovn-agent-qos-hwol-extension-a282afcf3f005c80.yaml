    Added a new OVN Neutron Agent extension: QoS for hardware offloaded ports.
    This extension will enforce the minimum and maximum bandwidth egress QoS
    rules for ports with hardware offload (DevLink ports). This extension
    uses the "ip-link" commands to set the "ceil" and "rate" parameters on
    the corresponding virtual functions.
