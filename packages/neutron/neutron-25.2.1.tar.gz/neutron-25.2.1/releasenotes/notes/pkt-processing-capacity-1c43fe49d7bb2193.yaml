    Report packet processing capacity on the OVS agent resource provider as
    the new ``NET_PACKET_RATE_KILOPACKET_PER_SEC``,
    ``NET_PACKET_RATE_EGR_KILOPACKET_PER_SEC`` or
    ``NET_PACKET_RATE_IGR_KILOPACKET_PER_SEC`` resource inventory. This is
    similar to how the bandwidth resource is reported today. The former
    is used for non-hardware-offloaded OVS deployments, where packets
    processed from both ingress and egress directions are handled by the same
    set of CPU cores. Remaining inventories are used for hardware-offloaded
    OVS, where the incoming and outgoing packets are handled by independent
    hardware resources.
