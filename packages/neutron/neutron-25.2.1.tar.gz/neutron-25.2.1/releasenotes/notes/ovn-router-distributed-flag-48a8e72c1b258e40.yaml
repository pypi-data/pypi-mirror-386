    OVN routers now expose the "distributed" flag depending on the
    configuration option ``enable_distributed_floating_ip``. Because this is a
    common configuration option, all routers will expose the same value. This
    value can flap if the Neutron API is restarted and the configuration option
    changes.
    NOTE: Once the RFE that allows us to define the distributed flag per
    floating IP address is implemented in ML2/OVN, this flag will be useless
    (no Launchpad bug has been created yet for this RFE, that is only a
    proposed idea during several PTGs).
