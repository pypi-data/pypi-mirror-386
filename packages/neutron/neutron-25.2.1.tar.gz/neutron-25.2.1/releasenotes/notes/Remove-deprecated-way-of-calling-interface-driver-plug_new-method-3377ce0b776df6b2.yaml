    Abstract method ``plug_new`` from the
    neutron.agent.linux.interface.LinuxInterfaceDriver now has additional
    positional argument ``link_up``. Usage of this method without ``link_up``
    is now not possible.
    Third-party drivers which inherit from this base class now have to update
    the implementation of their ``plug_new`` method.
