    When using the minimim-bandwidth QoS feature due to bug
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/1921150 physical NIC resource providers
    were for some time created with the wrong parent (i.e. the
    hypervisor RP). This is now partially fixed and new resource
    providers are created now with the expected parent (i.e. the agent
    RP).  However Placement does not allow re-parenting an already
    existing resource provider, therefore the following Placement
    DB update may be needed after the fix for bug 1921150 is applied:
    neutron/tools/bug-1921150-re-parent-device-rps.sql
    Until all resource providers have the proper parent, neutron-server
    will retry the re-parenting update, which will be rejected every time,
    therefore expect polluted logs and some wasted load on Placement.
    However please note that the bandwidth-aware scheduling is supposed
    to work even with the wrongly parented resource providers.
