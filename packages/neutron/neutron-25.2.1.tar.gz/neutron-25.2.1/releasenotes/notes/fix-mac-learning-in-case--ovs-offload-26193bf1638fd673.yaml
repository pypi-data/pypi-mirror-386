    Fixed a MAC learning issue when OVS offload is enabled. The OVS firewall
    reduces the usage of normal actions to reduce CPU utilization. This
    causes insertion of a flood rule because there is no MAC learning on
    ingress traffic. While this is okay for the non-offload case, when using
    OVS offload the flood rule is not being offloaded. This fixes the MAC
    learning in the offload case, so we avoid the flood rule. For more
    information, see bug
