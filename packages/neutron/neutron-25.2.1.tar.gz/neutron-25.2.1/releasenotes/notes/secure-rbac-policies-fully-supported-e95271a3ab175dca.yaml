features:
  - |
    Neutron now supports API policies with the new default roles
    ``project_member`` and ``project_reader``.
    Role ``admin`` is working in the same way as with old policies.
upgrade:
  - |
    New default API policies are not enabled by default. A cloud operator can
    enable them by setting ``oslo_policy/enforce_new_defaults`` to ``true`` in
    the Neutron config file.
    It is also possible to switch the ``oslo_policy/enforce_scope`` config
    option to ``true`` but currently Neutron does not support any system scope
    APIs. All Neutron API policies are currently project scoped so setting
    ``oslo_policy/enforce_scope`` to ``true`` will cause ``Forbidden`` responses
    to any API calls made with the system scope token.
