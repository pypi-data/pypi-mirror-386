    Added a new process called ``neutron-periodic-workers``. This process is
    spawned when using the Neutron API WSGI module with any mechanism driver.
    It executes the ML2 plugin periodic workers that are collected by an
    instance of the class ``AllServicesNeutronWorker`` and executed as threads
    on a single worker.
