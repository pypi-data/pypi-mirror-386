features:
  - |
    The OVN L3 scheduler will assign chassis explicitly configured as gateways
    to the router gateway ports (OVN logical router ports). If no candidates are
    available, the "neutron-ovn-invalid-chassis" will be used instead and a
    warning message will be printed in the logs.
upgrade:
  - |
    In ML2/OVN, any new router gateway port (OVN logical router port) will be
    scheduled only on those chassis configured as gateway. Any existing router
    gateway port will preserve the current chassis assignation.
