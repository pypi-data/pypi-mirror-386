    Introduce the attribute ``hardware_offload_type`` to ports, that specifies
    the hardware offload type this port will request when attached to the
    network backend.

    Operators can turn on this feature via the configuration option::

      [ml2]
      extension_drivers = port_hardware_offload_type
