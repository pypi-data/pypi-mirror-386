    Now setting ``[DEFAULT] rpc_workers = 0`` completely disables rpc workers.
    In a deployment with additional agents, like the dhcp-agent, this option
    should be set to a positive value. Note that all notifications from
    neutron-server to agents were disabled when ``[DEFAULT] rpc_workers = 0``
    is set in 22.0.0 release, so this was the requiremenet actually added in
    that release.

    [`bug 2052484 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2002484>`_]
    Now setting ``[DEFAULT] rpc_workers = 0`` completely disables rpc workers.
    Previously one rpc worker was launched even though ``0`` is specifically
    requested.
