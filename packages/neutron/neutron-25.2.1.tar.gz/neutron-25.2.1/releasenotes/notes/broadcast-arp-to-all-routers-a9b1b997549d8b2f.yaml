    Added a new configuration option called
    ``broadcast_arps_to_all_routers`` to the ``[ovn]`` config section.
    This option is responsible for configuring the external networks with
    the ``broadcast-arps-to-all-routers`` config option available in
    OVN 23.06 and newer. By enabling this option (default) OVN will flood
    ARP requests to all attached ports on a network. If disabled, ARP
    requests are only sent to routers on that network if the target MAC
    address matches. ARP requests that do not match a router will only
    be forwarded to non-router ports.
