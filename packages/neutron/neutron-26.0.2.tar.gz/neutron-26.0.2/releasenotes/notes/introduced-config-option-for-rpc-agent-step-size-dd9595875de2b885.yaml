    Introduced config option for RPC agent step size customization:
    rpc_resources_processing_step - Number of resources for neutron to divide
    the large RPC call data sets. It can be reduced if RPC timeout occurred.
    Default value equals 20. The best value can be determined empirically in
    your environment.
