    Add ``enable_default_route_bfd`` and ``enable_default_route_ecmp``
    configuration options which control default behavior for enabling BFD and
    ECMP on default routes for newly created routers.  Both configuration
    options have a default value of 'False' and are only supported with the
    OVN driver.
