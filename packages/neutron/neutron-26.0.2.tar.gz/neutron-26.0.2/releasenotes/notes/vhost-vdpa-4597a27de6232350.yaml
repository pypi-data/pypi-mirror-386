    A new vnic type ``vdpa`` has been added to allow requesting port that
    utilize a vHost-vDPA offload. The ML2/OVS and ML2/OVN mech drivers now
    have support for the vHost-vDPA vnic type. vHost-vDPA is similar to
    vHost-user or kernel vhost offload but utilizes the newly added vDPA bus
    introduced in the Linux 5.7 kernel. vDPA interface can be implemented in
    software or hardware, when implemented in hardware they provide equivalent
    performance to SR-IOV or hardware offloaded OVS while providing two main
    advantages over both SR-IOV and hardware offloaded OVS. Unlike the
    alternatives, vHost-vDPA enables live migration of instance transparently
    and provides a standard virtio-net interface to the guest avoiding the
    need to install vendor specific drivers in the guest.
