    MAC address aging in the OVN ML2 mech driver is now supported and can
    be configured globally with the new ``[ovn] mac_binding_age_threshold``
    and ``[ovn_nb_global] mac_binding_removal_limit`` configuration
    options. Setting the value per-router is not currently supported. This
    feature is available in OVN versions >= 22.09.0+. Previous versions will
    ignore the new options.
