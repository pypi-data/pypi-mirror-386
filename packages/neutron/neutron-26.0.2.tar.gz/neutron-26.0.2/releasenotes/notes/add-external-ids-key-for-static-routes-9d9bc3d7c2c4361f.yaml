    The OVN ML2 mechanism driver for static routes will now include the key
    ``neutron:is_static_route`` in the external_ids register for external
    gateway router ports. This is required for the OVN DB sync tool to
    distinguish the Neutron created Static Routes from those added externally
    in the OVN database. Previously created static route rules will be updated
    only once during the maintenance task to include the
    ``neutron:is_static_route`` key in the external_ids register. In case all
    static route entries are already configured using this key, no maintenance
    action will be performed.
