    QoS rule type list accepts two filter flags:

    * ``all_supported``: if True, the listing call will print all QoS
      rule types supported by at least one loaded mechanism driver.
    * ``all_rules``: if True, the listing call will print all QoS rule
      types supported by the Neutron server.

    Both filter flags are exclusive and not required.
