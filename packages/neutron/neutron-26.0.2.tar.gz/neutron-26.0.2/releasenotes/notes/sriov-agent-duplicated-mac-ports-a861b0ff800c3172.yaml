    SR-IOV agent now can handle ports from different networks with the same
    MAC addresses. This feature implies an upgrade in the agent and the server
    RPC version (see ``neutron.plugins.ml2.rpc.RpcCallbacks`` version 1.9).
    Some agent RPC methods have been updated to pass not only the device MAC
    address but the PCI slot too. In case of having more than one port with
    the same MAC address, the PCI slot will discriminate the requested port.
upgrade:
  - |
    Both the server and the agent RPC versions have been bumped to 1.9; to
    provide a smooth upgrade transition, the `Upgrade Procedure
    <https://docs.openstack.org/operations-guide/ops-upgrades.html>`_ should
    be followed, upgrading first the servers and then the agents.
    The agent RPC methods returned values are not modified to keep
    compatibility with other agents (Linux Bridge, Open vSwitch). The RPC
    server side is capable of attending calls from agent API < 1.9, in order to
    provide backwards compatibility. If the device PCI slot is not provided,
    the behavior will be the previous one.
