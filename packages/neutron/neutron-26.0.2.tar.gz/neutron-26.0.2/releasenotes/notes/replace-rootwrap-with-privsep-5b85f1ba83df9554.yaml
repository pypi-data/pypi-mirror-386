    As defined in `Migrate from oslo.rootwrap to oslo.privsep
    <https://opendev.org/openstack/governance/src/branch/master/goals/selected/wallaby/migrate-to-privsep.rst>`_,
    all OpenStack proyects should migrate from oslo.rootwrap to oslo.privsep
    because "oslo.privsep offers a superior security model, faster and more
    secure".
    This migration will end with the deprecation and removal of oslo.rootwrap
    from Neutron. To ensure the quality of the Neutron code, this migration
    will be done sequentially in several patches, checking none of them breaks
    the current functionality.
    In order to easily migrate to execute all external commands inside a
    privsep context, a new input variable "privsep_exec", that defaults to
    "False", is added to ``neutron.agent.linux.utils.execute``. That will
    divert the code to a privsep decorated executor.
    Once the migration finishes, this new input parameter will be removed.
