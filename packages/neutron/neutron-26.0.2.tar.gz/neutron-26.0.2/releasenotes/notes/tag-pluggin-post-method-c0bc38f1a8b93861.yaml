    Added a new shim extension ``tag-creation``. This extension informs about
    a new API definition in the tag plugin that allows to send ``POST``
    requests. Now it is possible to create new tags, passing the value of the
    tags as an argument of the call. That resolves formatting issues when
    using URI reserved characters.
