    Added support in SR-IOV agent for ``accelerator-direct`` VNIC
    type. This type represents a port that supports any kind of
    hardware acceleration and is provided by Cyborg
    (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cyborg). `RFE: 1909100
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1909100>`_.
    ``accelerator-direct-physical`` is still not supported.
