    Adds support for Network Availability Zones to the OVN driver. When
    Network AZ is used, OVN's "external" ports will now be scheduled
    onto nodes belonging to the AZs specified in the network that the
    port belongs to. This feature also removes the limitation where all
    "external" ports were part of to a single HA Chassis Group (meaning
    they would all be bond to a single host) now the "external" ports
    will be better distributed across different hosts.
