    A new subnet of type ``network:routed`` has been added. If such a subnet is
    used, the IPs of that subnet will be advertized with BGP over a provider
    network, which itself can use segments. This basically achieves a
    BGP-to-the-rack feature, where the L2 connectivity can be confined to a
    rack only, and all external routing is done by the switches, using BGP.
    In this mode, it is still possible to use VXLAN connectivity between the
    compute nodes, and only floating IPs and router gateways are using BGP
    routing.
