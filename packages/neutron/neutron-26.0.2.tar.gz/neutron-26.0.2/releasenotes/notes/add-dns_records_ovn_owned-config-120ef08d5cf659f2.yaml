    For OVN version 24.03 and above you can now configure DNS records to be
    local to OVN by setting the new configuration option
    ``[ovn]dns_records_ovn_owned``.
    If this option is set to True, DNS records will be treated local to the OVN
    controller and it will respond to the queries for the records and record
    types known to it, else it will forward them to the configured DNS server(s).
    For more information, see bug
    `2059405 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2059405>`_.
    Default is False.
