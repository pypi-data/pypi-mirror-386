    Since OVN 23.06.0 the QoS enforcement for maximum bandwidth and minimum
    bandwidth rules on Logical_Switch_Ports connected to Logical_Switch with
    localnet ports (that means ports connected to provider type networks) is
    done in this localnet port connected to the physical bridge, via TC
    commands. To meet that goal it is needed to define the maximum bandwidth
    and minimum bandwidth rules in the Logical_Switch_Port ``options``
    dictionary field, using the keys ``qos_min_rate``, ``qos_max_rate`` and
    ``qos_burst``.
