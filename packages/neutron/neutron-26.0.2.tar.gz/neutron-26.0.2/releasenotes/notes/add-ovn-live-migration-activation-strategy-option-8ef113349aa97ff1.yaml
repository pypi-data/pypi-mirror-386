    For OVN, you can now select which port binding activation strategy to use
    for migrated ports, by setting the new configuration option
    ``[ovn]ovn_live_migration_activation_strategy``. If set to an empty string,
    no activation strategy will be used, and the destination port binding will
    be immediately activated after creation without waiting for migration to
    complete.
