upgrade:
  - |
    The ``[DEFAULT] api_workers`` option no longer accepts 0 or negative
    values. Previously 0 or a negative value was translated to 1 and
    neutron-server launched 1 api worker.

  - |
    The ``[DEFAULT] rpc_workers`` option and
    the ``[DEFAULT] rpc_state_report_workers`` option no longer accept negative
    values. To disable these workers, set these options to 0.
