    The ``network_segment_ranges`` registers are now initialized based on the
    Neutron API start time. The type driver class cleans up the database
    for those registers not matching the network type and the "created_at"
    timestamp and uses the process-safe method
    ``NetworkSegmentRange.new_default`` to create the new registers.
