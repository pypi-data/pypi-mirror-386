    Added a check to verify if all rows of ``ml2_port_bindings`` table in the
    DB are using the new format for ``profile`` column. This check is part of
    upgrade check, that can be executed with ``neutron-status upgrade check``
    command. If some rows are using obsolete format, they can be sanitized
    with a script that can be executed with
    ``neutron-sanitize-port-binding-profile-allocation`` command.
