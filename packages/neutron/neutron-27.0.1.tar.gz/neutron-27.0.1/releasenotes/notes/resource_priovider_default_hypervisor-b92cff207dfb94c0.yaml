    The new ``resource_provider_defualt_hypervisor`` option has been added,
    to replace the default hypervisor name to locates the root resource
    provider without giving a complete list of interfaces or bridges in
    the ``resource_provider_hypervisors`` option. This option is located in
    the ``[ovs]`` ini-section for ``ovs-agent`` and ``[sriov_nic]`` ini-section
    for ``sriov-agent``.
