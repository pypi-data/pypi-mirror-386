features:
  - |
    Support for baremetal provisioning using OVN's built-in DHCP server
    has been added for IPv4.
upgrade:
  - |
    A new configuration option called
    ``[ovn]/disable_ovn_dhcp_for_baremetal_ports`` has been added to
    ML2/OVN for IPv4. Since PXE booting nodes can be very sensitive
    depending on the hardware and some operators may prefer to use a
    fully-fledged DHCP server instead of OVN's DHCP server this option
    allows for disabling OVN's built-in DHCP server for baremetal ports
    (vnic type "baremetal") when set to True. It defaults to False.
