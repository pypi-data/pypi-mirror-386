    ML2/OVS and ML2/OVN now support modelling tunnelled networks in the
    Placement API. The "tunnelled_network_rp_name" configuration option
    defines the resource provider name used to represent all tunnelled
    networks in a compute node (by default "rp_tunnelled"). If this string
    is present in the "resource_provider_bandwidths" dictionary, the
    corresponding mechanism driver will create a resource provider for
    the overlay traffic.
