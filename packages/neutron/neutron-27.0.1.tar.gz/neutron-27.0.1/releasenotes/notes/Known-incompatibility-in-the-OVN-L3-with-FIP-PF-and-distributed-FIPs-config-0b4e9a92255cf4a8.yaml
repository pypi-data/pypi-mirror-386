    When ``ML2/OVN`` backend and it's L3 service plugin (``ovn-router``) are
    used together with "vlan" or "flat" network types used as tenant network
    type, floating IP port forwarding (FIP PF) will not work if distributed
    Floating IPs are enabled (``enable_distributed_floating_ip`` = ``True``).
    To workaround this issue one of the following changes needs to be done:

    * tunnel networks ("geneve" or "vxlan") should be used as tenant network types or
    * Floating IPs should be centralized (``enable_distributed_floating_ip`` = ``False``).
