    Added a new config option ``enable_traditional_dhcp`` for neutron server,
    if it is set to False, neutron server will disable DHCP provisioning
    block, DHCP scheduler API extension, network scheduling mechanism and
    DHCP RPC/notification. This option can be used with the
    ``dhcp`` extension of the OVS agent to enable distributed DHCP, or
    for a deployment which needs
    to disable the DHCP agent related functions permanently.
