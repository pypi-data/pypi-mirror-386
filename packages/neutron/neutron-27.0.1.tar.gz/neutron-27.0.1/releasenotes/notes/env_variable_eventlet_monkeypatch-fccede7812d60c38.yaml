    ``EVENTLET_MONKEYPATCH=1`` can be defined to get patching as early as
    possible in Python startup.

    Neutron can read the environment variable ``EVENTLET_MONKEYPATCH=1`` in
    order to not monkey patch the system libraries. If this environment
    variable is set and the eventlet version is lower, the process won't be
    patched.
