    The ML2/OVN Placement initial configuration is executed now in the Neutron
    API process and removed from the maintenance worker; since the migration
    to WSGI, now the API and the maintenance worker are different processes.
    When an OVN ``Chassis`` creation event is received, the configuration is
    read, a ``PlacementState`` object created and sent to the Placement API.
