    OVN mechanism driver has now got config option
    ``allow_stateless_action_supported`` which allows manually disable
    ``stateful-security-group`` API extension in case when OVN older than 21.06
    is used because support for ``allow-stateful`` action in OVN's ACL was
    added in OVN 21.06.
    By default this option is set to ``True`` so ``stateful-security-group``
    API extension is enabled.
    If this option is set to ``True`` and OVN < 21.06 is used, Neutron will
    fallback to the statefull ACLs even if SG is set to be stateless in Neutron
    database.
