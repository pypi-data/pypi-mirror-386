    - A new sample OVN user defined router flavor driver has been added that
      enables the creation of router interfaces with no associated underlying
      Logical Switch Ports. In this scenario, Neutron only acts as the
      IP address manager for the router interfaces. This enables user defined
      router flavors to have total control of the traffic traversing the
      router interfaces while bypassing the OVN processing.
