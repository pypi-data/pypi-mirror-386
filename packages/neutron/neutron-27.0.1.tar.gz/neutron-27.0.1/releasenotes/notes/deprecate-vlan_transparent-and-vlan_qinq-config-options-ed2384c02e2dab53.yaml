deprecations:
  - |
    Config options ``vlan_transparent`` and ``vlan_qinq`` are now deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release. Availability of the ``vlan-transparent``
    and ``vlan-qinq`` API extensions can now be calculated by Neutron based on the
    mechanism drivers enabled in the environment. If any of the enabled
    mechanism drivers do not support these features, the API extensions will be
    disabled automatically.
