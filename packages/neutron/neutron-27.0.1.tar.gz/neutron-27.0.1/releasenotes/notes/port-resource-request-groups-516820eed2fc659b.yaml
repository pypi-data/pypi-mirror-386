    Added port-resource-request-groups API extension, that provides support for
    the new format of port's ``resource_request`` and
    ``binding:profile.allocation`` attributes. The new format allows to request
    multiple groups of resources and traits from the same RP subtree.

    Assigning a new ``QoS policy`` with ``minimum_packet_rate`` rule to an
    ``already bound port`` updates the allocation in Placement.
    ``NOTE``: Placement allocation update is not supported if original QoS
    policy had no ``minimum_packet_rate`` rule. Changing from direction-less
    ``minimum_packet_rate`` rule to a direction-oriented
    ``minimum_packet_rate`` rule is not supported.
