    A new openvswitch agent extension ``metadata_path`` was added to implement
    a distributed approach for virtual machines to retrieve metadata in
    each running host without a traditional metadata-agent and its dependent
    router or DHCP namespace.
    For a new host, users need to create the OVS bridge
    named ``br-meta``. The OVS-agent will implicitly add an entry
    ``meta:br-meta`` to the list of ``bridge_mappings``.
    New config options ``provider_cidr``, ``provider_vlan_id``,
    ``provider_base_mac`` and ``host_proxy_listen_port`` are added to the
    openvswitch agent ``[METADATA]`` section.
