    For IPv4 subnets when dns_nameservers is not set in the subnet,
    servers defined in 'ovn/dns_servers' config option or system's
    resolv.conf are used, but for IPv6 subnets these are
    not used. The same will now be used for IPv6 subnets too.
    Additionally dns servers added in 'ovn/dns_servers' config
    option or system's resolv.conf will be filtered as per
    the subnet's IP version. For more info see the bug report
    `1951816 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1951816>`_.
