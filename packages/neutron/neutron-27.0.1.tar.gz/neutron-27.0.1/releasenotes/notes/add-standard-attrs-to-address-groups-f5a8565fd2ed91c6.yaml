    Address group now has standard attributes. In the alembic migration,
    the original ``description`` column of ``address_groups`` is dropped after
    data migrated to the ``standardattributes`` table. The ``description``
    field is also removed from the address group object and DB model. This
    change requires a restart of ``neutron-server`` service after the DB
    migration otherwise users will get server errors when making calls to
    address group APIs.
