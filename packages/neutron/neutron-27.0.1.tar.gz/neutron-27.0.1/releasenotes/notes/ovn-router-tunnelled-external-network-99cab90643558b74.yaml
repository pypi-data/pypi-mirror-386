    OVN routers can be attached to tunnelled external gateway networks. The
    Logical Router is pinned to a gateway chassis, instead of the gateway
    Logical Router Port. The mechanism driver monitors the status of the
    gateway chassis to re-schedule the Logical Router in case of failure,
    providing high availability.
