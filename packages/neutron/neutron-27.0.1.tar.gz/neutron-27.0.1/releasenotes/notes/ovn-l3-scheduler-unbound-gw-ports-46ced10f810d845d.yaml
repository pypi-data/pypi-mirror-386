    The artifact of creating a gateway chassis called
    "neutron-ovn-invalid-chassis" when a "Logical_Router_Port" cannot be
    assigned to any chassis is removed. Now no gateway chassis is created and
    the "Logical_Router_Port" field will be empty.
upgrade:
  - |
    Any "Logical_Router_Port" with a gateway chassis named
    "neutron-ovn-invalid-chassis" will be updated and this chassis will be
    deleted. An unhosted (unbound) "Logical_Router_Port" will have no gateway
    assigned.
