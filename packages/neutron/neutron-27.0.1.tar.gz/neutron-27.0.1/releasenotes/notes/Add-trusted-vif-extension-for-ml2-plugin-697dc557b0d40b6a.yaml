features:
  - |
    New ML2 plugin extension ``port_trusted`` is now available. This extension
    implements the ``port_trusted_vif`` API extension which adds to the port resource
    a new boolean field called ``trusted``. This field should be used by admin users
    to set the port as trusted what was previously possible only through the port's
    ``binding:profile`` dictionary. Value of the ``trusted`` field is still visible
    in the port's ``binding:profile`` dictionary so that for example Nova still has
    it where it is expected to be.

deprecations:
  - |
    Setting ``trusted`` key directly in the port's ``binding:profile`` is
    deprecated and will be forbidden in future releases. Dedicated port's
    attribute ``trusted``, added by the API extension ``port_trusted_vif``
    should be used instead.
