deprecations:
  - |
    Config option ``allow_overlapping_ips`` is deprecated for removal now.
    Default value for that option is now changed to the ``True`` in the default
    IPAM module of Neutron, as the only reason it was defaulting to ``False``
    was to keep compatibility with Nova security group code that was removed
    already.  The config option itself will removed in the ``Z`` release.
