features:
  - |
    Since Epoxy (2025.1) release, the Neutron quota engine always checks
    the current resource usage before updating the quota limits. Only when the
    CLI "--force" parameter is passed, this check is skipped. That aligns the
    Neutron quota engine behaviour with other projects.
deprecations:
  - |
    The Neutron quota commands now always check the resource limits. The CLI
    parameter "--check-limits" is no longer needed, as this is the default
    behaviour.
