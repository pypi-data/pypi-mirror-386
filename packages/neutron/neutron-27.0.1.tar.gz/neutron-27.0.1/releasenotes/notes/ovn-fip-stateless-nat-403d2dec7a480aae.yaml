    The ML2/OVN driver can now use stateless NAT for floating IP addresses.
    This functionality is configurable using the new boolean config option
    ``[ovn]stateless_nat_enabled``. By default, this option is disabled,
    keeping the current behaviour. This functionality improves the performance
    in some deployments (DPDK based, for example) by avoiding hitting
    conntrack OVN actions.
