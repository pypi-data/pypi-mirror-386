    A new API resource ``address group`` and its CRUD operations are introduced
    to represent a group of IPv4 and IPv6 address blocks. A new option
    ``--remote-address-group`` is added to the ``security group rule create``
    command to allow network connectivity with a group of address blocks. And
    the backend support is added to the ``openvswitch`` firewall.  When IP
    addresses are updated in the address groups, changes will also be reflected
    in the firewall rules of the associated security group rules.
