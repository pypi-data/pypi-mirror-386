deprecations:
  - |
    The OVN Metadata agent is deprecated in favor of the `OVN agent
    <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/ovn/ovn_agent.html>`_. In order
    to replace the the first with the second one, it is only needed to stop
    the OVN Metadata agent and start the OVN agent with the "metadata"
    plugable extension enabled. The OVN agent allows plugable extensions, like
    for example "metadata", that can be enabled or disabled `via the
    configuration file
    <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/ovn/ovn_agent.html#plugable-extensions>`_.
    Apart from the ``[DEFAULT]extensions`` configuration parameter required
    in the OVN agent, the rest of the configuration is the same. Thus the new
    agent can use the old configuration files by just adding the the "metadata"
    plugable extension.
