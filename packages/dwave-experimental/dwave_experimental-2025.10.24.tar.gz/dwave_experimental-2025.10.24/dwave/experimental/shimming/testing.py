    """Replace the MockSampler by an MCMC sampler with sensitivity to flux_biases.

    We modify the DWaveMockSampler routine so that the sampling distribution is
    sensitive to flux_biases (linear fields are modified in proportion to
    flux_biases). Under a freeze-out approximation flux_bias offset can be interpretted
    as a scaled offset on the Ising model field h, the scale is set to match a typical
    single-qubit freezeout value. The classical sampler for the resulting Ising
    models is chosen as a form of simulated annealing to which is appropriate for
    basic tests of shimming functionality.

    The sampled distribution is not a function of most QPU parameters, if an unsupported
    parameter is used these will raise warnings. Warnings can be suppressed by use of the
    mocked_parameters class variable.

    flux_biases_baseline can be added as a list of length
    self.properties['num_qubits'] to model a static processor noise.
    By default a baseline of 1e-5 Phi0 is used,
    in this way a shimming routine can be seen to systematically correct for this
    baseline.

    See the shimming tutorial and dwave-experimental tests for examples of usage.
