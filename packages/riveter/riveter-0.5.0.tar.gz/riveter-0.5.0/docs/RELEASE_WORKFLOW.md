## Overview

The automated release workflow is implemented as a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- ‚úÖ Validates prerequisites and permissions
- üß™ Runs comprehensive tests across multiple platforms and Python versions
- üîí Performs security scans and quality checks
- üì¶ Builds and validates packages
- üöÄ Publishes to PyPI (production releases)
- üè∑Ô∏è Creates GitHub releases with assets
- üìã Updates changelog and version information

### Key Features

- **Manual Control**: Releases are triggered manually through GitHub UI
- **Semantic Versioning**: Supports patch, minor, and major version bumps
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test the workflow without publishing
- **Multi-Platform Testing**: Tests on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- **Security First**: Comprehensive security validation and secret management
- **Rollback Support**: Automatic rollback documentation for failed releases

## Triggering Releases

### Prerequisites

Before triggering a release, ensure:

1. **Branch**: You are on the `main` branch
2. **Permissions**: You have write access to the repository
3. **Tests**: All existing tests are passing
4. **Changelog**: CHANGELOG.md has unreleased changes (if applicable)
5. **Secrets**: Required secrets are configured (see [Secret Setup](#secret-setup-and-configuration))

### Step-by-Step Release Process

#### 1. Navigate to GitHub Actions

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the **Actions** tab
3. Find the **Release** workflow in the left sidebar

#### 2. Trigger the Workflow

1. Click **Run workflow** button (top right)
2. Configure the release parameters:

   **Version Type** (required):
   - `patch`: Bug fixes and minor updates (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
   - `minor`: New features, backward compatible (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
   - `major`: Breaking changes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)

   **Dry Run** (optional):
   - `false` (default): Full release with publishing
   - `true`: Test run without publishing to PyPI

3. Click **Run workflow**

#### 3. Monitor Progress

The workflow will show progress through these stages:

1. **Validate** - Prerequisites and permissions
2. **Test** - Multi-platform comprehensive testing
3. **Security-scan** - Security and quality checks
4. **Build-validation** - Package building and validation
5. **Version-management** - Version updates and tagging
6. **Changelog** - Changelog processing
7. **Build** - Final package building
8. **Publish-pypi** - PyPI publication (if not dry run)
9. **Github-release** - GitHub release creation
10. **Summary** - Final status report

### Release Parameters Explained

#### Version Type Selection Guide

| Version Type | When to Use | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **patch** | Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor improvements | 1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.2.4 |
| **minor** | New features, enhancements, backward-compatible changes | 1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.3.0 |
| **major** | Breaking changes, major refactoring, API changes | 1.2.3 ‚Üí 2.0.0 |

#### Dry Run Mode

Use dry run mode to:
- Test the release workflow without publishing
- Validate that all tests pass
- Check package building process
- Verify changelog processing
- Ensure secrets are properly configured

## Secret Setup and Configuration

### Required Secrets

The release workflow requires the following repository secrets:

#### 1. PYPI_API_TOKEN (Required for production releases)

**Purpose**: Authenticates with PyPI for package publishing

**Setup Instructions**:

1. **Generate PyPI API Token**:
   - Go to [PyPI Account Settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/)
   - Navigate to "API tokens" section
   - Click "Add API token"
   - Set scope to "Entire account" or specific to "riveter" project
   - Copy the generated token (starts with `pypi-`)

2. **Add to GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste the PyPI token
   - Click "Add secret"

**Security Notes**:
- Token should start with `pypi-` and be 200+ characters
- Use project-scoped tokens when possible
- Rotate tokens every 90 days
- Never share or commit tokens to code

#### 2. GITHUB_TOKEN (Automatically provided)

**Purpose**: Repository operations (tags, releases)

**Setup**: No action required - GitHub automatically provides this token with appropriate permissions.

### Secret Validation

The workflow automatically validates secrets:

```yaml
# Example validation output
üîê Secret Configuration Audit:
   PYPI_API_TOKEN: ‚úÖ Configured
   GITHUB_TOKEN: ‚úÖ Available
   Token format: ‚úÖ Valid
   Token length: ‚úÖ Sufficient
```

### Environment Configuration

For additional security, consider setting up environment protection rules:

1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Environments
2. Create environment named `pypi`
3. Add protection rules:
   - Required reviewers
   - Wait timer
   - Deployment branches (main only)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Releases can only be triggered from the main branch"

**Problem**: Workflow triggered from wrong branch

**Solution**:
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Then trigger workflow from GitHub UI
```

#### 2. "PYPI_API_TOKEN secret not found"

**Problem**: PyPI token not configured or incorrectly named

**Solutions**:
- Verify secret name is exactly `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
- Check secret is added to repository (not environment)
- Regenerate token if expired
- Use dry run mode to test without PyPI token

#### 3. "Tag v1.2.3 already exists"

**Problem**: Version tag already exists in repository

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check existing tags
git tag -l

# Delete tag locally and remotely (if needed)
git tag -d v1.2.3
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.2.3

# Or choose different version type
```

#### 4. "Package build failed"

**Problem**: Issues with package configuration or dependencies

**Solutions**:
- Check pyproject.toml syntax
- Verify all dependencies are properly specified
- Test build locally:
```bash
python -m build
twine check dist/*
```

#### 5. "PyPI publication failed"

**Problem**: Authentication or package issues

**Solutions**:
- Verify PyPI token permissions
- Check if package version already exists on PyPI
- Ensure package name matches PyPI project
- Review PyPI upload logs for specific errors

#### 6. "Tests failed on platform X"

**Problem**: Platform-specific test failures

**Solutions**:
- Review test logs for specific platform
- Check for platform-specific dependencies
- Verify file path handling (Windows vs Unix)
- Test locally on failing platform if possible

#### 7. "Security scan failed"

**Problem**: Security vulnerabilities detected

**Solutions**:
- Review Bandit security scan results
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Add security exceptions if false positives
- Check Safety vulnerability report

#### 8. "GitHub release creation failed"

**Problem**: GitHub API or permission issues

**Solutions**:
- Verify GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
- Check repository access settings
- Ensure tag was created successfully
- Review GitHub API rate limits

### Debugging Steps

#### 1. Check Workflow Logs
1. Go to Actions tab ‚Üí Failed workflow run
2. Click on failed job
3. Expand failed step
4. Review error messages and stack traces

#### 2. Validate Prerequisites Locally
```bash
# Check current version
grep -E '^version = ' pyproject.toml

# Verify tests pass
pytest tests/ -v

# Test package building
python -m build
twine check dist/*

# Check security
bandit -r src/
safety check
```

#### 3. Test with Dry Run
Always test with dry run first:
1. Set "Dry Run" to `true`
2. Monitor all stages except PyPI publication
3. Verify all validations pass
4. Then run production release

#### 4. Review Security Configuration
```bash
# Check repository secrets (via GitHub UI)
# Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

# Verify token format
# PyPI token should start with 'pypi-'
# Should be 200+ characters long
```

## Security Considerations

### Token Security

**Best Practices**:
- Use project-scoped PyPI tokens when possible
- Rotate tokens every 90 days
- Monitor token usage in PyPI account settings
- Never commit tokens to code or logs

**Token Validation**:
The workflow validates:
- Token format (starts with `pypi-`)
- Token length (200+ characters)
- Token scope and permissions
- Token expiration (if detectable)

### Workflow Security

**Access Control**:
- Only repository maintainers can trigger releases
- Releases restricted to `main` branch only
- Manual approval required (no automatic triggers)
- Comprehensive audit logging

**Environment Security**:
- Minimal required permissions
- Secure credential handling
- No credential exposure in logs
- Network isolation in GitHub Actions

### Supply Chain Security

**Package Integrity**:
- Comprehensive testing before release
- Security scanning with Bandit and Safety
- Package validation with twine check
- Checksum verification for dependencies

**Release Verification**:
- Multi-stage validation process
- Publication verification on PyPI
- Asset integrity checks
- Automated rollback documentation
