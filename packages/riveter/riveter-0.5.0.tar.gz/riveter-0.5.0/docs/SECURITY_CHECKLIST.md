# Security Checklist for Release Workflow

This checklist ensures all security measures are properly configured and maintained for the automated release workflow.

## Pre-Release Security Checklist

### Repository Configuration

- [ ] **Branch Protection Rules**
  - [ ] Main branch is protected
  - [ ] Require pull request reviews before merging
  - [ ] Require status checks to pass before merging
  - [ ] Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - [ ] Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
  - [ ] Require signed commits (recommended)

- [ ] **Repository Secrets**
  - [ ] `PYPI_API_TOKEN` is configured and valid
  - [ ] PyPI token is project-scoped (not account-wide)
  - [ ] PyPI token has minimal required permissions (upload only)
  - [ ] Token rotation schedule is documented and followed
  - [ ] No personal access tokens are used

- [ ] **Access Control**
  - [ ] Only maintainers can trigger release workflow
  - [ ] Repository collaborator permissions are reviewed
  - [ ] Two-factor authentication is enabled for all maintainers
  - [ ] Outside collaborators have minimal necessary access

### Workflow Security

- [ ] **Permissions Configuration**
  - [ ] Workflow uses minimal required permissions
  - [ ] `contents: write` for creating releases and tags
  - [ ] `id-token: write` for OIDC authentication
  - [ ] `actions: read` for workflow execution
  - [ ] No unnecessary permissions granted

- [ ] **Secret Handling**
  - [ ] Secrets are never logged or exposed in outputs
  - [ ] Environment variables are used for sensitive data
  - [ ] Credentials are cleared after use
  - [ ] No hardcoded secrets in workflow files

- [ ] **Input Validation**
  - [ ] Version type input is validated
  - [ ] Branch restrictions are enforced
  - [ ] User permissions are verified
  - [ ] Dry run mode is available for testing

## Release Execution Security Checklist

### Pre-Release Validation

- [ ] **Environment Checks**
  - [ ] Release triggered from main branch only
  - [ ] Triggering user has maintainer permissions
  - [ ] All required secrets are available
  - [ ] Token formats are validated

- [ ] **Security Scans**
  - [ ] Bandit security scan passes
  - [ ] Safety vulnerability check passes
  - [ ] Code quality checks pass
  - [ ] Dependency security audit passes

- [ ] **Build Validation**
  - [ ] Package builds successfully
  - [ ] Package integrity checks pass
  - [ ] Installation tests pass
  - [ ] No malicious code detected

### Publication Security

- [ ] **PyPI Publication**
  - [ ] Correct package name and version
  - [ ] Secure credential handling
  - [ ] Publication verification succeeds
  - [ ] Package availability confirmed

- [ ] **GitHub Release**
  - [ ] Release created with correct tag
  - [ ] Assets uploaded securely
  - [ ] Release notes generated properly
  - [ ] No sensitive information exposed

## Post-Release Security Checklist

### Verification

- [ ] **Package Verification**
  - [ ] Package available on PyPI
  - [ ] Package metadata is correct
  - [ ] Installation works as expected
  - [ ] No unauthorized modifications

- [ ] **Release Verification**
  - [ ] GitHub release created successfully
  - [ ] Assets are downloadable
  - [ ] Release notes are accurate
  - [ ] Tag points to correct commit

### Monitoring

- [ ] **Audit Trail**
  - [ ] Workflow execution logged
  - [ ] No failed authentication attempts
  - [ ] All operations completed successfully
  - [ ] Security alerts reviewed

- [ ] **Follow-up Actions**
  - [ ] Release announcement prepared
  - [ ] Documentation updated
  - [ ] Security incident response plan ready
  - [ ] Next release security review scheduled

## Security Incident Response

### Immediate Actions (if security issue detected)

1. **Stop Release Process**
   - [ ] Cancel running workflows
   - [ ] Prevent further releases
   - [ ] Assess scope of issue

2. **Secure Credentials**
   - [ ] Revoke compromised tokens
   - [ ] Generate new credentials
   - [ ] Update repository secrets
   - [ ] Notify team members

3. **Assess Impact**
   - [ ] Check recent releases for issues
   - [ ] Review audit logs
   - [ ] Identify affected systems
   - [ ] Document incident details

### Recovery Actions

1. **Fix Security Issue**
   - [ ] Address root cause
   - [ ] Update security controls
   - [ ] Test fixes thoroughly
   - [ ] Document changes

2. **Restore Operations**
   - [ ] Verify security measures
   - [ ] Test release workflow
   - [ ] Update documentation
   - [ ] Communicate resolution

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks

- [ ] Review workflow execution logs
- [ ] Check for security alerts
- [ ] Verify secret expiration dates
- [ ] Update security documentation

### Quarterly Tasks

- [ ] Rotate PyPI API tokens
- [ ] Review repository permissions
- [ ] Audit workflow security configuration
- [ ] Update security checklist

### Annual Tasks

- [ ] Comprehensive security review
- [ ] Update security policies
- [ ] Review incident response procedures
