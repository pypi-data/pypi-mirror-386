# Security Overview for Automated Release Workflow

This document provides an overview of the security measures implemented in the automated release workflow for the Riveter project.

## Security Architecture

The automated release workflow implements multiple layers of security to protect against unauthorized access, credential exposure, and malicious code injection.

### 1. Access Control

- **Branch Protection**: Releases can only be triggered from the `main` branch
- **User Validation**: Only repository maintainers can trigger release workflows
- **Manual Triggers**: Releases require explicit manual approval via GitHub UI
- **Permission Validation**: Workflow validates user permissions before proceeding

### 2. Credential Management

- **Repository Secrets**: All sensitive credentials stored as encrypted GitHub repository secrets
- **Minimal Scope**: PyPI tokens are project-scoped, not account-wide
- **Environment Variables**: Credentials passed via environment variables, not command line
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Sensitive variables cleared from environment after use
- **No Logging**: Credentials never logged or exposed in workflow outputs

### 3. Workflow Security

- **Minimal Permissions**: Workflow uses only required permissions (contents:write, id-token:write, actions:read)
- **Environment Protection**: PyPI publication uses protected environment
- **Input Validation**: All workflow inputs validated and sanitized
- **Dependency Pinning**: All workflow dependencies use specific versions
- **Security Scanning**: Comprehensive security scans before each release

### 4. Code Integrity

- **Multi-Platform Testing**: Tests run on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- **Multi-Python Testing**: Tests run on Python 3.12 and 3.13
- **Security Scans**: Bandit security analysis and Safety vulnerability checks
- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, and type checking
- **Package Validation**: Built packages validated before publication

## Security Features

### Pre-Release Security Validation

1. **Secret Availability Check**
   - Validates all required secrets are present
   - Checks token format and validity
   - Fails early if credentials are missing or invalid

2. **Automated Security Validation**
   - Runs comprehensive security configuration audit
   - Validates workflow permissions and secret usage
   - Checks for hardcoded secrets or insecure patterns

3. **Branch and Permission Validation**
   - Ensures release triggered from main branch only
   - Validates user has appropriate repository permissions
   - Confirms workflow has minimal required permissions

### Runtime Security Measures

1. **Secure Credential Handling**
   - Credentials passed via environment variables
   - No secrets in command line arguments
   - Automatic cleanup of sensitive environment variables
   - No credential exposure in logs or outputs

2. **Publication Security**
   - PyPI publication uses environment protection
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Publication verification and integrity checks
   - Secure asset upload to GitHub releases

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All operations logged in GitHub Actions
   - Security validation results recorded
   - Failed attempts and errors documented
   - No sensitive information in logs

### Post-Release Security

1. **Verification Checks**
   - Package availability verification on PyPI
   - GitHub release creation confirmation
   - Asset integrity validation
   - Release metadata verification

2. **Monitoring**
   - Workflow execution monitoring
   - Security alert integration
   - Audit log review capabilities
   - Incident response procedures

## Security Best Practices

### For Repository Maintainers

1. **Token Management**
   - Use project-scoped PyPI tokens only
   - Rotate tokens every 90 days
   - Never share or expose tokens
   - Use strong, unique passwords for PyPI account

2. **Access Control**
   - Enable two-factor authentication
   - Review repository permissions regularly
   - Use branch protection rules
   - Monitor repository access logs

3. **Release Process**
   - Always review changes before release
   - Use dry-run mode for testing
   - Monitor release workflow execution
   - Verify published packages

### For Contributors

1. **Code Security**
   - Never commit secrets or credentials
   - Use secure coding practices
   - Run security scans locally
   - Report security issues privately

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review dependency security advisories
   - Use minimal required dependencies
   - Verify dependency integrity

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring

- **Workflow Execution**: All release workflows logged and monitored
- **Security Scans**: Automated security scans on every release
- **Dependency Checks**: Vulnerability scanning of all dependencies
- **Access Monitoring**: Repository access and permission changes tracked

### Manual Reviews

- **Monthly**: Review workflow logs and security alerts
- **Quarterly**: Audit repository permissions and token rotation
- **Annually**: Comprehensive security review and policy updates

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Types

1. **Compromised Credentials**
   - Immediate token revocation
   - New credential generation
   - Audit of recent activities
   - Security review and remediation

2. **Unauthorized Release**
   - Release investigation and rollback if needed
   - Access review and permission audit
   - Security control strengthening
   - Incident documentation and lessons learned

3. **Malicious Code Injection**
   - Immediate workflow suspension
   - Code review and malware scanning
   - Clean environment restoration
   - Enhanced security measures implementation

### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Assess and contain the incident
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Suspend affected workflows
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and audit trails
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement security fixes
   - Restore secure operations
   - Update security measures
   - Communicate resolution

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct lessons learned review
   - Update security procedures
   - Enhance monitoring and detection
   - Provide security training if needed
