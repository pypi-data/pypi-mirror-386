Gana is an Algebraic Modeling Language (AML) for Multiscale Modeling and Optimization. 
Generated programs (```Prg```) can be subclasses of Multiparametric Mixed Integer Linear Programming (mpMILP). 

# Features 

Gana supports:

- mutable elements, allowing constraints/functions to be updated dynamically
- multiparametric as well as mixed integer programming
- formulation in both matrix form and set-based mathematical program 

Moreover, Gana uses a simple format to write constraints/functions. 

# Elements

Programs in Gana are written using element sets, namely:

1. ```I``` - index 
2. ```V``` - variable
3. ```P``` - parameter 
4. ```T``` - parametric variable
 

# Solvers

The list of natively supported solvers are:

1. [PPOPT](https://github.com/TAMUparametric/PPOPT) for multiparametric programming (mp)
2. [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) for Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)
Programs  can, however, be exported as a [.mps](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/22.1.2?topic=formats-working-mps-files) or [.lp](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/22.1.2?topic=formats-working-lp-files) file and passed to most solvers.


# Illustration

Gana is best run in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) as notebook (.ipynb) files, 
where programs can be visualized as canonical mathematical programs using set-notation.

Additionally, matrices can be exported. 

# Purpose

Gana was developed to enable certain functionalities in [energia (py)](https://energiapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Both were developed as PhD projects and have ample room for improvement. So please reach out to me on cacodcar@gmail.com with suggestions and such. 

<!-- 
or 

Matrices can be generated to represent: 

LHS Parameter coefficient of variables in constraints: 
    1. A - all
    2. G - inequality 
    3. H - equality
    4. NN - nonnegativity

RHS parameters in constraints:
    1. B 

RHS Parameter coefficient of parametric variables in constraints:
    1. F 

Bounds of the parametric variables:
    1. CRa - RHS coefficients
    2. CRb - Bound (upper or lower) -->
