```

# Usage example

```python
from harp.protocol import OperationMode
from harp.devices.currentdriver import CurrentDriver

# Example usage of the CurrentDriver device
with CurrentDriver("/dev/ttyUSB0") as device: # For Windows, use "COM8" or similar
    device.info()

    # Set the device to active mode
    device.set_mode(OperationMode.ACTIVE)

    # Get the events
    try:
        while True:
            for event in device.get_events():
                # Do what you need with the event
                print(event.payload)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        # Capture Ctrl+C to exit gracefully
        print("Exiting...")
    finally:
        # Do what you need to do to clean up. Disconnect is automatically called with the "with" statement.
        pass
