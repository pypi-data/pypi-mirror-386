            RESPONSE FORMAT:
            - Speak directly as your assigned role without any labels, prefixes, or announcements
            - Use plain text without markdown formatting (avoid **bold**, *italics*, # headers,

            - Do not add labels like "COUNTER:", "STATEMENT:", "OPENING:", etc. - just speak
              your argument
            - Focus on content, not formatting or structure

            You will be told your specific role and speaking context for each response.
