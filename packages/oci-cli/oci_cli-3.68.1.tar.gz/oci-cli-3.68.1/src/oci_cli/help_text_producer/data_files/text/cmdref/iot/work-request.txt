Description
===========

An asynchronous work request helps monitor long-running operations.
When you initiate a long-running operation, the service creates a work
request. This work request acts as an activity log, allowing you to
track each step of the operationâ€™s progress. Each work request has an
OCID, enabling programmatic interaction and automation.
