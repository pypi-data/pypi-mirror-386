## Future Vision: Capability Evolution

**See:** [dev-docs/vision/](dev-docs/vision/) for long-term capability vision.

**Note:** Vision documents describe **potential evolutionary directions** based on
founding vision and anticipated needs. These are **NOT committed features** - they
represent possible future development after current roadmap stabilizes.

**Current Priority:** v0.1.0 remains the focus. Future capabilities will be
evaluated after v0.1.0 based on user needs and adoption.

### Vision Highlights

The evolution explores potential capability waves beyond v0.1.0:

**Wave 1: Foundation** (Current)
- Status: In development (v0.1.0)
- Focus: Core functionality, essential features
- Delivery: [Target date]

**Wave 2: [Next Capability Theme]** (Post-v0.1.0 Vision)
- Status: Exploratory (not committed)
- Focus: [Brief description of next wave]
- Decision: After v0.1.0 stabilizes, based on:
  - User demand signals (issues, feedback, adoption)
  - Technical validation (architecture supports extensions)
  - Team capacity (resources available for next phase)

**Example Wave 2 Themes (Exploratory):**
- Tool chaining and composition
- External API integrations
- Data persistence and caching
- Advanced configuration
**See [dev-docs/vision/CAPABILITY_EVOLUTION.md](dev-docs/vision/CAPABILITY_EVOLUTION.md) for:**
- Detailed wave descriptions
- Decision criteria (go/no-go frameworks)
- Success metrics
- Technical sketches
- Quarterly review process

**Key Principle:** Build for today, design for tomorrow. Vision guides architectural
decisions *today* without committing to timelines *tomorrow*.

## Roadmap Philosophy

### Committed vs. Exploratory

| Type | Description | Location | Changes |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Committed** | Features with timelines | This document (ROADMAP.md) | Stable, changes = scope change |
| **Exploratory** | Potential future directions | [dev-docs/vision/](dev-docs/vision/) | Fluid, updated quarterly |
### Roadmap Updates

**Frequency:** Updated with each release and major milestone
**Process:**
1. Delivered features move to Release History
2. Next version features move to Current Focus
3. Planned features shift to Near-Term Roadmap
4. Exploratory features stay in vision documents until committed
### Feedback & Requests

**Feature Requests:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/liminalcommons/mcp-orchestration/issues)
**Discussions:** [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/liminalcommons/mcp-orchestration/discussions)

**Note:** All requests are considered, but inclusion in roadmap depends on:
- Alignment with project vision
- User demand and adoption
- Team capacity and resources
- Technical feasibility
