# MCP Orchestration — Solution-Neutral Specification

## 1) Purpose

Provide a single source of truth for Model Context Protocol (MCP) **client-facing configurations** and the **policies** that shape them, so heterogeneous MCP clients can reliably **discover, obtain, validate, and update** their server configuration in a controlled, auditable way.

## 2) Scope

* **In scope:** discovery of supported clients; retrieval of tailored configuration artifacts; update notification; change governance; validation; basic inventory and status reporting.
* **Out of scope:** secret issuance/rotation; identity provider functionality; client application lifecycle management; vendor-specific UI; launching downstream processes (unless explicitly added as an optional extension).

## 3) Stakeholders & Roles

* **Config Owners**: define policy/standards and approve releases.
* **Config Publishers**: author config templates and metadata.
* **Security/Compliance**: set constraints (e.g., redaction, allowed tools).
* **Client Operators/Users**: run MCP clients that consume configs.
* **Auditors**: review lineage, approvals, and deployment history.

## 4) Definitions

* **Client**: An application capable of consuming MCP configuration (e.g., editor, desktop agent).
* **Profile**: A context (e.g., dev/stage/prod, org/unit) that parameterizes configs.
* **Config Artifact**: A client-targeted, validated, immutable payload plus metadata.
* **Policy**: Declarative rules constraining or transforming configs (e.g., deny tool X).

## 5) Assumptions

* MCP clients can call generic request/response interfaces (e.g., JSON-RPC or REST).
* Configs are **consumer-specific** (per client family) and **contextual** (per profile).
* Secrets are provided by an external facility and **not** embedded in static artifacts.

## 6) Constraints

* Must operate without assuming any specific programming language, runtime, or datastore.
* Must not require clients to adopt a particular cryptographic library; only standard primitives.
* Must support disconnected (pull) and connected (stream/subscribe) update models.

## 7) Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Client & Profile Discovery

* **FR-1**: List supported client families and versions (e.g., `client_id`, supported schema versions).
* **FR-2**: List available profiles per client (e.g., `default`, `dev`, `prod`).
* **FR-3**: Expose compatibility notes (required keys, known limitations) as metadata.

### 7.2 Config Retrieval

* **FR-4**: Return a **fully materialized** Config Artifact for `(client_id, profile)` including:

  * `payload` (opaque to CCS; client-specific schema)
  * `schema_ref` (URI or version label)
  * `artifact_id` (stable content hash)
  * `version` (human-readable)
  * `issued_at` (timestamp)
  * `provenance` (who/what produced it)
  * `signature` (detached or enveloped, algorithm declared)
* **FR-5**: Support **parameter injection** via named inputs (e.g., `DATA_DIR`) without carrying sensitive values; clients supply values at apply time.

### 7.3 Validation & Policy

* **FR-6**: Validate payload against the client’s declared schema before release.
* **FR-7**: Apply organization policies (allow/deny lists, redactions, pinning) before signing.
* **FR-8**: Provide a machine-readable **validation report** with warnings/errors.

### 7.4 Update Semantics

* **FR-9**: Support idempotent **diff**/status checks using `artifact_id` or `payload_hash`.
* **FR-10**: Provide **subscription** (push) or **polling** (pull) for change notifications.
* **FR-11**: Include change metadata: changelog summary, publisher, policy set used.

### 7.5 Governance & Audit

* **FR-12**: Record immutable release entries with signer identity, approvers, and policy versions.
* **FR-13**: Expose read-only audit queries by time range, client, profile, or version.

### 7.6 Inventory & Health

* **FR-14**: Optionally accept client self-reports (current `artifact_id`, applied at, result).
* **FR-15**: Aggregate non-PII deployment counts by client/profile/version.

## 8) Non-Functional Requirements

### 8.1 Reliability & Availability

* **NFR-1**: Config retrieval must be eventually consistent; artifacts, once published, immutable.
* **NFR-2**: Target service availability ≥ 99.9% (config read path).

### 8.2 Performance

* **NFR-3**: Retrieval of an artifact ≤ 300 ms p95 under nominal load.
* **NFR-4**: Discovery calls ≤ 200 ms p95.

### 8.3 Security & Privacy

* **NFR-5**: No static secrets stored in artifacts. Inputs are referenced by name only.
* **NFR-6**: Artifacts must be **cryptographically signed**; verification instructions included.
* **NFR-7**: Access control on publish/read aligned with organizational policy (RBAC/ABAC).
* **NFR-8**: PII avoidance in telemetry; configurable retention windows.

### 8.4 Interoperability

* **NFR-9**: All APIs use open, documented schemas; no client-proprietary extensions required.
* **NFR-10**: Hash algorithms and signature schemes must be industry-standard and pluggable.

### 8.5 Operability

* **NFR-11**: Export structured logs, metrics, and traces; no mandated vendor.
* **NFR-12**: Support blue/green or canary release of artifacts at the metadata level.

## 9) Abstract Data Model (Logical)

**ClientFamily**

* `client_id`: string
* `schemas[]`: { `schema_ref`, `version_range` }
* `capabilities[]`: string
* `profiles[]`: string

**ConfigArtifact**

* `artifact_id`: string (content hash)
* `client_id`: string
* `profile`: string
* `payload`: opaque (JSON or other)
* `schema_ref`: string
* `version`: string
* `issued_at`: datetime
* `policy_set_id`: string
* `signature`: { `alg`, `value`, `key_id` }
* `provenance`: { `publisher_id`, `tooling_version` }
* `changelog`: string

**PolicySet**

* `policy_set_id`: string
* `rules[]`: declarative constraints (opaque to CCS core; evaluated by policy engine)

**ReleaseRecord**

* `artifact_id`, `status`, `approvals[]`, `audit_log_uri`

## 10) External Interfaces (Protocol-Agnostic)

> The following endpoints are expressed as abstract operations; they may be realized via JSON-RPC, REST, gRPC, etc.

* **ListClients() → [ClientFamily]**
* **ListProfiles(client_id) → [string]**
* **GetConfig(client_id, profile, inputs?) → ConfigArtifact**

  * `inputs` are **names only**; values are never persisted server-side.
* **DiffConfig(client_id, profile, current_artifact_id) → {status, latest_artifact_id, changelog?}**
* **SubscribeConfigUpdates(client_id, profile) → stream<UpdateEvent>**
  *Alternative: PollChanges(since_token) → [UpdateEvent]*
* **ValidateDraft(draft_payload, client_id, profile) → ValidationReport**
* **Publish(draft_payload, client_id, profile, policy_set_id, changelog) → ConfigArtifact**
* **GetAudit(query) → [ReleaseRecord]**
* **ReportClientState(client_fingerprint, client_id, profile, artifact_id, result) → Ack**

## 11) Client Interaction Model

### Pull (baseline)

1. Client discovers supported `(client_id, profiles)`.
2. Client calls `GetConfig(...)`.
3. Client **verifies signature** and **validates** locally against `schema_ref`.
4. Client applies config and persists `artifact_id`.
5. Client periodically calls `DiffConfig(...)`.

### Push (enhanced)

1. Client subscribes via `SubscribeConfigUpdates`.
2. On event, client fetches latest and repeats steps 3–4.

## 12) Policy Model (Declarative)

* **Inputs:** client identity claims, profile, environment tags, time/window, rule versions.
* **Actions:** allow/deny specific MCP tools, pin versions, redact keys, enforce required fields, set safe defaults.
* **Evaluation:** deterministic; policy set version is recorded in the artifact.

## 13) Security Considerations

* **Artifact Integrity:** Strong hash (e.g., SHA-256+) and digital signature (e.g., Ed25519 or equivalent).
* **AuthZ:** Separate roles for publishing, approving, and retrieving; least privilege.
* **Key Management:** Rotatable signing keys; key IDs and rotation policy documented.
* **Supply-Chain:** Record provenance (who built, what inputs, policy versions).
* **Privacy:** Telemetry must exclude user-identifying content by default.

## 14) Operational Scenarios (Use Cases)

* **UC-1 Bootstrap:** A new client family is added with schema and profile list; publishers can validate and publish first artifacts.
* **UC-2 Routine Update:** A config change is validated, approved, published, and rolled out via canary (subset profile or cohort).
* **UC-3 Emergency Revert:** Re-issue prior `artifact_id` as latest with a revert changelog; clients detect and roll back.
* **UC-4 Policy Tightening:** A new policy set removes a tool from prod; validation ensures references are stripped before signing.
* **UC-5 Air-gapped Consumption:** Clients use polling on a mirrored read-only endpoint; signatures verify offline.

## 15) Versioning & Backward Compatibility

* **Semantic Versioning** for artifacts and schemas.
* Clients must be able to **reject** incompatible schema versions and request a compatible artifact.
* Deprecation windows documented; CCS maintains at least N previous schema versions per client.

## 16) Telemetry & Observability (Optional but Recommended)

* Metrics: artifact fetch count, latency p50/p95, subscription fan-out, validation failure rates.
* Logs: publish actions, approvals, policy evaluation decisions, client state reports (non-PII).
* Traces: end-to-end publish → fetch path for debugging.

## 17) Deployment & Topology (Agnostic)

* The service may be provided as:

  * **Centralized** multi-tenant endpoint.
  * **Per-org** instance.
  * **Embedded** sidecar inside an existing control plane.
* Must support **read replicas** for high-volume retrievals.
* Storage and message transport are not prescribed.

## 18) Acceptance Criteria (Minimum)

* AC-1: For at least one client family and one profile, `GetConfig` returns a signed, schema-valid artifact.
* AC-2: `DiffConfig` correctly reports “up-to-date” vs “outdated”.
* AC-3: Publishing enforces policy and records an immutable audit entry.
* AC-4: Signature verification instructions enable a client to detect tampering.
* AC-5: Documentation includes schema references, policy model, and operator runbook.

## 19) Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk:** Config embeds sensitive data.
  **Mitigation:** Use input references; never persist values; externalize secret resolution.
* **Risk:** Client fragmentation.
  **Mitigation:** Per-client schemas + compatibility notes; contract tests per client family.
* **Risk:** Rollout breaks editors at scale.
  **Mitigation:** Canary cohorts, quick revert via previous `artifact_id`.

## 20) Future Extensions (Non-binding)

* Client-side hot-reload hints; cohort targeting; multi-sig approvals; diff-as-patch delivery; SBOM-like manifest for config dependencies.
