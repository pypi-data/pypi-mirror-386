**Current Status:** Wave 1 (Foundation) - Delivering core config orchestration

**Decision Cadence:** Review quarterly after milestone completion

---

## Wave 1: Foundation (Current)

### Status

**Current:** In Active Development
**Target:** v0.1.0 (MVP)
**Timeline:** Current sprint/milestone

### Capability Theme

Establish core configuration orchestration that delivers immediate value:

- **Client Discovery** - List supported MCP client families and profiles (FR-1, FR-2)
- **Config Retrieval** - Return signed, validated config artifacts (FR-4)
- **Schema Validation** - Validate payloads against client schemas (FR-6)
- **Immutable Artifacts** - Content-addressable storage with cryptographic hashing
- **Basic Diff/Status** - Idempotent change detection (FR-9)

### Motivation

Why Wave 1 matters:

1. **User Need:** MCP clients need a reliable way to discover and obtain validated configurations without manual file management
2. **Market Signal:** Validate that centralized config distribution solves real pain points before expanding to policy/governance
3. **Technical Foundation:** Establish artifact model, signing infrastructure, and client protocol patterns
4. **Learning Opportunity:** Gather feedback on schema design, client integration patterns, and update cadence

### Technical Sketch

**Architecture Principles:**
- Keep it simple (YAGNI - defer policy engine to Wave 2)
- Extensible design (artifact metadata supports future policy fields)
- Clear abstractions (separate retrieval from evaluation)

**Example: Artifact Structure (Wave 1)**
```python
# Wave 1: Simple signed artifacts
@dataclass
class ConfigArtifact:
    artifact_id: str  # SHA-256 content hash
    client_id: str
    profile: str
    payload: dict  # Opaque to service
    schema_ref: str
    version: str
    issued_at: datetime
    signature: Signature  # Ed25519 detached signature
    provenance: dict  # Publisher metadata

    # Extension points for Wave 2 (policy)
    # Reserved fields: policy_set_id, approvals[], changelog
```

**API Operations (Wave 1 Subset):**
```python
# Core operations
async def list_clients() -> List[ClientFamily]:
    """FR-1: Discover supported clients"""

async def get_config(client_id: str, profile: str) -> ConfigArtifact:
    """FR-4: Retrieve validated, signed artifact"""

async def diff_config(client_id: str, profile: str,
                     current_artifact_id: str) -> DiffResult:
    """FR-9: Check for updates"""

# Deferred to Wave 2: publish, validate_draft, subscribe_updates
```

### Success Metrics

How we'll know Wave 1 succeeded:

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Client Adoption** | 3+ client types integrated | Event logs |
| **Config Retrieval Success** | >99% p95 <300ms | Latency metrics (NFR-3) |
| **Signature Verification** | 100% artifacts verifiable | Validation tests |
| **Update Detection** | <1min staleness | Diff call frequency |
| **Developer Onboarding** | <30min to first config | User feedback |

### Decision: Committed

**Status:** ✅ Committed to current roadmap
**Rationale:** Core functionality required for MCP config distribution to exist
**Timeline:** Current sprint → v0.1.0 release

**Acceptance Criteria (AC-1, AC-2, AC-4):**
- [x] One client family + profile returns signed artifact
- [x] Diff correctly reports up-to-date vs outdated
- [x] Signature verification instructions provided

---

## Wave 2: Governance (Post-v1.0, Exploratory)

### Status

**Current:** Exploratory (Not Committed)
**Target:** v1.0.0 (TBD)
**Review Date:** Quarterly review after v0.1.0 ships

### Capability Theme

Add policy enforcement, approval workflows, and audit:

- **Policy Engine** - Declarative rules (allow/deny tools, redactions, pinning) (FR-7)
- **Approval Workflows** - Multi-signer governance before release
- **Audit Logging** - Immutable release records with lineage (FR-12, FR-13)
- **Canary Rollouts** - Gradual deployment via cohort profiles (NFR-12)
- **Subscription Updates** - Push notifications for config changes (FR-10)

### Motivation

**User Story:**
> "As a security admin, I need to enforce that prod clients never enable experimental MCP tools, and I need an audit trail proving compliance."

**Why Defer to Wave 2:**
- Wave 1 validates core distribution works before adding governance complexity
- Policy DSL design benefits from real-world config patterns learned in Wave 1
- Approval workflows require org integration (RBAC, SSO) not needed for MVP

### Exploratory Design

**Policy Model (Declarative):**
```yaml
# Example policy set for Wave 2
policy_set_id: "org-prod-v3"
rules:
  - type: deny_tool
    tool_name: "experimental_*"
    profiles: ["prod"]
  - type: redact_keys
    keys: ["debug_flags", "internal_endpoints"]
  - type: pin_version
    server: "mcp-database"
    version: "~>1.2.0"
```

**API Extensions:**
```python
# New operations in Wave 2
async def validate_draft(payload: dict, client_id: str,
                        profile: str, policy_set_id: str) -> ValidationReport:
    """FR-8: Pre-publish validation with policy"""

async def publish(draft_payload: dict, client_id: str, profile: str,
                 policy_set_id: str, changelog: str) -> ConfigArtifact:
    """Apply policy, request approvals, sign and release (FR-6, FR-7, AC-3)"""
```

### Decision Framework

**Defer to Wave 2 IF:**
- [ ] 5+ organizations using Wave 1 for 3+ months
- [ ] User requests for policy enforcement (collect via feedback)
- [ ] Compliance requirements surface (e.g., SOC2, audits)

**Advance to Wave 2 IF:**
- Proven config distribution model (Wave 1 stable)
- Clear policy patterns emerge from user configs
- Team bandwidth for RBAC/approval integration

---

## Wave 3: Intelligence (Post-v2.0, Exploratory)

### Status

**Current:** Speculative (Far Future)
**Target:** v2.0.0+ (Multi-year horizon)
**Review Date:** Annual review after v1.0 adoption proves value

### Capability Theme

Add AI-powered validation, analytics, and anomaly detection:

- **Smart Validation** - LLM-assisted schema compliance and best practice checks
- **Config Analytics** - Insights into tool usage patterns, version drift, update lag
- **Anomaly Detection** - Flag suspicious config changes or risky tool combinations
- **Auto-Remediation** - Suggest fixes for validation failures or policy violations
- **Predictive Rollout** - ML-based canary cohort sizing and rollback predictions

### Motivation (Speculative)

**User Story:**
> "As a config publisher, I want AI to warn me that enabling tool X with tool Y has historically caused crashes, and suggest safer alternatives."

**Why Highly Exploratory:**
- Requires substantial Wave 1/2 telemetry data to train models
- LLM integration adds complexity (latency, cost, accuracy)
- User trust in AI recommendations must be earned gradually

### Design Constraints

**If ever pursued:**
- Must preserve human-in-loop for final approval (no auto-publish)
- Privacy-first: No client PII in training data (NFR-8)
- Explainability: AI must show reasoning, not black-box decisions

### Decision Trigger

**Do NOT pursue until:**
- [ ] 1000+ artifacts published across 100+ orgs (data scale)
- [ ] User demand for "smart suggestions" surfaces organically
- [ ] Wave 2 governance proves reliable (don't skip to AI)

---

## Wave 4: Ecosystem (Post-v3.0, Exploratory)

### Status

**Current:** Visionary (No concrete timeline)
**Target:** v3.0.0+ (Multi-year, market-dependent)

### Capability Theme

Transform from service to platform:

- **Multi-Tenant SaaS** - Hosted offering for small teams (currently self-hosted)
- **Config Marketplace** - Share/discover community configs (like Docker Hub for MCP)
- **Federation** - Cross-org config sharing with trust boundaries
- **Plugin Ecosystem** - Third-party policy engines, validation tools, analytics
- **Client SDK Generator** - Auto-generate type-safe clients for any language

### Motivation (Highly Speculative)

**User Story:**
> "As a new MCP user, I want to browse pre-validated config templates for popular tools, with community ratings and security audits."

**Why Defer Indefinitely:**
- Requires Wave 1-3 to prove sustained market need
- SaaS/marketplace = major business model shift (not just tech)
- Federation introduces complex trust/security challenges

### Decision Framework

**Only consider IF:**
- [ ] Self-hosted deployments reach 500+ organizations
- [ ] Community actively requests config sharing (not just hypothetical)
- [ ] Competitive pressure from similar marketplace offerings
- [ ] Business model validated (pricing, support, SLA commitments)

---

## Architectural Guidance for AI Agents

### Today's Design Decisions (Wave 1)

**DO:**
- ✅ Design artifact metadata to be **extensible** (add fields in Wave 2 without breaking clients)
- ✅ Use **content-addressable storage** (artifact_id = hash; enables immutability for Wave 2 audit)
- ✅ Keep payload **opaque** (don't parse client configs; enables schema evolution)
- ✅ Build **pluggable signature verification** (algorithm field allows future crypto upgrades)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Implement policy evaluation engine yet (Wave 2 complexity; learn patterns first)
- ❌ Build approval workflows (Wave 2; requires org RBAC integration)
- ❌ Add AI/ML features (Wave 3; no training data exists yet)
- ❌ Design for multi-tenancy (Wave 4; adds auth/billing complexity)

### Extension Points (Prepare, Don't Build)

```python
# Wave 1: Include reserved fields in artifact model
class ConfigArtifact:
    # ... Wave 1 fields ...

    # Reserved for Wave 2 (null in Wave 1)
    policy_set_id: Optional[str] = None  # Enable policy evolution
    approvals: Optional[List[Approval]] = None  # Future governance
    changelog: Optional[str] = None  # Human-readable change summary
```

### Refactoring Triggers

**When to refactor for next wave:**
- **Wave 1 → Wave 2:** If >50% of configs need manual policy checks (proves need for automation)
- **Wave 2 → Wave 3:** If validation failures correlate with patterns (ML opportunity)
- **Any Wave → Wave 4:** If self-hosting becomes primary blocker to adoption (SaaS signal)

---

## Review Schedule

**Quarterly Decision Points:**
1. Review Wave 1 success metrics (adoption, latency, errors)
2. Collect user feedback on governance pain points (Wave 2 signals)
3. Assess team bandwidth and prioritize based on evidence

**Do NOT advance waves based on:**
- Feature parity with competitors (build for users, not roadmaps)
- Technology hype (AI, blockchain, etc.)
- Premature optimization (solve problems that exist, not hypothetical ones)

---

## Summary: Current Focus

**Wave 1 Deliverables (v0.1.0):**
- [ ] Client discovery API (ListClients, ListProfiles)
- [ ] Config retrieval with signature verification (GetConfig)
- [ ] Diff/status checking (DiffConfig)
- [ ] Schema validation (pre-publish)
- [ ] Immutable artifact storage (content-addressable)
- [ ] Developer documentation + quickstart

**Explicitly Deferred:**
- Policy engine → Wave 2 (learn config patterns first)
- Audit logging → Wave 2 (governance not critical for MVP)
- AI validation → Wave 3 (no training data yet)
- Marketplace → Wave 4 (far future speculation)

**Next Review:** After v0.1.0 ships + 3 months of user feedback
