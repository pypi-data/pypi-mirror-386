## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (check with `python --version`)
- **Git** for version control
- **Just** task runner (optional but recommended)

### First-Time Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

```bash
# Fork on GitHub first, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-orchestration.git
cd mcp-orchestration

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/liminalcommons/mcp-orchestration.git
```

2. **Create virtual environment:**

```bash
# Using our automated script (recommended)
./scripts/venv-create.sh

# Or manually
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
# Install with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

4. **Verify installation:**

```bash
# Check environment and discover commands
just check-env  # Validate environment
just --list     # Show all available commands

# Run smoke tests
just smoke      # Quick validation

# Run full test suite
just test
```

**Note:** `setup.sh` installs `just` automatically. Commands map to:
- `just test` → `pytest`
- `just smoke` → `./scripts/smoke-test.sh`
- `just check-env` → `./scripts/check-env.sh`

5. **Configure environment:**

```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
# CODA_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Troubleshooting:** If you encounter issues, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We follow a simplified Git workflow:

- **`main`** - Production-ready code, protected branch
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features (if used)
- **`feature/xyz`** - New features or enhancements
- **`bugfix/xyz`** - Bug fixes
- **`hotfix/xyz`** - Urgent production fixes
- **`release/vX.Y.Z`** - Release preparation

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-backend-xyz

# Make changes, commit, push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add XYZ backend integration"
git push origin feature/add-backend-xyz
```

### Commit Message Format

We follow a conventional commit style with Claude Code attribution:

```

### Keeping Your Branch Updated

```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch on main
git rebase upstream/main

# If conflicts occur, resolve them, then:
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Force push to your fork (only for your feature branches!)
git push origin feature/xyz --force-with-lease
```

## Code Style Guide

We enforce code style automatically with pre-commit hooks. Follow these guidelines:

### Python Style

- **PEP 8** compliance (enforced by ruff)
- **Type hints** on all functions (enforced by mypy --strict)
- **Docstrings** on public classes and functions
- **Line length:** 88 characters (black default)
- **Imports:** Sorted and organized (isort via ruff)

**Example:**

```python
from typing import Any

def process_tool_call(
    tool_name: str,
    arguments: dict[str, Any],
    trace_id: str | None = None,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Process a tool call and return the result.

    Args:
        tool_name: Namespaced tool name (e.g., "chora:generate_content")
        arguments: Tool arguments as key-value pairs
        trace_id: Optional trace ID for correlation

    Returns:
        Tool execution result

    Raises:
        ValueError: If tool_name format is invalid
        BackendError: If backend execution fails
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### Code Organization

- **One class per file** (for major classes)
- **Group related functions** in modules
- **Avoid deep nesting** (max 3-4 levels)
- **Use descriptive names** (readability over brevity)

### Configuration

- **Use pydantic** for configuration models
- **Environment variables** for secrets
- **Type-safe** config access

### Error Handling


```python
# Good: Specific exceptions
try:
    result = backend.call_tool(tool_name, args)
except BackendNotFoundError as e:
    logger.error(f"Backend not found: {e}")
    raise
except BackendTimeoutError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Backend timeout, retrying: {e}")
    # Retry logic...

# Bad: Bare except
try:
    result = backend.call_tool(tool_name, args)
except:  # ❌ Too broad
    pass
```


### Logging

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Use structured logging
logger.info("Tool call started", extra={
    "tool_name": tool_name,
    "trace_id": trace_id,
})

# Avoid f-strings in log messages (use % formatting)
logger.debug("Received %d arguments", len(arguments))
```

---

## Testing Requirements

All code changes must include tests and pass existing tests.

### Test Coverage

- **Minimum coverage:** 85% (enforced)
- **All new functions** must have tests
- **Bug fixes** must include regression tests

### Running Tests

```bash
# Quick smoke tests (<30 seconds)
just smoke

# Full test suite with coverage
just test           # Runs pytest with coverage, fails if <85%

# Detailed coverage report (HTML)
just test-coverage  # Opens in browser
```

**Without `just`:**
- `just smoke` → `./scripts/smoke-test.sh`
- `just test` → `pytest --cov=src/mcp_orchestration --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=85`
- `just test-coverage` → `pytest --cov... --cov-report=html && open htmlcov/index.html`

### Writing Tests

Tests go in `tests/` directory, mirroring `src/` structure:

```
src/mcp_orchestration/
  backends/
    registry.py
tests/
  test_registry.py     # Unit tests
  smoke/
    test_routing.py    # Smoke tests
```

**Example test:**

```python
import pytest
from mcp_orchestration.backends.registry import BackendRegistry

def test_registry_add_backend():
    """Test adding a backend to registry."""
    registry = BackendRegistry()
    backend = MockBackend(name="test", namespace="test")

    registry.add(backend)

    assert "test" in registry.list_backends()
    assert registry.get("test") == backend

def test_registry_duplicate_namespace():
    """Test that duplicate namespaces raise ValueError."""
    registry = BackendRegistry()
    backend1 = MockBackend(name="test1", namespace="same")
    backend2 = MockBackend(name="test2", namespace="same")

    registry.add(backend1)

    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="namespace.*already exists"):
        registry.add(backend2)
```

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests are fast validation tests using mocks:

```python
# tests/smoke/test_new_feature.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock

@pytest.fixture
def mock_backend():
    backend = MagicMock()
    backend.name = "test"
    backend.namespace = "test"
    backend.call_tool = AsyncMock(return_value={"success": True})
    return backend

async def test_feature_works(mock_backend):
    """Smoke test: feature basic functionality."""
    result = await mock_backend.call_tool("test:tool", {})
    assert result["success"] is True
```

## Architecture Overview

For detailed architecture information, see:

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - P5 Gateway pattern implementation
- **[DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Developer deep dive (Phase 4)
- **[GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - User-focused setup guide

### Key Concepts

**Pattern P5 (Gateway & Aggregator):**
- Single MCP server aggregating multiple backends
- Tool namespacing for routing (e.g., `projecta:*`, `projectb:*`)
- Subprocess-based backend execution

**Backend System:**
- `BackendRegistry` - Manages backend lifecycle
- `BaseBackend` - Abstract backend interface
- Backend implementations in `src/mcp_orchestration/backends/`

**Configuration:**
- Pydantic models in `src/mcp_orchestration/config.py`
- Environment variables via `.env`
- Backend-specific config sections

---

- Use `just prepare-release patch` for automated releases

**For contributors:**
- Focus on features and bug fixes
- Maintainers handle version bumps and releases
- Check [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for latest changes
