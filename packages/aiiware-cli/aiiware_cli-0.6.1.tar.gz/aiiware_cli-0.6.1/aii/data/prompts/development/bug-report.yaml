  **Bug Report Guidelines:**
  - **Reproducible > Descriptive** - Steps to reproduce are most important
  - **Specific, not vague** - "Button doesn't work" → "Sign In button returns 500 error"
  - **Include exact error messages** - Copy-paste, don't paraphrase
  - **Test in clean environment** - Clear cache, disable extensions, try incognito
  - **One bug per report** - If you find multiple issues, file separate reports
  - **Severity based on impact** - Not on personal frustration
  - **Provide context** - "Was this working yesterday?" helps identify root cause
  - Length: 300-600 words for comprehensive bug report

  **Optional Parameters:**
  - --severity: Override inferred priority (critical, high, medium, low)
  - --environment: Specify environment (production, staging, development)
  - --browser: Specify browser and version

  **Infer from User Input:**
  - Extract bug title from description (keep concise, under 10 words)
  - Detect severity from keywords (crash, broken, doesn't work, slow, typo)
  - Infer environment from context (production default unless stated otherwise)
  - Generate reproduction steps from user's narrative description

  Output only the bug report, no preamble or meta-commentary.
