  - **Outbound:** [What this component calls - e.g., "Auth Service gRPC API", "PostgreSQL queries"]

  **Dependencies:**
  - **Hard Dependencies:** [Cannot function without - e.g., "PostgreSQL database", "Auth service"]
  - **Soft Dependencies:** [Degrades gracefully - e.g., "Analytics service", "Email notifications"]

  **Scaling Strategy:**
  - **Horizontal:** [How it scales - e.g., "Auto-scales 2-20 instances based on CPU"]
  - **Vertical:** [Resource limits - e.g., "4 vCPU, 8GB RAM per instance"]

  **Primary User Flow:** [Step-by-step data movement through the system]

  1. **User Action:** [e.g., "User submits login form"]
     - **Input:** [What data enters - e.g., "email, password"]
     - **Processing:** [What happens - e.g., "API Gateway validates format, forwards to Auth Service"]
     - **Output:** [What's returned - e.g., "JWT token + user profile"]

  2. **Service Interaction:** [How services communicate]
     - **Protocol:** [REST, gRPC, GraphQL, message queue]
     - **Data Format:** [JSON, Protocol Buffers, XML]
     - **Error Handling:** [Retry logic, circuit breakers, fallbacks]

  3. **Data Persistence:** [How data is stored]
     - **Write Path:** [e.g., "User data → PostgreSQL via connection pool"]
     - **Read Path:** [e.g., "Redis cache check → PostgreSQL fallback"]
     - **Consistency:** [Strong / Eventual - explain trade-offs]

  **Critical Paths:** [Latency-sensitive flows that require special attention]

  ## 🎯 Design Decisions

  Document 4-6 key architectural choices:

  ### Decision 1: [e.g., "Microservices vs Monolith"]

  **Choice Made:** [What was decided - e.g., "Microservices architecture"]

  **Rationale:**
  - [Reason 1 - e.g., "Independent scaling of high-traffic services"]
  - [Reason 2 - e.g., "Team autonomy and faster iteration"]
  - [Reason 3 - e.g., "Technology diversity (Node.js for API, Go for data processing)"]

  **Alternatives Considered:**
  - [Alternative 1 - e.g., "Monolith: Rejected due to scaling bottlenecks"]
  - [Alternative 2 - e.g., "Serverless: Not chosen due to cold start latency"]

  **Trade-offs Accepted:**
  - ✅ **Pros:** [Benefit 1, Benefit 2]
  - ❌ **Cons:** [Downside 1 - e.g., "Increased operational complexity", Downside 2 - e.g., "Network overhead"]

  ---

  ### Decision 2: [e.g., "Database Choice: PostgreSQL"]

  **Choice Made:** [What was decided]

  **Rationale:** [Why this choice]

  **Alternatives Considered:** [What else was evaluated]

  **Trade-offs Accepted:** [Pros and cons]

  - **Throughput:** [e.g., "10K requests/second peak"]
  - **Storage:** [e.g., "2TB database, growing 50GB/month"]

  **Scaling Strategy:**

  **Horizontal Scaling:**
  - [Which components scale horizontally - e.g., "API Gateway, Web Servers (stateless)"]
  - [Auto-scaling triggers - e.g., "CPU >70% for 5 min → add instance"]

  **Vertical Scaling:**
  - [Which components scale vertically - e.g., "Database (16 → 32 vCPU)"]

  **Bottlenecks Identified:**
  1. [Bottleneck 1 - e.g., "Database writes during peak traffic"]
     - **Solution:** [e.g., "Write-through cache, read replicas"]
  2. [Bottleneck 2 - e.g., "Auth service single point of failure"]
     - **Solution:** [e.g., "Multi-region deployment with failover"]

  **Future Scaling Path:**
  - **6 months:** [Expected growth and mitigation - e.g., "1M users → add 2 DB read replicas"]
  - **12 months:** [Long-term plan - e.g., "10M users → migrate to sharded database"]
