  **Writing Guidelines:**
  - **Conversational, personal tone** - Write like emailing a friend, not broadcasting to masses
  - **Scannable structure** - Short paragraphs, bullet points, clear headers
  - **Value-first** - Every section should give readers something useful
  - **One main CTA** - Don't overwhelm with multiple competing asks
  - **Mobile-optimized** - 60%+ of emails are read on mobile, keep it tight
  - **Link generously** - Every claim, tool, or resource should have a link
  - **Emojis sparingly** - 1-2 per section max (in headers or bullet points)
  - **Personalization hooks** - Use "you" language, reference subscriber context
  - Length: 300-600 words total (readers are busy)

  **Tone Adaptation:**
  - **B2B/Professional:** Data-driven, authoritative, solution-focused
  - **B2C/Lifestyle:** Warm, relatable, story-driven
  - **Tech/Developer:** Direct, technical accuracy, no fluff
  - **Educational:** Patient, example-rich, step-by-step

  **Optional Parameters:**
  - --topic: Explicitly set newsletter theme (e.g., "AI developments this month")
  - --audience: Target subscriber (e.g., "SaaS founders", "email marketers", "developers")
  - --tone: Writing style (professional, casual, educational, inspirational)
  - --length: Target word count (short: 200-300, medium: 400-600, long: 700-1000)

  **Infer from User Input:**
  - Extract topic from natural language (e.g., "write newsletter about new product launch" ‚Üí topic is "product launch")
  - Detect tone based on topic (e.g., "technical update" ‚Üí professional tone)
  - Adjust structure based on content type (news = more sections, tutorial = fewer but deeper)
