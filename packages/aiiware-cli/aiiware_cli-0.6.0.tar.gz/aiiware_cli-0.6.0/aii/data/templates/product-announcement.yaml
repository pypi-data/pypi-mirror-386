  Generate a professional product announcement with the following structure:

  Product: {{product}}
  {{#if version}}Version: {{version}}{{/if}}
  {{#if date}}Release Date: {{date}}{{/if}}

  Required sections:
  1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences introducing the product and its value proposition)
  2. Key Features and Benefits
     {{#if key_features}}Focus specifically on: {{key_features}}{{/if}}
  3. Customer Impact (how this helps users, what problems it solves)
  4. Availability and Next Steps (where to get it, how to learn more)

  Writing guidelines:
  - Tone: Professional, exciting but not overhyped
  - Length: 300-400 words
  - Focus on value and benefits, not just features
  - Use active voice and clear language
  - Include a compelling call to action

  Output only the announcement content, no preamble or meta-commentary.
