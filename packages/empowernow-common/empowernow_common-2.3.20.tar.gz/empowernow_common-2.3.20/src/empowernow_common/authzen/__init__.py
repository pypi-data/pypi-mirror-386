üéØ EmpowerNow AuthZEN Package

Beautiful, intuitive authorization models with zero learning curve.
Enhanced with Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) capabilities.

Examples:
    # Natural language aliases
    who = Subject.user("alice")  # or Who.user("alice")
    what = Resource.file("/docs/secret.pdf")  # or What.file(...)
    how = Action.read()  # or How.read()
    when = Context(ip_address="192.168.1.1")  # or When(...)

    # Enhanced PDP with PEP capabilities
    async with EnhancedPDP("https://pdp.example.com", "client", "secret", "token_url") as pdp:
        result = await pdp.check(who, how, what, **when)

        if result.decision:
            print(f"Access granted with {len(result.constraints)} constraints")
            print(f"Processing {len(result.obligations)} obligations")
