To work with routes (and route profiles), enable the option Multi-Step Routes
in the Inventory Settings.

To create your route profiles, go to Inventory \> Configuration \> Settings
\> Warehouse Management -> Routes Profiles. There you can create the profiles
that suit your needs.

To apply your route profiles, go to the Inventory tab of the product form.
There you can select

* A Route Profile. This is the default profile for all companies in which the
  product is used.
* A Priority Route Profile. This is a profile that takes precedence over the
  default profile, but only for the current company.
