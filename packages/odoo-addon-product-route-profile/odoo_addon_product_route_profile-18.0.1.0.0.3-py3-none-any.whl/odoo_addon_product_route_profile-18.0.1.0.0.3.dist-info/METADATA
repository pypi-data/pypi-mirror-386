This module replaces the initial concept of route_ids with a new concept
of "route profile", coming with a company-specific and priority route
profile.

Configuration
=============

To work with routes (and route profiles), enable the option Multi-Step
Routes in the Inventory Settings.

To create your route profiles, go to Inventory > Configuration >
Settings > Warehouse Management -> Routes Profiles. There you can create
the profiles that suit your needs.

To apply your route profiles, go to the Inventory tab of the product
form. There you can select

- A Route Profile. This is the default profile for all companies in
  which the product is used.
- A Priority Route Profile. This is a profile that takes precedence over
  the default profile, but only for the current company.
