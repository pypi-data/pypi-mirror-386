"""The lisainstrument.noisy package provides noise definitions and noise generation tools

The definition and generation of noise is separated. The modules noise_defs and noise_defs_lisa
provide a collection of basic and specialized noise types, via a unified protocol allowing
code to work with noises of all types. The module noise_gen_numpy provides a simple noise
generator based on numpy arrays. The streams package also contains noise generators in the
streams.noise and streams.noise_alt modules. All generators use the unified noise definitions.

The noise definition interface also provides a method to analytically compute the PSD of
the sampled noise as produced by the generators. This is not needed for the simulator,
except for testing, but may be useful on its own.
