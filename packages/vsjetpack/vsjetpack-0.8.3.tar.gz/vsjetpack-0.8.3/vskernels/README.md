# vs-kernels

Kernels are a collection of wrappers pertaining to (de)scaling, format conversion, and other related operations, all while providing a consistent and clean interface. This allows for easy expansion and ease of use for any other maintainers who wishes to use them in their own functions.

You can create presets for common scaling algorithms or settings, while ensuring the interface will always remain the same, even across different plugins with their own settings and expected behavior.
