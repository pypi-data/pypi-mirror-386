    Applies a fast vertical median or relaxed median filter to the clip
    using the [zsmooth](https://github.com/adworacz/zsmooth?tab=readme-ov-file#verticalcleaner) plugin.

    Example:
        ```py
        cleaned = vertical_cleaner(clip, vertical_cleaner.Mode.PRESERVING)
        ```

        Alternatively, directly using the enum:
        ```py
        cleaned = vertical_cleaner.Mode.PRESERVING(clip)
        ```

    Args:
        clip: Source clip to process.
        mode: Mode of vertical cleaning to apply.
            Can be:

               - A single enum/int (applied to all planes),
               - A sequence of enums/ints (one per plane).

        planes: Planes to process. Defaults to all.
