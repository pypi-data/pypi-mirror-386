/// tip
For step-by-step debugging with breakpoints and variable inspection (supported from `2.0.66` onward):
```console
# Install debugpy package
[uv] pip install debugpy
# Run agent with debugging enabled
uipath run [ENTRYPOINT] [INPUT] --debug
```
For vscode:
1. add the [debug configuration](https://github.com/UiPath/uipath-python/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json) in your `.vscode/launch.json` file.
2. Place breakpoints in your code where needed.
3. Use the shortcut `F5`, or navigate to Run -> Start Debugging -> Python Debugger: Attach.

Upon starting the debugging process, one should see the following logs in terminal:
```console
🐛 Debug server started on port 5678
📌 Waiting for debugger to attach...
  - VS Code: Run -> Start Debugging -> Python Debugger: Attach
✓  Debugger attached successfully!
