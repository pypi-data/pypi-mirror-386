SQLsaber supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, DuckDB, and CSV data sources. This guide covers all the ways to configure database connections.

### Supported Database Types

- **PostgreSQL** - Full support with SSL
- **MySQL** - Full support with SSL
- **SQLite** - Local database files
- **DuckDB** - Local DuckDB files or in-memory analytics
- **CSV** - Local CSV files

### Adding Database

```bash
saber db add my-database
```

This will prompt you for all necessary connection details.

### Connection Strings

SQLsaber supports direct connection strings for PostgreSQL and MySQL, plus file URIs for SQLite and DuckDB.

```bash
saber -d "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database"

saber -d "mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/database"

saber -d "duckdb:///path/to/data.duckdb"
```

### Files

#### SQLite

```bash
# Use SQLite file directly
saber -d "./data/sales.db" "Show me total sales by month"

# Relative paths work too
saber -d "~/Documents/mydata.db" "Count all records"
```

#### DuckDB

```bash
# Query a DuckDB file
saber -d "./warehouse/data.duckdb" "Show the latest partition"

# Use an absolute path
saber -d "duckdb:///Users/me/analytics.duckdb" "Describe orders"
```

#### CSV

SQLsaber can also analyze CSV files directly.

```bash
saber -d "./customers.csv" "How many customers are from each state?"
```

<Aside type="note">
  For CSV files, first row should contain column headers. SQLsaber will infer
  data types automatically.
</Aside>

### Managing Connections

#### List All Connections

```bash
saber db list
```

#### Set Default Database

If you have multiple databases, set one as default:

```bash
saber db set-default my-database
```

<Aside type="note">
  By default, SQLsaber will set the first added connection as default.
</Aside>

#### Test Connections

Verify that a database connection works:

```bash
saber db test my-database
```

#### Remove Connections

```bash
saber db remove my-database
```

### Security

#### Read-only Access

> **If you are using SQLsaber with a production database, we recommend setting up a read-only role for your database and using those credentials to setup connection in SQLsaber.**

While SQLsaber ensures, via checks before executing queries, that only read queries are executed and in our testing have observed that LLMs follow the system prompt of only generating read queries, there is no guarantee that this is fool-proof.

<Aside type="tip">
If you have a read-replica of your production database, consider using those credentials to setup connection.

In addition to the read-only role, this will provide additional layer of security and ensure no data modifying queries are executed.

</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
  For development setups, this isn't required but is a good practice if you wish
  to ensure with absolute certainty that no data modifying queries are ever
  executed.
</Aside>

#### Password Storage

SQLsaber stores database passwords securely using your operating system's credentials store.

#### SSL Certificates

Store SSL certificates in a secure location and use absolute paths when configuring connections.

### Schema Introspection Filters (PostgreSQL)

By default, SQLsaber excludes system and TimescaleDB internal schemas during schema discovery to keep results focused and fast.

Excluded by default:

- `pg_catalog`
- `information_schema`
- `_timescaledb_internal`
- `_timescaledb_cache`
- `_timescaledb_config`
- `_timescaledb_catalog`

You can exclude additional schemas via environment variable before running `saber`:

```bash
export SQLSABER_PG_EXCLUDE_SCHEMAS="schema1,schema2"
```

Both the `list_tables` and `introspect_schema` tools respect these filters.

### Troubleshooting

Always test new connections after adding them.

```bash
# Test the connection
saber db test my-database

# If connection fails, check the details
saber db list

# Update connection if needed
saber db remove my-database
saber db add my-database  # Start over with correct details
```

### Getting Help

Use the help commands for more information:

```bash
saber db --help
saber db add --help
```
