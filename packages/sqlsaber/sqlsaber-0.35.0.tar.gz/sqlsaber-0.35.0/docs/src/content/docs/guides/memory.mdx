description: Add context and memories to improve SQLsaber's responses

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

SQLsaber allows you to provide persistent context about your database, business rules, and preferences to the model via its memory system.

This helps the LLMs generate better queries and more relevant insights.

Memory entries are database-specific, persistent and flexible. They are available across all conversations and automatically included.

<Aside type="note">
If you are familiar with `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` file, this is exactly like that.

### Adding Memory

#### Via Command Line

Add memory entries using the CLI:

```bash
# Add memory for default database
saber memory add "Customer churn is calculated as customers lost / total customers at start of period"

# Add memory for specific database
saber memory add -d prod-db "Revenue is recognized when orders are shipped, not when placed"

# Add multiple types of context
saber memory add "Always format dates as YYYY-MM-DD for reports"
saber memory add "Fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31"
```

#### In Interactive Sessions

To add memory directly during conversations, start the message with `#` sign.

```
> # Our conversion rate is calculated as purchases / unique visitors

âœ“ Memory added
```

<Aside type="tip">
Any nuance or context that you think would help the model write better queries and generate more accurate insights can be included in memory.

A few examples:
- Business rules
- Data formatting preferences
- Domain knowledge
- Query preferences
- Data quality rules

### List All Memories

View all memory entries for your default database:

```bash
saber memory list
```

For a specific database:

```bash
saber memory list -d prod-db
```

### Remove Memory

Delete specific memory entries:

```bash
# Remove by memory ID (from list output)
saber memory remove a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

### Clear All Memory

Remove all memory entries for a database:

```bash
# Clear default database memory
saber memory clear

# Clear specific database memory
saber memory clear -d prod-db

# Confirmation will be requested for safety
```

### Be Specific and Clear

**Good memory entries:**
```bash
saber memory add "Exclude test accounts (user_id < 1000) from all customer metrics as they skew results"
saber memory add "Use shipped_date not order_date for revenue recognition per accounting rules"
```

**Avoid vague entries:**
```bash
# Too vague
saber memory add "Calculate things properly"
saber memory add "Use the right formula"
```

### Getting Help

Check memory commands and options:

```bash
saber memory --help
saber memory add --help
saber memory list --help
```
