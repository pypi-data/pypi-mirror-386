---

All notable changes to SQLsaber will be documented here.

### Unreleased

---

### v0.36.0 - 2025-10-23

#### Added

- `saber db exclude` command to manage schema exclusions without re-adding a connection, plus a `--exclude-schemas` flag when creating connections.
- Model name display in both interactive and non-interactive modes alongside database connection information.

#### Changed

- Schema exclusion configuration now applies to PostgreSQL, MySQL, DuckDB, and CSV connections, combining per-connection settings with environment variables such as `SQLSABER_MYSQL_EXCLUDE_SCHEMAS` and `SQLSABER_DUCKDB_EXCLUDE_SCHEMAS`.

#### Fixed

- Fixed ID column truncation in `saber threads list` on smaller terminal screens by ensuring full UUID visibility.

### v0.35.0 - 2025-10-22

#### Added

- Table and column comment support across all databases
  - Comments are now included in schema introspection to provide richer context to LLM
  - PostgreSQL: Uses `obj_description()` and `col_description()` functions
  - MySQL: Retrieves `table_comment` and `column_comment` from `information_schema`
  - DuckDB: Joins with `duckdb_tables()` and `duckdb_columns()` for comment data
  - SQLite: Returns `None` for comments (SQLite doesn't support native comments)
  - Comments are conditionally included in tool output only when present, avoiding clutter
  - Updated `ColumnInfo` and `SchemaInfo` TypedDicts with optional comment fields

#### Fixed

- Strip leading/trailing whitespace and new lines from submitted user inputs

### v0.34.0 - 2025-10-17

#### Changed

- Improved `auth setup` command: Reworked to select the provider first, offer to reset existing credentials per provider, and allow configuring multiple providers in one session without manual cleanup.
- PostgreSQL schema introspection: Exclude TimescaleDB internal schemas by default and add env-based filtering
  - Default exclusions now include `pg_catalog`, `information_schema`, `_timescaledb_internal`, `_timescaledb_cache`, `_timescaledb_config`, `_timescaledb_catalog`
  - New environment variable `SQLSABER_PG_EXCLUDE_SCHEMAS` allows excluding additional schemas (comma-separated)
  - Applies to both `list_tables` and `introspect_schema` tools

### v0.33.0 - 2025-10-16

#### Changed

- Improved system prompt for GPT-5 using OpenAI's prompt optimizer tool
- Improved system prompt for Sonnet 4.5 and others using Anthropic's prompt improvement tool
- Dedicated prompt for GPT-5

### v0.32.1 - 2025-10-15

#### Fixed

- Prevented `saber auth setup` from crashing when launching Anthropic OAuth by moving the browser authentication flow onto a background thread, avoiding nested asyncio event loops.

### v0.32.0 - 2025-10-14

#### Added

- Optional MLflow autologging
  - Set `MLFLOW_URI` and `MLFLOW_EXP` before running `sqlsaber` to forward telemetry via `mlflow.pydantic_ai.autolog()` with no runtime requirement when the MLflow package is absent.

### v0.31.0 - 2025-10-13

#### Added

- Structured logging across the project
  - Centralized setup with JSON logs to a rotating file by default
  - Daily rotation at midnight (configurable), with backups retained
  - Optional pretty console output in development via `SQLSABER_LOG_TO_STDERR=1` or `SQLSABER_DEBUG=1`
  - Captures stdlib logging and Python warnings into the same pipeline
  - Environment variables to control behavior: `SQLSABER_LOG_LEVEL`, `SQLSABER_LOG_FILE`, `SQLSABER_LOG_ROTATION`, `SQLSABER_LOG_WHEN`, `SQLSABER_LOG_INTERVAL`, `SQLSABER_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT`, `SQLSABER_LOG_MAX_BYTES`

### v0.30.2 - 2025-10-10

#### Changed
