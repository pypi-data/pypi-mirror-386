> SQLsaber is an open-source agentic SQL assistant that helps you interact with your databases using natural language.

It autonomously fetches the right context, writes appropriate SQL queries, and provides insights based on the resulting data.


### `uv` (Recommended)

```bash
uv tool install sqlsaber
```

<Aside type="note">
If you don't have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed, you can install it first using:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
```
</Aside>

### `pipx`

```bash
pipx install sqlsaber
```

### Homebrew

For `homebrew` or `linuxbrew` users, you can use Homebrew to install both `uv` and `sqlsaber`.

```bash
brew install uv
uv tool install sqlsaber
```
