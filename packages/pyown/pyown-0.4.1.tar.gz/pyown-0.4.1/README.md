This is a Python library to connect and parse OpenWebNet messages from Bticino/Legrand gateways.

Currently, it is a WIP, but it is already able to connect to the gateway and manages lighting or automation devices.

## What is OpenWebNet?

OpenWebNet is a home automation protocol developed by Bticino (now part of Legrand) to control domotic devices like
lights, shutters, heating, etc.
It was developed around 2000, and it's still used today in many installations.
It does not implement any encryption, so it is not secure to use it over the internet.
Also, many devices implement only the old password algorithm, which is easily bruteforceable.
So, when using OpenWebNet, be sure to use it only in a trusted network and taking security measures, like vlan
separation.
