        Proof:
        1. Since M_B is a boundary manifold, it separates distinct semantic clusters C₁, C₂.
        
        2. Let y ∈ M_B be arbitrary. Then ∃ε > 0 such that ∀δ ∈ (0,ε):
           B(y,δ) ∩ C₁ ≠ ∅ and B(y,δ) ∩ C₂ ≠ ∅
        
        3. Since g is a smooth embedding, it is a homeomorphism onto its image.
           Therefore, g preserves topological properties.
        
        4. For z = g(y), consider B(z,δ') where δ' = inf{||g(u) - g(v)|| : ||u-v|| = δ}.
           Since g is continuous, δ' > 0.
        
        5. By continuity of g⁻¹ on g(Y), we have:
           B(z,δ') ∩ g(C₁) ⊇ g(B(y,δ) ∩ C₁) ≠ ∅
           B(z,δ') ∩ g(C₂) ⊇ g(B(y,δ) ∩ C₂) ≠ ∅
        
        6. Therefore, z = g(y) lies on the boundary between g(C₁) and g(C₂).

        1. The manifold construction uses k-nearest neighbors and clustering.

        2. Let L₁ be the Lipschitz constant for the k-NN graph construction,
