[2025-03-06 11:43:38] WARNING [data-conversion.__init__:350] :
Potential data loss or extrapolation issues with the conversion from xyz to cif:
- Potential data loss: 2D atomic coordinates are represented in the input format, but its representation in the output format is unknown
- Potential data loss: 2D atomic coordinates are represented in the input format, but its representation in the output format is unknown
- Potential data loss: Atomic composition is represented in the input format, but its representation in the output format is unknown
- Potential data loss: Atomic connections are represented in the input format, but its representation in the output format is unknown
