        for example, for 12 teams league, the best team in assists has 12, the next 11 and so on.
        total points is the sum of the points in all categories, so the best team in total points has the most points.
        rank is the rank of the team in the league, the best team has rank 1, the next 2 and so on.

        - Use the "status" field to filter between rostered players, free agents, and waivers
        - Use "has_more" to determine if you need to fetch additional pages
        - "total_count" tells you the total number of players available
        - All stats are averaged per game except "gp" which is total games played
