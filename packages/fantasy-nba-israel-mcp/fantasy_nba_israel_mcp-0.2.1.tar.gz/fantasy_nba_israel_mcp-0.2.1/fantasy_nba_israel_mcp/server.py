        in each statistical category (except for total points and rank), the higher thee value is, the better the team is.
        for example, for 12 teams league, the best team in assists has 12, the next 11 and so on.
        total points is the sum of the points in all categories, so the best team in total points has the most points.
        rank is the rank of the team in the league, the best team has rank 1, the next 2 and so on.
