"""
Event handlers for incident processing.

This module contains handlers for processing incident events based on different
handler types (job, email, notify, ticket). These handlers are used by the RuleSet.run_handler
method to handle events that match rule criteria.
Supported handler schemes:
- job://name?param1=value1
- email://recipient@example.com
- notify://user-or-channel
- ticket://?status=open&priority=8
