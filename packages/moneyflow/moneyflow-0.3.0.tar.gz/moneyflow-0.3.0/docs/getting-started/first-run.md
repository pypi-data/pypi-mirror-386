Currently, only **Monarch Money** is supported, but the architecture is designed for easy addition of other platforms.

## Monarch Money Setup

### Prerequisites

You'll need:

1. **Monarch Money account** - Active subscription
2. **2FA secret key** - For automatic login

### Getting Your 2FA Secret

!!! warning "Do this BEFORE running moneyflow"

    1. Log into [Monarch Money](https://app.monarchmoney.com/)
    2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Security**
    3. **Disable** your existing 2FA
    4. **Re-enable** 2FA
    5. When shown the QR code, click **"Can't scan?"**
    6. Copy the **BASE32 secret** (e.g., `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`)
    7. Save this somewhere secure

### Credential Setup

Launch moneyflow:

```bash
moneyflow
```

You'll be prompted for your credentials:

![Credential setup screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesm/moneyflow-assets/main/monarch-credentials.png)

#### 1. Monarch Money Credentials

- **Email**: Your Monarch Money login email
- **Password**: Your Monarch Money password
- **2FA Secret**: The secret key from above

#### 2. Encryption Password

Create a **NEW password** to encrypt your stored credentials:

- This is **only for moneyflow**, not Monarch Money
- Choose something memorable - you'll need it every time you launch
- Minimum 8 characters recommended

!!! info "How Credentials Are Stored"
    Your Monarch Money credentials are encrypted with AES-128 using PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations) and stored at:

    ```
    ~/.moneyflow/credentials.enc
    ```

    Only you can decrypt them with your encryption password.

## Subsequent Runs

After initial setup, you only need your **encryption password**:

```bash
moneyflow
# Enter encryption password: ********
# Loading...
```

---

## Reset Credentials

If you forget your encryption password or want to reconfigure:

1. **In the app**: Click "Reset Credentials" on unlock screen
2. **Manually**: Delete credentials and start fresh:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.moneyflow/
   moneyflow
   ```

## Troubleshooting Setup

### "Incorrect password" when unlocking

- You're entering the **encryption password** (the one YOU created for moneyflow)
- Not your Monarch Money password
- If you forgot it, click "Reset Credentials"
