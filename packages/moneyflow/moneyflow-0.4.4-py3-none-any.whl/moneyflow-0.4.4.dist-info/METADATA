## Amazon Mode

Import and analyze your Amazon purchase history:

1. Request "Your Orders" export from Amazon (Account Settings → Privacy)
2. Download and unzip "Your Orders.zip"

4. Launch: `moneyflow amazon`

See [Amazon Mode Guide](https://moneyflow.dev/guide/amazon-mode) for details.

## Troubleshooting

**Login fails with "Incorrect password"**
→ Enter your **encryption password** (for moneyflow), not your Monarch password
→ If forgotten: Click "Reset Credentials" or delete `~/.moneyflow/`

**2FA not working**
→ Copy the BASE32 secret (long string), not the QR code
→ Get fresh secret: Disable and re-enable 2FA in Monarch Money

**Terminal displays weird characters**
→ Use a modern terminal with Unicode support (iTerm2, GNOME Terminal, Windows Terminal)

**Complete reset**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.moneyflow/
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall moneyflow
moneyflow
```
