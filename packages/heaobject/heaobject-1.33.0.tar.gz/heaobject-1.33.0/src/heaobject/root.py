A collection of classes and interfaces supporting the construction of data transfer objects for moving data between
HEA microservices as well as between a HEA microservice and a web browser or other client. The HEAObject is the root
interface for these data transfer objects, and AbstractHEAObject provides a root abstract implementation for them.

class HEAObject(abc.ABC):
    """
    Interface for all HEA objects. HEA objects are data transfer objects for moving data between HEA microservices as
    well as between a HEA microservice and a web browser or other client. HEA objects have no behavior except support
    for storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization. The AbstractHEAObject class provides default
    implementations for setting and getting attributes, as well as default implementations of behaviors.

    Users of these classes should not assume that attributes are implemented as properties, even though most
    attributes are properties currently. We have begun converting attribute implementations to use the descriptor
    protocol, and that conversion will continue into the future.

    HEA objects have built-in facilities for extracting the object's data attributes into a dictionary or JSON string
    (the get_attributes(), to_dict() and to_json() methods). These methods are used by other parts of HEA to
    build REST API responses. These three methods support monkey-patched data attributes. However, from_dict() and
    from_json() will only set data attributes that already exist in the object.

    There are two sub-types of HEA objects: desktop objects (DesktopObject) and owned
    objects (MemberObject). The AbstractDesktopObject and AbstractMemberObject classes provide default implementations
    for setting and getting attributes, and default implementations of behaviors. There may be additional sub-types in
    the future.

    Desktop objects represent objects that appear on the HEA desktop. Desktop objects have permissions, timestamps for
    when the object was created and modified, versions, and more. One or more HEA microservices provide CRUD (create,
    read, update, and delete) operations on each desktop object type. Additional HEA microservices may implement actions
    that consume or produce specific desktop object types.

    Member objects cannot appear by themselves on the HEA desktop. Instead, they have a part-of relationship with a
    desktop object, and their lifecycle is managed by the desktop object. Example member objects represent permissions
    and data sharing. While owned objects provide for their own storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization,
    these behaviors are always invoked by the desktop object of which they are a part. HEA objects may contain only one
    level of nested members.

    HEA objects must conform to several conventions to ease their use and reuse across the HEA desktop.
    All subclasses of HEAObject must have a zero-argument constructor. Attribute values may be strings, numbers, booleans,
    enums, or a HEA object; or a list of strings, numbers, booleans, enums, or HEA objects. Attributes of type enum
    must be implemented as an attribute with a setter that accepts both strings and the enum values, and will convert
    the strings to enum values. An HEAObject's repr is expected to conform to `eval(repr(obj)) == obj`, and the repr is
    expected to stay the same so long as the state of the object does not change.

    In general, HEA objects implement composition relationships by making the container a desktop object and the "owned"
    object a member object. Other association relationships are implemented by storing the id of the associated object
    rather than nesting it. By convention, the id attributes are named hea_object_class_name_id, where
    hea_object_class_name is the name of the class converted from camel case to underscores.

    Copies and deep copies using the copy module will copy all non-callable instance members of any subclass of
    HEAObject. HEAObjects are also expected to implement the __eq__ method based on their attributes to ensure proper
    behavior in comparisons. The abstract base class, AbstractHEAObject, provides a default implementation that is
    suitable for most purposes.

    Attributes of an HEAObject must never raise an error because another attribute is unset.

    Objects are expected to perform defensive copying when setting and getting attributes so that altering an
    attribute's value from outside of the object cannot affect the object's internal state.

    Objects are expected to allow setting primitive type sequence attributes to a single object of the allowed type, in
    which case the attribute is stored as a singleton sequence containing that object. Unfortunately, there is no way
    to specify type hints for properties in which the getter type may be different from the setter type. The from_dict()
    method relies on this behavior.

    In addition, HEA objects should include type annotations throughout. Despite the type annotations, all setters
    should have comprehensive validation to ensure that the object is in a valid state after the setter is called. The
    setters may be called by the from_dict() method, which does not perform None nor type checks.

    It is imperative that users gain access to desktop objects by calling an appropriate HEA microservice as
    themselves, which will filter any nested member objects that are returned according to their permissions.

    HEA has an access control list-based permissions system that covers a wide range of use cases. Like with Unix-based
    systems, there are users (heaobject.person.Person) and groups (heaobject.person.Group), and they all may have one
    or more of the following permissions on a per-object level, which are defined in the heaobject.root.Permission
    enum:
    * VIEWER: Can access the object but not necessarily alter it.
    * EDITOR: Can update the object.
    * DELETER: Can delete the object.
    * SHARER: Can share the object with users and groups.
    * CREATOR: Used on containers to indicate the users who can create objects in that container.
    * COOWNER: All of the above.

    Users and groups are represented interchangeably by instances of the Person and Group classes or by unique strings.
    For users, the string is the Person's id attribute, and for groups, the string is the group's group attribute.

    There are multiple ways that permissions can be granted:
    1. **Owner**: The user who creates the object is the owner and has maximal permissions for the object and its
    attributes. Owners and super admins may reassign an object's ownership to another user, after which the new owner
    has all the same permissions on the object.
    2. **User Shares**: The owner can share the object with users, granting them specific permissions.
    3. **Group Shares**: The owner can share the object with groups, granting all members of the group specific
    permissions. Similarly, other users with SHARER permissions can grant additional permissions to groups. Dynamic
    permissions may also grant ability to share the object with groups.
    4. **Dynamic Permissions**: Some objects may have dynamic permissions that are determined by the object's
    attributes or other factors. For example, organizations have admin, manager, and member list attributes, which
    determine the permissions of users in those "roles."

    The user's effective object-level permissions are the union of all permissions granted to them through these
    methods. For convenience, the desktop object read-only shares attribute contains all user and group shares for an
    object.

    There are several system-defined users that make for more convenient permission management:
    * **system|none**: Requests to a HEA microservice must never be from this user. This is a convenience user for
        testing purposes, and in production it can be used as the owner user for objects that are globally read-only like
        registry component objects.
    * **system|all**: This user is used to grant permissions to all users. It is typically used in conjunction with
        system|none to create globally read-only objects. This is achieved by setting the owner to system|none and sharing
        the object with system|all with VIEWER permissions.

    Furthermore, an HEA object's class definition can define attribute-level permissions that restrict access beyond
    the user's effective object-level permissions. This allows for fine-grained control over who can access and modify
    specific attributes of an object. This may be done through the following mechanisms:
    * **heaobject.decorators.attribute_metadata**: This decorator can be used to mark attributes as globally read-only
        for all users, even for attributes that have a setter. This allows code to set values for those attributes but
        presents those attributes as read-only to users. Attributes with no setter are automatically presented as
        read-only through application programming interfaces for accessing attribute-level permissions.
    * **The DesktopObject dynamic_attribute_permission method**: this method is checked only when the user is not the
        object's owner and is not listed in a user or group share. By default, it returns VIEWER-only permissions for
        the owner, invites, user_shares, and group_shares attributes. It can be overridden in subclasses to provide
        custom permissions for users who have access solely through the dynamic permission method above.

    Attribute-level permissions are always a combination of VIEWER and EDITOR permissions. Also note that attribute-
    level permissions restrict access beyond the user's effective object-level permissions, meaning that if a user
    has VIEWER but not EDITOR permissions on an object, they will also have at most VIEWER permissions on all of that
    object's attributes.

    Finally, to support integration with data providers, groups can be mapped to a role that's known to a data
    provider, which allows for interfacing with providers that employ role-based access control, for example, Amazon
    Web Services.

    desired set of permissions, and the user will receive access upon accepting the invite. Permission assignment
    objects are owned by a desktop object.

    Permission assignments can be made to users or groups, but a PermissionAssignment object may only assign

    will be ignored. However, the system|none user is available for automated testing purposes.

    Helper class for determining object and attribute permissions. This class is a default implementation. Subclasses
    may be needed to consult external sources for permissions information, for example, when representing cloud data

    get_association_many(), and get_groups() for custom functionality, though unless otherwise documented, all methods
    may be overridden if there is a performance benefit to doing so. Responses from external sources of permissions may
    be cached in the subclass to improve performance. The default implementation must be overridden by subclasses to
    provide group membership. Due the caching, it is recommended that PermissionContext objects be relatively
    short-lived.

    This implementation is all that is needed for desktop objects for determining permissions for the object's owner
    because by definition the owner has maximal permissions for the object and all its attributes. An external source
    would at most restrict access to the object and its attributes. Subclasses of this class must return the exact same
    permissions as this one for the object's owner.

class DesktopObject(HEAObject, abc.ABC):
    """
    Interface for objects that can appear on the HEA desktop. Desktop objects have permissions, with those permissions
    represented by owned objects implementing the MemberObject interface. Other attributes may also employ owned
    objects. One or more HEA microservices provide CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on each desktop
    object type. Additional HEA microservices may implement actions that use specific desktop object types.

    Desktop objects implement no capability to check the current user when getting and setting owned objects, and
    different users may only have access to a subset of its owned objects. Similarly, owned objects have no knowledge of
    permissions at all. It is imperative that users gain access to desktop objects by calling an appropriate HEA
    microservice as themselves, which will filter the owned objects that are returned according to their permissions.

    Desktop objects may employ the following permission checks to determine whether to return a desktop object to a
    user or save the desktop object with a user's changes. Attribute-level permissions checks are also available.

    1) User-based: if the user is the object's owner, then the user can do anything with the object.
    2) Group-based: if the user is a member of the super-admin group, and the object's super_admin_has_all_permission
    attribute is set to True, then the user can do anything with the object.
    3) Shares-based: if the owner has shared the object with a user, then the user can use the object according to the
    values of the heaobject.root.Permission enum specified in the Share object.
    4) Dynamic permissions: Implemented using the dynamic_permission and dynamic_attribute_permission methods, they use
    the object's attribute values to determine the user's permissions. They will only be invoked if the object's
    dynamic_permission_supported attribute is True.
    5) The permissions context: a heaobject.root.PermissionContext object is passed into all the desktop object
    permissions checking methods except for the dynamic permissions methods above. The default permissions context
    implementation, PermissionContext, checks aggregates user and shares-based permissions, and if the object's
    dynamic_permission_supported attribute is True, adds any permissions returned by the dyanmic_permission and
    dynamic_atribute_permission methods. Subclasses may perform addition permissions checking or override the above
    checks and implement their own.

    The permissions granted will be the greatest of the above checks. Being an object's owner trumps everything. The
    shares-based and dynamic permissions-based approaches both return heaobject.root.Permission objects, and the most
    permissive permissions prevail.

    Objects may have any of the permissions in the Permissions enum. Attributes may only have the Permission.VIEWER
    and/or the Permission.EDITOR permissions. The PermissionContext class grants the id, modified, and created
    attributes only Permission.VIEWER permissions, and it grants all other attributes Permission.VIEWER and
    Permission.EDITOR permissions. Object-level permissions override attribute-level permissions. For example, an
    object cannot grant a user Permission.EDITOR permissions to an attribute if the user's object-level permissions do
    not include Permission.EDITOR or Permission.COOWNER. Subclasses of PermissionContext should honor this constraint.

    When updating and persisting an object, implementations must ensure that attributes for which the user lacks the
    Permission.EDITOR privilege are NOT updated, in other words, those attributes must retain the previously persisted
    values.

    If a microservice provides an object to a user who is not the object's owner, and the object has not been shared
    with the user, this should be interpreted as unknown permissions. In this situation, the microservices responsible
    for the object must deny operations that the user might attempt on the object for which the user lacks the
    necessary permissions. An example where this situation might occur is when a user accesses desktop objects
    representing data in a cloud storage service that has its own permissions system and correctly denies access when
    the user lacks the necessary permissions, but the service lacks APIs for querying those permissions.

    Desktop objects may have a class variable, associations, with type Dict[attribute, str]. For properties ending in
    _id or _ids that represent an association relationship with another desktop object type, it defines the type name
    of the desktop object being referred to. The associations variable is intended to have many purposes. In the future,
    implementations of the dynamic_permission() method might use these annotations to traverse an association
    relationship to another desktop object as part of permissions checking.

    Desktop objects may be versioned, indicated by the presence of a version attribute. For convenience, the
    VersionedDesktopObject and AbstractVersionedDesktopObject classes provide a default implementation of this
    attribute. Desktop objects represent one version of the actual persisted object.

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def id(self) -> Optional[str]:
        """
        The object's resource unique identifier. It must be unique among all
        objects of the same type. The id is expected to be generated by a
        database in which the objects are stored, thus prior to storing the
        object the id is expected to be None. In a client-server application,
        the id is generated on the server side and provided back to the client.
        The id may not be the empty string.

        When an application needs to store updates of an object in a database,
        the application should first arrange to store the original version of
        the object and get its generated id back from the database for use in
        subsequent updates. However, in asynchronous operations this may not be
        possible, such as when an object and updates to it are sent over a
        message queue. In a message queue, the sender may generate updates to
        an object before the receiver finishes processing the original object
        version.

        In this case, the application must generate and maintain its own object
        id, and the object class should provide a different attribute for the
        application to store it. The database will still generate its id and
        store it in the id field, thus the object will have two unique ids, a
        database-generated id and an application-generated id. Typical methods
        for generating ids on the application side such as UUIDs are highly
        reliable but may be somewhat less reliable over the long term than
        database-generated ids. Thus, applications should use database-
        generated ids whenever feasible and treat application-generated ids as
        temporary. Applications should link the database- and application-
        generated ids. In a client-server application, this must happen server-
        side so that the server can appropriately store objects received from
        the client with only an application-generated id. However, the client
        could maintain its own linkage if necessary.

        In client-server applications with multiple server processes such as
        microservices, application-generated ids should be based upon unique
        identifiers of the source of the object, which depending on the
        architecture might include IP address or other form of host identifier,
        so that objects generated by separate server processes cannot clash.
        Consider security concerns if the generated ids may become visible to
        users.

        For some HEAObject classes, it may be natural for its unique id to be
        a string with characters that cannot be incorporated into a URL's path,
        such as /. The same is true for HEAObject's name attribute. For this
        situation, we recommend encoding the value using URL-safe base 64
        encoding as described in IETF RFC 4648 section 5, and adding a custom
        attribute to the class for storing the actual id/name value. The id,
        name, and custom attributes can be synchronized such that setting the
        custom attribute automatically generates an encoded value that can be
        accessed via the id and/or name attributes. The id may not be the empty
        string.

    """
    Abstract base class for all HEA objects. HEA objects are data transfer objects for moving data between HEA
    microservices as well as between a HEA microservice and a web browser or other client. HEA objects have no behavior
    except support for storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization. The AbstractHEAObject class provides
    default implementations for setting and getting attributes, as well as default implementations of behaviors.

    There are two sub-types of HEA objects: desktop objects (DesktopObject) and owned
    objects (MemberObject). The AbstractDesktopObject and AbstractMemberObject classes provide default implementations
    for setting and getting attributes, and default implementations of behaviors. There may be additional sub-types in
    the future.

    Desktop objects represent objects that appear on the HEA desktop. Desktop objects have permissions, timestamps for
    when the object was created and modified, versions, and more. One or more HEA microservices provide CRUD (create,
    read, update, and delete) operations on each desktop object type. Additional HEA microservices may implement actions
    that consume or produce specific desktop object types.

    Owned objects cannot appear by themselves on the HEA desktop. Instead, they have a part-of relationship with a
    desktop object, and their lifecycle is managed by the desktop object. Example owned objects represent permissions
    and data sharing. While owned objects provide for their own storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization,
    these behaviors are always invoked by the desktop object of which they are a part.

    HEA object implementations must conform to several conventions to ease their use and reuse across the HEA desktop.
    All subclasses of HEAObject must have a zero-argument constructor. All non-callable instance members must be
    included in the to_dict() and json_dumps() methods. Copies and deep copies using the copy module will copy all
    non-callable instance members of any subclass of HEAObject. Override __copy__ and __deepcopy__ to change that
    behavior. In addition, HEA objects should include type annotations for all properties and callables.

    Desktop objects implement no capability to check the current user when getting and setting owned objects, and
    different users may only have access to a subset of its owned objects. Similarly, owned objects have no knowledge of
    permissions at all. It is imperative that users gain access to desktop objects by calling an appropriate HEA
    microservice as themselves, which will filter the owned objects that are returned according to their permissions.

    Microservices may implement subclasses of Version if their versions have extra attributes or their attributes need
    custom validation logic.

    View mixin. Views are desktop objects that are automatically managed alternative representations of some other
    desktop object. Acting on a view also acts on the other desktop object, and vice-versa. A desktop object can have
    multiple views served by different endpoints, all of which synchronize with the corresponding desktop object.
    Create a view class by extending both heaobject.root.DesktopObject (or a subclass) and this class. In addition to
    the attributes provided by this mixin, microservices are expected to populate a view's attributes from those of the
    desktop object for all attributes that overlap. Furthermore, submitting a view object to a PUT, POST, or DELETE
    endpoint must also update the corresponding desktop object. A client must be able to work with views and their
    corresponding desktop objects interchangeably, and synchronization between the two must be immediate such that a
    workflow must be able to submit a change to a view and subsequently request the corresponding desktop object,
    and the changes in the view must reflect in the desktop object.

    A View's type_display_name attribute is expected to be equal to the type_display_name of the other desktop object
    it represents.

    Views are different from MacOS or Windows aliases. While aliases can be modified and deleted without affecting
    the object that they point to, and changes to an object may or may not affect its aliases, changes to HEA views
    always change the corresponding desktop object and vice-versa. HEA defines an heaobject.root.Alias mixin as a
    placeholder for supporting desktop objects in the future that have similar properties to MacOS and Windows aliases.
