    Abstract base class for recording user activity. Activities have three
    statuses: requested, began, and ended. Subclasses may introduce additional
    statuses. Concrete implementations of Activity must at minimum provide
    implementations of the requested, began, and ended attributes. Note that
    these timestamps are different from the standard created and modified
    timestamps that all desktop objects have. Requested, began, and ended
    should be set by the service orchestrating the activity. The created and
    modified attributes are set when the activity is persisted.

    Activity objects, like other desktop objects, have an id attribute that is
    generated when the object is stored. Activity objects also have an
    application-generated id for situations where it is desirable to record
    changes in an action's state prior to the object being stored (such as when
