pyFFTW v0.15.0 release notes
============================

We're happy to announce the release of pyFFTW v0.15.0!

pyFFTW is a pythonic wrapper around FFTW 3, the speedy FFT library. The
ultimate aim is to present a unified interface for all the possible transforms
that FFTW can perform.

pyFFTW implements the NumPy and SciPy FFT interfaces in order for users to take
advantage of the speed of FFTW with minimal code modifications. A Dask FFT
interface is provided as a drop-in replacement for the equivalent module in
dask. For more information, examples, and documentation, please see
the `documentation <https://pyfftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

A highlight of this release is compatibility with Python 3.13 and GCC 14.
This release supports Python 3.10-3.13 on Windows, MacOS and Linux. For more
details on the architectures providing binary wheels on PyPI, see the
full `table of prebuilt wheels <https://github.com/pyFFTW/pyFFTW#wheels>`_.

Moreover, pyFFTW now exposes ``fftw*_version``, ``fftw*_cc`` and
``fftw*_codelet_optim`` of the fftw library (see :ref:`Query the version and compiler flags of FFTW`)
