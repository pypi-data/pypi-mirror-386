"Name","Match Scores","Match to Archetype","Explanation"
"Dolet Hills","{4: 0.94, 5: 0.06}","Perfect Match","Plant's high operating costs and utility cost reduction efforts directly match Group 4's primary driver of high operating costs."
"Martin Drake // South Plant","{7: 1.0}","Close Match","Plant is retiring due to aging and transition to cleaner energy, but were previously in violation of federal air quality regulations and, as such, match the `Air Quality Offenders' Group 7 archetype."
"E D Edwards","{6: 1.0}","Partial Match","Plant closed due to legal settlement from environmental violations. This partially aligns with Group 6's `Political Opposition' (manifested as regulatory and legal action) and indirectly with `State-driven climate goals' which often underpin such environmental standards."
"Lowman Energy Center","{0: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Plant's aging infrastructure and coal ash pond violation directly match Group 0's primary drivers. The fuel blend note reinforces this."
"Waukegan","{4: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Plant's poor financial results and economic pressures directly align with Group 4's high operating costs, and the utility transition matches secondary drivers."
"Escalante","{4: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Plant's economic in-viability and competition from renewables align perfectly with Group 4's archetype of high operating costs making plants expensive and uncompetitive."
"Will County","{5: 0.07, 6: 0.93}","Perfect Match","Plant's retirement driven by state climate goals, renewable mandates, and economic difficulties directly aligns with Group 6's primary and secondary drivers."
"Oklaunion","{3: 0.95, 5: 0.05}","Partial Match","Plant drivers are economic in-viability and aging/retrofit costs. Group 3 focuses on public health and environmental regulations. While high retrofit costs match the environment regulations focus and secondary economic driver of group 3, the primary stated drivers for the plant do not strongly align with Group 3's primary focus on health impacts or direct regulatory pressure."
"Joppa Steam","{2: 0.915, 6: 0.085}","Partial Match","Plant drivers are economic and aging. Group 2's primary focus is political/regulatory pressure. While economic issues can be a secondary consequence in Group 2, the plant's stated reasons don't highlight the primary political/regulatory drivers of the archetype."
"Bridgeport Station","{0: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Utility net zero target and replacement with natural gas are both aligned with Group 0's archetypes."
"Crawfordsville Power Plant","{6: 1.0}","Partial Match","Plant's retirement is due to aging infrastructure. While Group 6 includes `aging coal plants no longer cost-competitive' as a secondary driver, the primary drivers are political opposition and broader economic difficulties, which are not explicitly stated for the plant. Aging can contribute, but isn't the core of Group 6."
"C D McIntosh Jr","{0: 0.98, 1: 0.02}","Close Match","Plant's aging infrastructure and increasing operational costs align well with one of Group 0's primary drivers. The fuel blend note is also consistent. Lacks explicit mention of regulatory non-compliance for a perfect match."
"Lansing","{2: 0.095, 5: 0.07, 4: 0.835}","Close Match","Plant's retirement due to utility's clean energy transition plan and emissions reduction aligns well with Group 4's secondary drivers. While not explicitly stating 'high operating costs' as the primary reason, these transition plans often target such plants."
"R Gallagher","{2: 0.085, 4: 0.915}","Close Match","Plant's retirement due to an `Economic Decision' strongly suggests alignment with Group 4's core theme of high costs, making it expensive to operate. Lacks specific details for a perfect match."
"Elmer Smith","{4: 0.95, 5: 0.05}","Perfect Match","The explicit statements that the retirement is `purely economical' and due to `faltering economics' perfectly match Group 4's primary driver of high operating costs."
"Morgantown Generating Plant","{0: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Plant drivers of aging infrastructure, regulatory non-compliance, and coal ash pond violation are a perfect match for Group 0's primary and secondary drivers."
"Paradise","{4: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Plant's retirement due to environmental regulations, economic factors, and emissions reduction aligns perfectly with Group 4's primary (high operating/retrofit costs due to regulations) and secondary drivers (utility/state targets)."
"Dan E Karn","{0: 1.0}","Close Match","Plant's aging infrastructure and alignment with renewable targets match Group 0's primary driver of aging and secondary drivers related to clean energy transitions. The fuel blend note is consistent. Lacks explicit mention of regulatory non-compliance for a perfect match."
"Kenneth C Coleman","{3: 1.0}","Weak Match","Plant drivers are aging and economic factors. Group 3's primary focus is public health and environmental regulations. While economic difficulties can be a secondary factor in Group 3 if linked to compliance, the primary drivers stated for the plant do not align with Group 3's main archetype."
"St Clair","{2: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Plant's retirement due to failure to meet air quality standards (regulatory pressure), state climate goals, and renewable mandates directly aligns with Group 2's primary and secondary drivers."
"Chalk Point LLC","{0: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Plant's aging infrastructure and regulatory non-compliance (evidenced by water pollution violations) perfectly match Group 0's primary drivers."
"Trenton Channel","{0: 1.0}","Partial Match","Plant's `Utility Net Zero' goal aligns with Group 0 secondary drivers."
"Dickerson","{2: 0.905, 0: 0.095}","Close Match","Plant's `high compliance costs' strongly suggest retirement due to regulatory pressure making it uneconomic, aligning well with Group 2's primary theme of political/regulatory pressure and its secondary driver of becoming uneconomic due to standards."
"Meramec","{6: 0.13, 4: 0.78, 2: 0.09}","Perfect Match","Plant's retirement due to environmental regulations, economic factors, and emissions reduction aligns perfectly with Group 4's primary (high operating/retrofit costs due to regulations) and secondary drivers (utility/state targets)."
"River Rouge","{4: 0.96, 5: 0.04}","Close Match","Plant's retirement due to utility's clean energy transition plan and emissions reduction aligns well with Group 4's secondary drivers. These transition plans often target expensive plants, fitting the Group 4 archetype."
"San Juan","{0: 1.0}","Close Match","Plant's coal ash pond violation (regulatory non-compliance) and environmental justice concerns align very well with Group 0's primary and secondary drivers. Lacks explicit `aging infrastructure' for a perfect score."
"J B Sims","{2: 1.0}","Weak Match","Plant's driver is aging infrastructure and economic invibility. Group 2's primary focus is political/regulatory pressure. However, while this plant was not specifically retired for environmental reasons, it is in Michigan and its retirement furthered GHG reduction goals and helps to meet RPS standards. Therefore, it is a weak match but still meets Group 2's driver of: strong state-level emissions or cleanenergy mandates"
"Dunkirk Generating Plant","{0: 1.0}","Close Match","Plant's aging infrastructure and increasing operational costs align with a primary driver of Group 0. The attempted (but costly) NG conversion is also thematically relevant to 'Fuel Blend Plants'. Lacks explicit regulatory non-compliance."
"Eckert Station","{3: 1.0}","Partial Match","Plant's retirement is due to a utility's clean energy transition and emissions reduction. Group 3's core is public health concerns and environmental regulations. While emissions reduction benefits health, the plant's stated drivers don't specifically highlight existing high health impacts or direct regulatory pressure due to health as the *primary* cause."
"R M Heskett","{6: 1.0}","Close Match","Plant's aging infrastructure, economic factors, and high maintenance costs align well with Group 6's `Economic Difficulties' primary driver and its `aging plants no longer cost-competitive' secondary driver. Lacks explicit mention of 'political opposition.'"
"Hoot Lake","{4: 0.97, 5: 0.03}","Close Match","The plant's extreme age (100 years) strongly implies it would face high operating costs and significant retrofit requirements to continue, aligning it closely with the 'Expensive Plants' archetype of Group 4."
"Asbury","{3: 1.0}","Partial Match","Plant's high operating and retrofit costs could align with Group 3 if these costs are driven by environmental regulations related to health impacts. It matches the `economic difficulties due to compliance' secondary driver, but lacks explicit mention of primary health concerns or health-driven regulations."
"Avon Lake","{4: 1.0}","Perfect Match","The explicit statement about economic reasons ('Over the past few years, the plant...') directly matches Group 4's primary driver of high operating costs making the plant expensive."
"Asheville","{5: 0.05, 0: 0.925, 1: 0.025}","Close Match","Plant's `Economic In-viability' is the driver. Group 0's primary drivers are Aging Infrastructure \\ Regulatory Non-Compliance. That said, although not an explicit driver, the plant had coal ash problems and radiated ground water. This plant gets a Close Match due to these coal ash violations and being a fuel-blend plant, but not a perfect match due the mismatch in primary drivers."
"W H Sammis","{4: 1.0}","Close Match","Plant's retirement due to `Utility-driven clean energy transitions' aligns well with Group 4's secondary drivers, as such transitions often prioritize retiring expensive coal plants."
"Conesville","{2: 0.995, 0: 0.005}","Close Match","Plant's 'Regulatory Non-Compliance' aligns with Group 2's `Regulatory Pressure,' and `Economic In-viability' matches a secondary outcome. Aging can contribute. The focus on regulatory issues leading to closure fits Group 2 well."
"Bull Run","{3: 0.965, 1: 0.035}","Perfect Match","Plant's retirement due to 'Environmental regulations and economic factors,' and to 'reduce emissions,' aligns perfectly with Group 3's primary driver of environmental regulations (often linked to health) and its secondary driver of economic difficulties from compliance."
"Genoa","{5: 1.0}","No Match","Plant retired at 52, so not a `young plant'. Although costs were a factor, it is not specifically stated that this is `renewable cost competition'. As such, the plant does not match the group's archetype."
"Chesterfield Power Station","{0: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Plant's aging infrastructure, state net-zero targets, and coal ash expenses directly match Group 0's primary and secondary drivers. The planned gas conversion also aligns."
"Somerset Operating Co LLC","{0: 1.0}","Close Match","Plant's aging infrastructure and associated economic factors/high maintenance costs align well with the 'Aging Infrastructure' aspect of Group 0's primary drivers. Lacks the explicit `Regulatory Non-Compliance' component."
"Pleasants Power Station","{4: 1.0}","Close Match","The retirement driver is a near-percect match to Group 4's drivers of High operational costs and economic pressures. However, this plant gets a Close Match and not a Perfect one as it is in WV and the profitability is not directly linked to renewable competition."
"Lewis Clark","{4: 0.96, 5: 0.04}","Perfect Match","The economic reason `Low-cost power available on the market' clearly implies the plant is comparatively expensive, aligning perfectly with Group 4's primary driver of high operating costs."
"W H Zimmer","{3: 1.0}","Partial Match","Plant's drivers are market dynamics, economic factors, and emissions reduction. Group 3 focuses on public health and environmental regulations. While emissions reduction is relevant, and economics can be a secondary factor, the stated primary drivers don't highlight specific health impacts or regulatory pressure due to health as the core reason."
"Boardman","{2: 1.0}","Perfect Match","The explicit driver of `environmental regulations' directly matches Group 2's primary driver of Political \\ Regulatory Pressure for Clean Energy Transitions."
"Wansley","{0: 1.0}","Close Match","Plant's utility-driven clean energy transition alligns well with Group 0's primary drivers, but lacks explicit mention of regulatory non-compliance, additionally stat (GA) has no clean energy targets. The plant was also subject to a natural gas conversion."
"Indiantown Cogeneration LP","{0: 0.975, 1: 0.025}","Close Match","Plant's aging infrastructure and associated economic factors/high maintenance costs align well with the `Aging Infrastructure' aspect of Group 0's primary drivers. Lacks the explicit 'Regulatory Non-Compliance' component."
"A B Brown Generating Station","{4: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Plant's retirement due to environmental regulations, economic factors, and emissions reduction aligns perfectly with Group 4's primary (high operating/retrofit costs due to regulations) and secondary drivers (utility/state targets)."
"R D Green","{5: 0.035, 0: 0.965}","Perfect Match","Plant's stated drivers of Coal Ash Violations and a natural gas conversion are a perfect match for Group 0's primary drivers."
"Birchwood Power","{0: 1.0}","Weak Match","Plant's driver is `inability to compete' (economic). Group 0's primary drivers are Aging Infrastructure \\ Regulatory Non-Compliance. While economic factors can be related, they are not the stated primary drivers for this group archetype, making it a weak match."
"H W Pirkey Power Plant","{4: 0.965, 5: 0.035}","Perfect Match","Retiring to `comply with new environmental regulations' directly implies that the cost of compliance (retrofits or ongoing) makes the plant expensive, aligning perfectly with Group 4's primary driver concerning environmental retrofit/compliance costs."
"Chalk Point Steam","{4: 1.0}","Perfect Match","Plant's retirement due to being `uneconomic and regulations' with 'unfavorable economics' is a perfect match for Group 4's primary drivers of high operating costs and environmental retrofit/compliance requirements."
"Cheswick Power Plant","{3: 1.0}","Weak Match","Plant drivers are `Not cost competitive' and `General Anti-Coal Sentiment.' Group 3's primary focus is public health and environmental regulations. While there could be indirect links (e.g., sentiment driven by health, or costs increased by regulations), the stated drivers don't directly align with Group 3's core archetype."
"Taconite Harbor Energy Center","{6: 0.93, 5: 0.07}","Perfect Match","Plant's retirement driven by emissions reductions, state climate goals, renewable mandates, and being uneconomic directly aligns with Group 6's primary (Political Opposition, Economic Difficulties) and secondary drivers."
