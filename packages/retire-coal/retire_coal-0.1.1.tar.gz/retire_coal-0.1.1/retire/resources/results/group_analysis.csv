Group,Name,Number of Plants,Percent of Capacity,Percent with Planned Retirement,Vulnerabilities,Barriers
0,Fuel Blend Plants,39,17.05,45.3,"Most plants burn alternative fuels, including natural gas, oil, and petroleum derivatives. Additionally, around 26% of plants primarily use alternative coal fuels such as waste coal and recycled coal. All plants are situated in grids heavily reliant on natural gas, and half of them are located in states with Democratic governors.","Plants are in counties with a significant swing in public opinion since 2018 towards favoring coal power, and 95% are in states with Republican legislatures."
1,Retrofitted but Vulnerable Plants,3,3.93,19.13,"Plants face challenges with low cash flows and high operational expenses, indicating reduced profitability. They are located in areas boasting abundant and much more affordable renewable energy alternatives, with solar LCOEs around half of coal. Furthermore, all plants are situated within 3 miles of highly disadvantaged communities.",Heavily invested in emissions control technology retrofits and younger than average (38 yrs).
2,Democratic Majority Plants,14,5.07,78.57,All plants are located in democratic majority states where the populace favors coal plant retitrements. The group boasts the highest percentage of plants with planned retirements (79% of plants and 90% of capacity),"Plants with the highest average cashflows and are younger (42 yrs), with the vast majority retiring around 50 years old. These plants have distinctly limited health impacts, and most are not located in disadvantaged communities."
3,High Health Impact Plants,29,28.81,50.26,"This group boasts high average SO2 emission rates (lb/mmBtu) and the highest PM2.5 emissions of any group, with the highest average respiratory-related hospital admits. The oldest coal plants of any group (45 yrs old on average), with roughly 50% planned for retirement.","Some of the most profitable plants (low forward and operational costs), all located in states with Republican legislatures."
4,Expensive Plants,74,29.18,25.78,"Highest average forward costs of all groups, 35% owned by entities having the most ambitious climate targets. Despite having a significant number of people living within 3 miles of coal plants, these are not situated in disadvantaged communities. Contributes the largest share of CO2 emissions, but maintains average CO2 emissions rates. However, above average NOx and SO2 emissions rates.","Of the 26% of plants that plan to retire, the average retirement age is notably old (60 years), while the average age of plants is currently only 40."
5,Young Plants,11,4.12,0.0,"These plants are situated in lower-income communities, except when compared to Group 1, and exhibit above-average CO2 emission rates. Furthermore, they are located in grids with an above-average reliance on wind power, where local wind potential costs are approximately half that of coal.","Plants average 32 years old (the youngest of any group) and have low criteria air pollutant emissions. Do not have many people living with 3 miles, nor an outsized impact on disadvantaged communities. Additionally, all fall on the higher profitability side of the spectrum."
6,Plants in Anti-Coal Regions,14,5.79,67.1,"Aging plants situated in counties overwhelmingly opposed to coal (63% of people), led by democratic governors and navigating complex legislative landscapes. These plants faced negative cashflows in 2020, regardless of relative profitability since 2012.","Located in counties that have seen the largest shift in pro-coal sentiment of all groups (+6.25% of people opposed to limiting coal CO2 emissions since 2018). Most have announced retirement plans (67% of plants and 71.5% of capacity), albeit at 60 years old."
7,Air Quality Offenders,6,2.91,0.0,"Second highest SO2 emissions and the highest criteria air pollutant emission rates, topping the charts for NOx, Mercury, and PM2.5 emissions. Second highest respiratory-related hospital admits.","Low forward costs and located in the highest pro-coal counties (60% opposed to limiting coal plant emissions) and with zero planned full or partial retirements. With the highest group-average capacity factor, only two plants are owned by entities with emissions reduction targets."
