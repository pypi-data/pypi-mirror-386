## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- `uv` package manager
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
- [Rootly API token](https://docs.rootly.com/api-reference/overview#how-to-generate-an-api-key%3F)

## Installation

Configure your MCP-compatible editor (tested with Cursor) with one of the configurations below. The package will be automatically downloaded and installed when you first open your editor.

### With uv

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rootly": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "--from",
        "rootly-mcp-server",
        "rootly-mcp-server"
      ],      
      "env": {
        "ROOTLY_API_TOKEN": "<YOUR_ROOTLY_API_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### With uvx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rootly": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "rootly-mcp-server",
        "rootly-mcp-server"
      ],      
      "env": {
        "ROOTLY_API_TOKEN": "<YOUR_ROOTLY_API_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To customize `allowed_paths` and access additional Rootly API paths, clone the repository and use this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rootly": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/rootly-mcp-server",
        "rootly-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ROOTLY_API_TOKEN": "<YOUR_ROOTLY_API_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connect to Hosted MCP Server

Alternatively, connect directly to our hosted MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rootly": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.rootly.com/sse",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${ROOTLY_AUTH_HEADER}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ROOTLY_AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer <YOUR_ROOTLY_API_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

- **Dynamic Tool Generation**: Automatically creates MCP resources from Rootly's OpenAPI (Swagger) specification
- **Smart Pagination**: Defaults to 10 items per request for incident endpoints to prevent context window overflow
- **API Filtering**: Limits exposed API endpoints for security and performance
- **Intelligent Incident Analysis**: Smart tools that analyze historical incident data
  - **`find_related_incidents`**: Uses TF-IDF similarity analysis to find historically similar incidents  
  - **`suggest_solutions`**: Mines past incident resolutions to recommend actionable solutions
- **MCP Resources**: Exposes incident and team data as structured resources for easy AI reference
- **Intelligent Pattern Recognition**: Automatically identifies services, error types, and resolution patterns

### Why Path Limiting?

We limit exposed API paths for two key reasons:

1. **Context Management**: Rootly's comprehensive API can overwhelm AI agents, affecting their ability to perform simple tasks effectively
2. **Security**: Controls which information and actions are accessible through the MCP server

To expose additional paths, modify the `allowed_paths` variable in `src/rootly_mcp_server/server.py`.

### Smart Analysis Tools

The MCP server includes intelligent tools that analyze historical incident data to provide actionable insights:

#### `find_related_incidents`
Finds historically similar incidents using text similarity analysis:
```
find_related_incidents(incident_id="12345", similarity_threshold=0.15, max_results=5)
```
- **Input**: Incident ID, similarity threshold (0.0-1.0), max results
- **Output**: Similar incidents with confidence scores, matched services, and resolution times
- **Use Case**: Get context from past incidents to understand patterns and solutions

#### `suggest_solutions` 
Recommends solutions by analyzing how similar incidents were resolved:
```
suggest_solutions(incident_id="12345", max_solutions=3)
# OR for new incidents:
suggest_solutions(incident_title="Payment API errors", incident_description="Users getting 500 errors during checkout")
```
- **Input**: Either incident ID OR title/description text
- **Output**: Actionable solution recommendations with confidence scores and time estimates  
- **Use Case**: Get intelligent suggestions based on successful past resolutions

#### How It Works
- **Text Similarity**: Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity (scikit-learn)
- **Service Detection**: Automatically identifies affected services from incident text
- **Pattern Recognition**: Finds common error types, resolution patterns, and time estimates
- **Fallback Mode**: Works without ML libraries using keyword-based similarity
- **Solution Mining**: Extracts actionable steps from resolution summaries

#### Data Requirements
For optimal results, ensure your Rootly incidents have descriptive:
- **Titles**: Clear, specific incident descriptions
- **Summaries**: Detailed resolution steps when closing incidents
- **Service Tags**: Proper service identification

Example good resolution summary: `"Restarted auth-service, cleared Redis cache, and increased connection pool from 10 to 50"`

### On-Call Shift Metrics

Get on-call shift metrics for any time period, grouped by user, team, or schedule. Includes primary/secondary role tracking, shift counts, hours, and days on-call.

```
get_oncall_shift_metrics(
    start_date="2025-10-01",
    end_date="2025-10-31",
    group_by="user"
)
```

### On-Call Handoff Summary

Complete handoff: current/next on-call + incidents during shifts.

```python
# All on-call (any timezone)
get_oncall_handoff_summary(
    team_ids="team-1,team-2",
    timezone="America/Los_Angeles"
)

# Regional filter - only show APAC on-call during APAC business hours
get_oncall_handoff_summary(
    timezone="Asia/Tokyo",
    filter_by_region=True
)
```

Regional filtering shows only people on-call during business hours (9am-5pm) in the specified timezone.

Returns: `schedules` with `current_oncall`, `next_oncall`, and `shift_incidents`

### Shift Incidents

Incidents during a time period, with filtering by severity/status/tags.

```python
get_shift_incidents(
    start_time="2025-10-20T09:00:00Z",
    end_time="2025-10-20T17:00:00Z",
    severity="critical",  # optional
    status="resolved",    # optional
    tags="database,api"   # optional
)
```

Returns: `incidents` list + `summary` (counts, avg resolution time, grouping)

## Developer Setup & Troubleshooting

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management

### 1. Set Up Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Always activate before running scripts
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all project dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install .
```

To add new dependencies during development:
```bash
uv pip install <package>
```

### 3. Set Up Git Hooks (Recommended for Contributors)

Install pre-commit hooks to automatically run linting and tests before commits:

```bash
./scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

This ensures code quality by running:
- Ruff linting
- Pyright type checking
- Unit tests

### 4. Verify Installation

The server should now be ready to use with your MCP-compatible editor.

**For developers:** Additional testing tools are available in the `tests/` directory.
