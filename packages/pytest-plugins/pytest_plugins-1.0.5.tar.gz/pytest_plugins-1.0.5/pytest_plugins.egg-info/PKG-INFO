generate `execution_results.json`, `test_results.json`, and `test_report`.md under `tests/results_output/` directory.
  - flags:
    - `--better-report`: Enable the better report feature.
    - `--output-dir`: Specify the output directory for the report files (default is `root_project/results_output/`).
    - `--traceback`: Include detailed traceback information in the report.
    - `--md-report`: Generate a Markdown report of the test results.
    - `repo-name`: Specify the git repository name for the report.
    - `--pr-number`: Include a pull request number in the report for better traceability.
    - `--mr-number`: Include a merge request number in the report for better traceability.
    - `--pipeline-number`: Include a CI pipeline number in the report for better traceability.
    - `--commit`: Include the commit hash in the report for better traceability.
    - `--add-parameters`: Add the test parameters as fields to the test results.
    - `--pytest-command`: Add the detailed information about the pytest command-line to the "execution_results.json" file
<br> <br>
- ✅ **maxfail-streak**: Stop test execution after a configurable number of consecutive failures.
    - flags:
      - `--maxfail-streak=N`: Stop test execution after `N` consecutive failures.
<br> <br>
- ✅ **fail2skip**: Change failing tests to skipped, allowing for better test management and reporting.
- flags:
  - `--fail2skip`: Enable the fail2skip feature.
    - `@pytest.mark.fail2skip`: Decorator to mark tests that should be skipped on failure.
<br> <br>
- ✅ **verbose-param-ids**: Enhance test IDs with parameter names for better clarity in pytest reports.
- flags:
    - `--verbose-param-ids`: Include parameter names in pytest test IDs (e.g., `(param1: value1, param2: value2)` instead of `(param1-param2))`
