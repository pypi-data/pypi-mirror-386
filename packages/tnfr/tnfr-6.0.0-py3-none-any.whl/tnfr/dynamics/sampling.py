    The sample is limited by ``UM_CANDIDATE_COUNT`` and refreshed every
    simulation step. When the network is small (``< 50`` nodes) or the limit
    is nonâ€‘positive, the full node set is used and sampling is effectively
    disabled. A snapshot of nodes is cached via the NodeCache helper from
    ``tnfr.utils`` stored in
    ``G.graph['_node_list_cache']`` and reused across steps; it is only refreshed
    when the graph size changes. Sampling operates directly on the cached
    tuple of nodes.
