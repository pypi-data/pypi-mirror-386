"""
This is the nodes module, in which we have
all the classes that make the concept work.

This module is specific to process with CPU.

Note for the developer:
- Make sure you use 'f1' dtype with [0, 255]
values (np.uint8) for the inputs, using the
float precission sometimes but always reutrning
those inputs for the textures are those are 
the ones we can handle with our OpenGL system.
