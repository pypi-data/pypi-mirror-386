## Version 0.6.2

This release includes several improvements to the caching mechanism, new features for testing, and a version bump.

### New Features

- Implemented caching mechanism across various bot components, including QueryBot, SimpleBot, and StructuredBot. Added a new cache module and updated dependencies to include diskcache. (b7d2b32, Eric Ma)
- Added deterministic mock response generation for tests. Imported hashlib to use for generating hash-based mock responses and created a new function generate\_mock\_response to produce unique responses. (4a49925, Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- Improved caching mechanism in SimpleBot methods by adding ignore={0} to @cache.memoize() in key methods to ignore "self" positional arg. (621e8e9, Eric Ma)

### Refactoring

- Refactored caching in SimpleBot methods, removing caching from stream\_panel and stream\_api methods and adding caching to generate\_response method. (f35bab2, Eric Ma)
- Refactored caching in bot classes, removing redundant caching decorators from QueryBot and StructuredBot and adding caching to various stream methods in SimpleBot to optimize performance. (282efbc, Eric Ma)
- Refactored test\_simple\_bot\_stream\_stdout to use hypothesis strategies more efficiently, replacing multiple given decorators with a single one using st.data() and using st.tuples to draw system\_prompt, human\_message, and mock\_response together. (8b56779, Eric Ma)

### Deprecations

- None in this release.
