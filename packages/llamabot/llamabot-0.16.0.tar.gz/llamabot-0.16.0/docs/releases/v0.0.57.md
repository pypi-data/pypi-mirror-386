## 0.0.57

This new version introduces several enhancements to the QueryBot class, adds a language inference function to the `embed_repo.ipynb` notebook, and provides a command line interface for interacting with a code repository. It also includes progress bars for file hashing and document splitting processes, an option to ignore directories when displaying the directory tree, and support for multiple documents for indexing. Lastly, a comprehensive tutorial on how to install, configure, and use LlamaBot is added.

### New Features

- Added caching option and improved document handling in QueryBot. This includes changes to the `make_or_load_index` function, `exit_if_asked` function, `ZOTERO_JSON_DIR`, `ZoteroLibrary` class, and `magic_load_doc` function. Also, updates were made to the `zotero.ipynb` notebook to reflect these changes (579f162) (Eric Ma)
- Added language inference function and updated execution counts in `embed_repo.ipynb` notebook. This enhances the functionality of the notebook by allowing it to infer the programming languages used in a repository and providing a more detailed view of the repository's structure (b795e72) (Eric Ma)
- Added CLI for interacting with code repository. This is part of ongoing efforts to improve the usability of the LlamaBot project (042ae26) (Eric Ma)
- Added progress bars to file hashing and document splitting in the QueryBot module. This provides a visual indication of progress when processing large numbers of documents, improving user experience (4634185) (Eric Ma)
- Added directory ignore option to `show_directory_tree`. This allows specifying a list of directory names to ignore when displaying the directory tree (271ccde) (Eric Ma)
- Added support for multiple documents for indexing in QueryBot. This includes changes to the `doc_paths` parameter and the `make_or_load_index` function (c813522) (Eric Ma)
- Added LlamaBot tutorial documentation. This provides a comprehensive tutorial on how to install, configure, and use LlamaBot (9e25fb5) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- No bug fixes in this release.

### Deprecations

- The change in how Zotero library data is stored and handled may break existing code that relies on the old JSONL format (579f162) (Eric Ma)
