## 0.0.34

This version introduces several new features and improvements to the LlamaBot CLI, including the addition of git diff display and commit message generation, a __repr__ method for the Dummy class, and handling for no staged changes in commit_message. It also includes several refactors and a documentation update.

### New Features

- Added git diff display and commit message generation functionality to the LlamaBot CLI. This feature imports the get_git_diff function from llamabot.code_manipulation, creates a SimpleBot instance for commit message generation, defines a commit_message function with a text.prompt decorator, and calls commitbot with the generated commit message.

- Added a __repr__ method to the Dummy class in dummy.py. This provides a string representation of the object, making it easier to inspect and debug instances of the Dummy class. (ae3e7c) (Eric Ma)
- Updated commit_message function in cli/git.py to check for staged changes before generating a commit message. If no staged changes are found, a message is printed and the function returns. The get_git_diff function in code_manipulation.py was also updated to return an empty string if there are no staged changes. (ed7a3d) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed typos in the llamabot CLI git module. Changes include renaming `git.app` to `git.gitapp` in llamabot/cli/__init__.py, adding missing parentheses to decorators in llamabot/cli/git.py, and replacing "docstring" with "commit message" in the user prompt. (860930) (Eric Ma)
- Refactored Typer app and command decorators in git.py. The `app` was renamed to `gitapp` for better context, and decorators were updated to use the new `gitapp` variable. (f7af8b) (Eric Ma)

### Deprecations

- Removed the unnecessary hello command from the git.py file in the llamabot CLI. This simplifies the codebase and focuses on the core functionality. (8f0b9d) (Eric Ma)

### Documentation

- Added a detailed explanation of the Conventional Commits specification to the git.py file. This outlines the various commit types, scopes, and footers, as well as their correlation with Semantic Versioning. This information will help users understand the importance of following the Conventional Commits specification when crafting their commit messages. (ca9b1c) (Eric Ma)
