## Version 0.0.78

This new version includes several improvements to the release workflow and bug fixes. The release notes handling has been updated and simplified, and several bugs in the GitHub Actions workflow have been fixed.

### New Features

- Release notes handling in the GitHub workflow has been updated. The workflow now copies the release notes to a temporary location before creating a release in the GitHub repository. This ensures that the release notes are correctly included in the release (d9ab5b) (Eric Ma)
- The source of the release notes in the GitHub Actions workflow for releasing a Python package has been changed. Instead of using an environment variable, it now reads from a markdown file in the docs/releases directory. The filename is based on the version number (3958ff) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- A bug in the GitHub Actions workflow for releasing a Python package has been fixed. The copy command used to copy the release notes was incorrect and has been fixed (7cda28) (Eric Ma)
- The file path for the release notes in the release-python-package GitHub workflow has been corrected. The version number now correctly includes a 'v' prefix when reading the markdown file (e03626) (Eric Ma)
- The path for the release notes in the GitHub Actions workflow has been corrected. The previous path was causing issues in the workflow execution. The path has been updated to correctly point to the release notes file (75978b) (Eric Ma)

### Deprecations

- The step of copying release notes to a temporary location has been removed and the original file is directly referenced in the release action. This simplifies the workflow and reduces unnecessary operations (eb2aef) (Eric Ma)
