## Version 0.13.4

This release includes significant improvements in docstring parsing and function metadata extraction, enhancing performance and compatibility with various docstring styles.

### New Features

- Introduced `function_to_dict` and `parse_docstring` utilities to enhance function metadata extraction, supporting numpy, google, and sphinx-style docstrings. This feature allows for better integration with OpenAI function calling by using docstring parsing and type annotations. (609097) (Eric Ma)
- Added comprehensive tests for the new `parse_docstring` utility to ensure graceful handling of malformed and long descriptions across different docstring styles. (7cf220) (Eric Ma)
- Refactored docstring parsing in the `llamabot.components.tools` to use pre-compiled regex patterns, improving performance and readability while enhancing parameter parsing flexibility. (68fd2f) (Eric Ma)
- Major refactor of docstring parsing to utilize the `docstring-parser` library, replacing custom regex-based parsing. This update simplifies the type extraction logic and improves handling of optional parameters, ensuring better compatibility and maintainability. (ac93d5) (Eric Ma)
