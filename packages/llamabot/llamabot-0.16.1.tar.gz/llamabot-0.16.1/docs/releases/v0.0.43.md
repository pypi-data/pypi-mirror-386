## Version 0.0.43

This new version includes several enhancements to the code workflow and code manipulation features, as well as an update to the default model_name in various bot classes.

### New Features

- Added new code cells and autoreload in code_workflow.ipynb. This includes the addition of new empty code cells for future implementation, a placeholder in one of the cells, autoreload magic commands for a better development experience, and the importation and demonstration of the get_dependencies function usage (5f6880) (Eric Ma)
- Introduced the get_dependencies function to retrieve a list of dependencies for a specified object in a source file. Also fixed the return type annotation for the get_git_diff function and added a test case for the get_dependencies function in test_code_manipulation.py (2d816f) (Eric Ma)
- Updated the default model_name parameter value from "gpt-4" to "gpt-4-32k" in the constructors of ChatBot, QueryBot, and SimpleBot classes (c93ba3) (Eric Ma)
