## 0.0.67

This new version introduces enhancements to the social media post generation, updates to the testing matrix for Python versions, and a new GitHub workflow for daily testing of PyPI packages.

### New Features

- Enhanced social media post generation. The update refactors the social media content generation to handle different platforms more effectively, adds JSON schema to standardize the return format, improves the handling of Patreon posts, and copies the post text to the clipboard for platforms other than Patreon.

- Introduced a new GitHub workflow for daily testing of PyPI packages. The workflow runs on the main branch and uses a matrix strategy to test on Python versions 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11. (fce17c) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- Updated the python versions used in the test-pypi-package workflow. The versions have been updated from 3.10 to 3.10.12 and from 3.11 to 3.11.4. This ensures that the package is tested against the latest patch versions of Python. (e9ec8d) (Eric Ma)

### Deprecations

- Removed Python version 3.12 from the testing matrix in the GitHub Actions workflow for testing the PyPI package. This change is made to focus on the more stable and widely used versions of Python. (b90b8c) (Eric Ma)
- Updated the python versions used in the testing matrix of the test-pypi-package workflow. The version 3.9 has been removed and version 3.12 has been added. This ensures our package remains compatible with the latest python versions. (70e4dc) (Eric Ma)
