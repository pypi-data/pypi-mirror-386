## Version 0.4.1

This release includes several improvements to the CLI tool's performance, test coverage, and code maintainability.

### New Features

- Expanded model names list and increased default query results: Added `command-r` and `mxbai-embed-large` to the model names list, and increased the default number of query results from 10 to 20 for better performance and more relevant search results. (1389534, Eric Ma)

### Improvements

- Improved CLI tool execution time test: Introduced a new test case to measure the execution time of the llamabot CLI tool and ensured it does not exceed a predefined threshold (2 seconds) to maintain performance expectations. (09f776e, Eric Ma)
- Adjusted CLI tool execution time threshold: Increased the execution time assertion from 2.0 seconds to 3.0 seconds to accommodate changes in the CLI tool's performance characteristics and ensure reliable tests under varying execution conditions. (ca0d353, Eric Ma)
- Simplified `test_call_in_jupyter` with patching: Replaced `mocker` usage with `unittest.mock.patch` for consistency and clarity, utilized `MagicMock` directly for mocking responses, and streamlined the test by removing redundant setup and assertions. (ee29c25, Eric Ma)
- Optimized import statements: Moved imports to function scope in `imagebot.py` and `docstore.py` to improve import efficiency and potentially reduce the initial load time of the modules. (d4e5920, Eric Ma)
- Streamlined embedding and schema definition: Replaced `Optional` type import with `Callable`, removed `DocstoreEntry` class from global scope, integrated its definition within `LanceDBDocStore` constructor, and simplified embedding function retrieval. (7621520, Eric Ma)

### Code Maintenance and Optimization

- Bumped version to 0.4.1: Updated the version number to 0.4.1 using GitHub Actions. (6b1df0c, github-actions)
- Merged pull request #50: Incorporated changes from the `improve-cli-timing` branch. (e24911a, Eric Ma)
- Optimized imports and removed debug logs: Moved `openai.OpenAI` import to `ImageBot` constructor, removed unused `loguru.logger` imports and related debug log statements, and encapsulated `lancedb.embeddings.get_registry` import within `DocstoreEntry` constructor. (f158ddd, Eric Ma)
- Optimized imports and dynamic loading: Removed unused imports, implemented dynamic import loading for `panel`, `pandas`, `chromadb`, and `lancedb`, and adjusted the scope of import statements to function-level where applicable. (2339555, Eric Ma)
- Ensured newline at end of v0.4.0 release notes: Added a newline at the end of the v0.4.0 release notes file to ensure compliance with POSIX standards and improve compatibility with various text processing tools. (b9bd9c5, Eric Ma)
