## 0.0.55

This new version introduces a chat command to LlamaBot CLI, adds a logging option to the ChatBot class, and updates the documentation with new usage examples and a CLI demos section.

### New Features

- Added a chat command to LlamaBot CLI. This new command allows users to interact with the ChatBot and includes an option to save the chat to a markdown file. The filename for the saved chat is generated based on the current date and time. The chat command will exit if the user types "exit" or "quit". (baa4d64) (Eric Ma)
- Added a logging option to the ChatBot class. This new parameter is a boolean that determines whether to log the chat history and token budget. This feature provides more flexibility for users who want to monitor the chat history and token budget during the bot operation. (6550cf3) (Eric Ma)
- Updated the documentation's index file with new usage examples. These include a new example of exposing a chatbot directly at the command line using `llamabot chat`, an updated description and command for using `llamabot` as part of the backend of a CLI app to chat with Zotero library, and a new example of using `llamabot`'s `SimpleBot` to create a bot that automatically writes commit messages.

- Introduced a new section in the documentation, specifically in the index.md file. The section is titled "CLI Demos" and provides examples of what can be built with Llamabot and some supporting code. It also includes an embedded asciicast for a more interactive demonstration. (ce7e734) (Eric Ma)
- Added an asciicast script to the documentation index file. This will provide users with a visual guide or tutorial. (e332f0a) (Eric Ma)
