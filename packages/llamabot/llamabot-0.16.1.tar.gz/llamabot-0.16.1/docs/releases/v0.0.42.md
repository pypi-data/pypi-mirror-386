## Version 0.0.42

This new version introduces an enhancement to the get_valid_input function and a new feature that allows users to manually edit the generated commit message using their system's default text editor.

### New Features

- Manual commit message editing option has been added. Users can now manually edit the generated commit message using their system's default text editor. This is done by creating a temporary file with the generated message, opening it in the editor, and reading the edited message back into the script. The 'm' option is added to the user input prompt to trigger manual editing. (37baea) (Eric Ma)

### Enhancements

- The get_valid_input function in cli/utils has been refactored for better input validation. A valid_inputs parameter has been added to the function, the input prompt has been updated to include valid_inputs, and the input validation now checks against valid_inputs. The error message has also been updated to display valid_inputs options. (b32986) (Eric Ma)
