## Version 0.11.1

This minor release includes a series of refactoring improvements aimed at optimizing import handling across various modules, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and performance.

### New Features

- Refactored import statement for `pyzotero` to only occur within the `load_zotero` function to reduce unnecessary loading (d6b415) (Eric Ma)
- Improved import handling and initialization of the progress bar in the zotero library for better performance and clarity (ebfedb) (Eric Ma)
- Reorganized import statements and error handling in `zotero.py` to enhance code readability and reduce global try-except blocks (264e61) (Eric Ma)
- Optimized import handling for `prompt_toolkit` in CLI utilities to decrease initial load time and minimize import errors (751c06) (Eric Ma)
- Moved `pyperclip` import within functions to optimize module loading and reduce initial script load time (144cec) (Eric Ma)
- Relocated `nbformat` import to function scope to improve module's initial load time and avoid unnecessary imports (80a8c3) (Eric Ma)
- Refactored import error handling for `pyperclip` and `git` modules to specific functions, ensuring error messages are contextually relevant (464615) (Eric Ma)
- Reorganized CLI imports and spacing in the save method to adhere to PEP 8 and improve readability (194da5) (Eric Ma)
- Moved the import of `prompt_toolkit` to within the `default_model` function to reduce initial load time (673e91) (Eric Ma)
- Relocated `pyperclip` import to specific functions to optimize module loading and improve startup performance (bd57b2) (Eric Ma)
- Refactored import checks to be function-local in `code_manipulation` for better modularity and streamlined module initialization (7eb94c) (Eric Ma)
