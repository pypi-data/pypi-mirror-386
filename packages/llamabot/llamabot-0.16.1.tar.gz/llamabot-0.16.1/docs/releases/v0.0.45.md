### Refactors

- The default value of the `repo_path` parameter in the `get_git_diff` function has been changed from `here()` to `None`. Additionally, a conditional check has been added to set `repo_path` to `here()` if it is `None`. This change makes the function more flexible and easier to use. (96e69b) (Eric Ma)
