# File Handling in Python: A Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will explore a module that provides functions for file handling in Python. The module contains three main functions:

1. `recursive_find(root_dir: Path, file_extension: str) -> List[Path]`: Find all files in a given path with a given extension.
2. `check_in_git_repo(path) -> bool`: Check if a given path is in a git repository.
3. `read_file(path: Path) -> str`: Read a file.

Let's dive into each function and see how they can be used.

## 1. Finding Files Recursively

The `recursive_find` function allows you to find all files with a specific extension within a given directory and its subdirectories. This can be useful when you want to process all files of a certain type in a project.

### Usage

To use the `recursive_find` function, you need to provide two arguments:

- `root_dir`: The directory in which to search for files.
- `file_extension`: The file extension to search for. For example, use ".py" for Python files, not "py".

Here's an example of how to use the `recursive_find` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from llamabot.file_finder import recursive_find

root_directory = Path("path/to/your/directory")
file_extension = ".py"

python_files = recursive_find(root_directory, file_extension)
print(python_files)
```

This will output a list of `Path` objects representing all the Python files found in the specified directory and its subdirectories.

## 2. Checking if a Path is in a Git Repository

The `check_in_git_repo` function allows you to check if a given path is part of a git repository. This can be useful when you want to ensure that your code is only executed within a version-controlled environment.

### Usage

To use the `check_in_git_repo` function, you need to provide one argument:

- `path`: The path to check.

Here's an example of how to use the `check_in_git_repo` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from llamabot.file_finder import check_in_git_repo

path_to_check = Path("path/to/your/directory")

is_in_git_repo = check_in_git_repo(path_to_check)
print(is_in_git_repo)
```

This will output `True` if the specified path is part of a git repository, and `False` otherwise.

## 3. Reading a File

The `read_file` function allows you to read the contents of a file. This can be useful when you want to process the contents of a file, such as analyzing code or parsing data.

### Usage

To use the `read_file` function, you need to provide one argument:

- `path`: The path to the file to be read.

Here's an example of how to use the `read_file` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from llamabot.file_finder import read_file

file_path = Path("path/to/your/file.txt")

file_contents = read_file(file_path)
print(file_contents)
```

This will output the contents of the specified file.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored a module that provides functions for file handling in Python. By using these functions, you can easily find files with specific extensions, check if a path is part of a git repository, and read the contents of a file. These functions can be combined to create powerful file processing pipelines in your Python projects.
