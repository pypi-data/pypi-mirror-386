## Version 0.1.0

This release includes several new features, bug fixes, and improvements to the codebase.

### New Features

- **Update default language model to Mistral and remove OpenAI API key warning** (e74954b) (Eric Ma): The default language model used by the `SimpleBot` class has been updated to Mistral, which is a more cost-effective option compared to the previously used gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 model. The OpenAI API key warning has also been removed, as the Mistral model does not require an API key.
- **Add API key support for QABot and SimpleBot** (b5f8253) (Eric Ma): This commit adds support for providing API keys to the QABot and SimpleBot classes, allowing for secure access to external services. This enhancement improves the security and flexibility of the bot's functionality.
- **Update default language model environment variable** (4bfd362) (Eric Ma): The default language model environment variable has been updated from `OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL` to `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_MODEL` to align with the changes in the codebase.
- **Update default language model to gpt-3.5-turbo-1106** (c8f0893) (Eric Ma): The default language model used by the commitbot has been updated to "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106" for improved performance and cost efficiency.
- **Add logging for API key usage** (3be39ad) (Eric Ma): Logging has been added to SimpleBot to log the usage of the API key for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- **Add model\_name parameter to SimpleBot instance** (6a78332) (Eric Ma): A new parameter, model\_name, has been added to the SimpleBot instance in the llamabot/cli/git.py file. The model\_name is set to "mistral/mistral-medium". This change allows for more flexibility and customization when using the SimpleBot.
- **Add new model name to ollama\_model\_names.txt** (3110dc9) (Eric Ma): 'megadolphin' has been added to the list of model names in ollama\_model\_names.txt.
- **Add new model name and refactor test\_docstore** (17352b8) (Eric Ma): 'llama-pro' has been added to ollama\_model\_names.txt and the test\_docstore function has been refactored to remove unused imports and the make\_fake\_document function.
- **Add Knowledge Graph bot** (963cd63) (Eric Ma): A new feature has been added to the codebase, the Knowledge Graph bot (KGBot). The KGBot takes in a chunk of text and returns a JSON of triplets. It is tested with mistral-medium and uses the default language model. The bot is called with a query and returns a JSON of triplets.
- **Add QABot class to llamabot** (21197c1) (Eric Ma): A new class, DocQABot, has been added to the qabot.py file. This bot is designed to use pre-computed questions and answers to generate a response. It includes methods for adding documents for the bot to query and for calling the QABot. This enhancement will improve the bot's ability to generate responses based on the provided documents.
- **Add DocumentStore class for LlamaBot** (117baf7) (Eric Ma): A new feature has been added to the codebase, a DocumentStore class for LlamaBot. This class wraps around ChromaDB and provides methods to append and retrieve documents from the store. The DocumentStore class is defined in the newly created file llamabot/components/docstore.py.
- **Add top-level API for llamabot's components** (b2cf9f0) (Eric Ma): A new file, \_\_init\_\_.py, has been added which serves as the top-level API for llamabot's components.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix logging of API key** (932beec) (Eric Ma): The commit fixes the logging of the API key in the SimpleBot class to display the complete key instead of just the first 5 characters. This change improves the clarity and security of the logging information.
- **Fix environment variable retrieval in write\_release\_notes function** (c627b18) (Eric Ma): This commit fixes an issue where the environment variable was not being retrieved correctly in the write\_release\_notes function.
- **Fix stream parameter not being passed to bot function** (185f2bc) (Eric Ma): This commit fixes an issue where the stream parameter was not being passed to the bot function in the cli/git module.

### Deprecations

- None in this release.
