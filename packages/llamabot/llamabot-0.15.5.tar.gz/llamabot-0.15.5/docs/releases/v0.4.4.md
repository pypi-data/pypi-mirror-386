## Version 0.4.4

This release includes several enhancements to the Docker deployments and command-line interface for the chat service.

### New Features

- The base Docker image has been switched to `python:3.10-slim` and environment variables have been introduced for more flexible configuration. Dependencies are now installed directly via `pip` and `curl`. The `llamabot` CLI and `ChatUIMixin` have been updated to support custom host and port configurations. (43fe652) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

No bug fixes were included in this release.

### Deprecations

- The use of the `condaforge/mambaforge` base Docker image has been deprecated in favor of `python:3.10-slim`. The default port has also been changed to `6363`. These changes may require updates to existing deployment configurations. (43fe652) (Eric Ma)
