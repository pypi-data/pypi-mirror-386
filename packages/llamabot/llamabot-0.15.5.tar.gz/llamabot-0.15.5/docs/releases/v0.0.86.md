## Version 0.0.86

This version includes several enhancements and updates to the codebase, including the addition of new tutorials, refactoring of the code, and updates to the Python version used in the GitHub Actions workflow.

### New Features

- Added a tutorial for building a QueryBot chat interface with file upload functionality. This tutorial guides users on how to build a chat interface using the QueryBot and Panel libraries. (4b5799a) (Eric Ma)
- Introduced a new tutorial in the documentation that guides users on how to create a simple chat interface using the `SimpleBot` class from the `llamabot` library and the `Panel` library. (efaef316) (Eric Ma)
- Introduced a new Jupyter notebook 'panel-chat.ipynb' in the 'scratch_notebooks' directory. The notebook includes code for setting up a chat interface using the Panel library, and integrating it with a chatbot for interactive responses. (ba5d8009) (Eric Ma)
- Introduced a new Jupyter notebook 'zotero-panel.ipynb' in the 'scratch_notebooks' directory. The notebook contains code for creating a Zotero panel with interactive widgets for configuring Zotero API key, library ID, and library type. (8f477ec6) (Eric Ma)
- Introduced a new instance of SimpleBot named 'feynman' to the ollama notebook. The bot is tasked with explaining complex concepts, specifically in this case, the challenge of enzyme function annotation and the introduction of a machine learning algorithm named CLEAN. (7f844dca) (Eric Ma)
- Added ".html": "UnstructuredReader" to EXTENSION_LOADER_MAPPING in doc_processor.py to enable processing of .html files. (45d6485c) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- Updated the python version used in the GitHub workflow for code style checks to 3.11. (d10e7e18) (Eric Ma)

### Refactor

- Removed unused imports from `querybot.py` and updated `make_or_load_vector_index` function to take `service_context` as a parameter instead of creating it within the function. (935e3dad) (Eric Ma)
- Removed the unused @validate_call decorator from the __call__ method in querybot.py. (3f7e8c0b) (Eric Ma)

### Documentation

- Added instructions to the documentation on how to use local Ollama models with LlamaBot. It includes a Python code snippet demonstrating how to specify the `model_name` keyword argument when creating a `SimpleBot` instance. (57f12809) (Eric Ma)
- Updated the documentation for LlamaBot. It introduces two options for getting access to language models: using local models with Ollama or using the OpenAI API. (fc42049c) (Eric Ma)

### Chore

- Updated the versions of pre-commit hooks for pre-commit-hooks, black, and ruff-pre-commit. It also replaces the darglint hook with pydoclint for better documentation linting. (9cc49022) (Eric Ma)
