## Version 0.0.75

This new version includes several enhancements to the CLI module of LlamaBot. The improvements focus on automating the process of writing commit messages and ensuring consistency. The version also includes codebase improvements such as the removal of unnecessary comments.

### New Features

This command automatically generates a commit message based on the diff and writes it to the `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` file. Error handling has also been included in case any exceptions occur during the process. (185613) (Eric Ma)
