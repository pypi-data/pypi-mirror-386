## Version 0.4.6

This release includes a new feature that allows users to choose between receiving the URL of the generated image or saving the image locally when using the `ImageBot` class. Additionally, there is a fix for test readability and alignment with the expected use of the `bot` function parameters.

### New Features

- Added a `return_url` parameter to the `ImageBot` class to allow users to choose between receiving the URL of the generated image or saving the image locally. This change also includes an updated call signature and logic for handling the new parameter, as well as a new Jupyter notebook workflow for generating banner images based on blog post summaries.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue in the tests where the `bot` function call in `test_call_outside_jupyter` was not using the named parameter `save_path` for clarity and to match function signature expectations. This change improves test readability and aligns with the expected use of the `bot` function parameters. (18f1095, Eric Ma)
