## Version 0.9.19

This release includes significant refactoring improvements to the LlamaBot, enhancing the setup of logging and database paths. These changes streamline the codebase and improve the maintainability of the system.

### New Features

- Centralized the database path resolution logic to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability. This update ensures that all modules uniformly manage database paths through a single utility function, enhancing the code's cleanliness and reducing potential errors. (0ece15b) (Eric Ma)
