## Version 0.0.89

This version includes several refactoring changes, new features, and documentation updates. The main focus of this release was to improve the code organization and efficiency, and to update the usage of the OpenAI API.

### New Features

- Added a new test for the ImageBot class in the llamabot library. The test checks the behavior of the call method when it is invoked outside of a Jupyter notebook and no save path is provided. (0e23857) (Eric Ma)
- Introduced a new Jupyter notebook under the docs/examples directory. The notebook demonstrates how to use the ImageBot API to generate images from text using the OpenAI API. (8779040) (Eric Ma)
- Added ImageBot class to bot module for generating images based on prompts. (7174058) (Eric Ma)
- Increased the default token budget from 2048 to 4096 and added token budget for the new "mistral" model. (7f13698) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the cache-downloads-key in the pr-tests.yaml workflow file. The key now includes a hash of the 'environment.yml' file to ensure cache is updated when the environment changes. (1c12ff5) (Eric Ma)

### Refactors

- Moved the initialization of the OpenAI client into the `default_model` function. (bd50b90) (Eric Ma)
- Removed the direct access to the environment variable for the OpenAI API key in the client initialization. (7cb3d09) (Eric Ma)
- Changed the way model list attributes are accessed in the configure.py file of the llamabot CLI. (4deb93f) (Eric Ma)
- Extracted the filename generation logic, which was previously inside the ImageBot class, to a separate function named filename_bot. (aec4f3c) (Eric Ma)
- Removed direct assignment of OpenAI API key in __init__.py and replaced direct model list retrieval from OpenAI with client's model list method. (66fbcec) (Eric Ma)

### Documentation

- Updated the docstring for the filename_bot function in the imagebot.py file. The updated docstring now includes parameter and return value descriptions. (c5dd51d) (Eric Ma)

### Dependencies

- Updated the micromamba version from '1.4.5-0' to '1.5.1-2' in the pr-tests.yaml workflow. (6341f35) (Eric Ma)
- Updated dependencies versions including llama_index and langchain in environment.yml and pyproject.toml. (e9229cc) (Eric Ma)

### Tests

- Removed the deadline for the test_codebot_instance function in the python_prompt_library test suite to prevent potential timeout issues. (4a30e96) (Eric Ma)
- Removed the deadline for the simple bot initialization test to prevent false negatives due to time constraints. (16ee108) (Eric Ma)
