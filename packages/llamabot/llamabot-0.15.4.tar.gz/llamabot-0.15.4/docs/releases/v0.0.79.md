## Version 0.0.79

This version introduces a new prompt decorator and tests, improves the release workflow, fixes bugs in the GitHub Actions workflow, and removes the dependency on the 'outlines' package.

### New Features

- A new prompt decorator has been added in the scratch_notebooks directory, enhancing the functionality of functions by adding a prompt feature. Tests have been included to ensure the decorator works as expected with different types of function arguments (d023f22) (Eric Ma).
- Tests for blogging prompts in the prompt_library directory have been added. These tests validate the output of different blogging prompt functions (d023f22) (Eric Ma).
- The release notes handling in the GitHub workflow has been updated. The workflow now copies the release notes to a temporary location before creating a release in the GitHub repository (3884962) (Eric Ma).
- The source of the release notes in the GitHub Actions workflow for releasing a Python package has been changed. It now reads from a markdown file in the docs/releases directory (3884962) (Eric Ma).
- The file path for the release notes in the release-python-package GitHub workflow has been corrected. The version number now correctly includes a 'v' prefix when reading the markdown file (3884962) (Eric Ma).
- The path for the release notes in the GitHub Actions workflow has been corrected. The previous path was causing issues in the workflow execution. The path has been updated to correctly point to the release notes file (3884962) (Eric Ma).

### Bug Fixes

- The file path for the release notes in the release-python-package GitHub workflow was incorrect and has been fixed (3884962) (Eric Ma).

### Deprecations

- The step of copying release notes to a temporary location has been removed and the original file is directly referenced in the release action. This simplifies the workflow and reduces unnecessary operations (3884962) (Eric Ma).
- The 'outlines' package was removed from the dependencies in the environment.yml and pyproject.toml files (af23aae) (Eric Ma).

### Refactors

- The use of the `outlines` package has been replaced with a custom `prompt_manager` module across multiple files in the `llamabot` project. The `prompt_manager` provides a `prompt` decorator that turns Python functions into Jinja2-templated prompts, similar to the functionality provided by `outlines`. This refactor removes the dependency on the `outlines` package, simplifying the project's dependencies and potentially improving maintainability (dbe78e4) (Eric Ma).
