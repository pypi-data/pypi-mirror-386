## 0.0.52

This new version includes an important bug fix and updates to the tutorial content for the Llamabot Zotero CLI.

### New Features

- The tutorial content for the Llamabot Zotero CLI has been updated to provide a more accurate and user-friendly guide. Changes include rewording the introduction, updating the prerequisites section, removing the section on syncing Zotero items, and adding sections on various topics such as chatting with a paper, retrieving keys, downloading papers, and asking questions (fab7d3) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- The field declaration for 'zot' in ZoteroLibrary class has been changed to use default_factory instead of default. This ensures that the load_zotero function is called when a new instance of ZoteroLibrary is created, rather than at import time (c65618) (Eric Ma)

### Deprecations

- No deprecations in this release.
