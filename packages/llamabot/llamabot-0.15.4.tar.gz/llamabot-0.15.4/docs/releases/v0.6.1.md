## Version 0.6.1

This release includes several improvements and updates to the documentation, as well as new functionality for finding prime numbers.

### New Features

- Added functionality to find the next prime number. This includes an `is_prime` function to check primality and a `next_prime` function to find the next prime number after a given number. (22b73f3) (Eric Ma)
- Refactored the `test_docs` module to use an external source file and improve function documentation. This includes using `Path` for reading external prime number source code and updating docstrings in `is_prime` and `next_prime` functions. (196bde2) (Eric Ma)
- Updated the `llamabot` documentation to reflect source code changes and add new test cases. This includes updating the documentation and test suite for new source code changes and adding comprehensive test cases for documentation validation. (4308ba3) (Eric Ma)
- Improved the formatting and clarity of the CLI documentation for the `llamabot docs write` command. This includes reformatting the `--from-scratch` flag section for better clarity, updating the frontmatter section to specify YAML format, simplifying the example section with a complete Markdown file, and changing file and intent sections in the Python script for clearer content blocks.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with the `llamabot docs write` command to ensure content is cleared at the correct stage when writing from scratch. This includes moving content clearing to the start of the write function if `from_scratch` is true. (e78b3f1) (Eric Ma)

- Updated the documentation for the `next_prime` function. This includes providing a tutorial on how to use the prime number function and explaining any optimizations made in the source code. (99ae504) (Eric Ma)
