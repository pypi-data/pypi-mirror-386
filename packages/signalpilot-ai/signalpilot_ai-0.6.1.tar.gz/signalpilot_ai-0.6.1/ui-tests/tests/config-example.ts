/**
 * Test configuration for Sage LLM tests
 *
 * IMPORTANT: UPDATE THESE VALUES
 * Before running these tests, you MUST:
 * 1. Set your API key in SAGE_API_KEY below (replace 'your-api-key-here')
 * 2. Ensure the model URL and ID are correct for your setup
 * 3. Have JupyterLab running with the Sage extension installed
 *
 * No .env file is needed - all configuration is done in this file.

Make simple assumptions such as investing $1000 per month etc and also figure out if this strategy can or a variant of this could outperform simple DCA strategy. Ask for confirmation after plan creation. Do not assume I have libraries, install any library that wouldnt be in a default python environment\n'
