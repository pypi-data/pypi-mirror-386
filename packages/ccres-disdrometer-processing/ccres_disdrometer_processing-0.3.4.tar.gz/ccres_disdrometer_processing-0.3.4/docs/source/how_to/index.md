## Different command lines available in the package

:::

   | **Command** | **Description** |
   |------|------|
   |   `preprocess`   |   Preprocess daily data from CLU daily instruments files : outputs a preprocessing file   |
   |   `preprocess_ql`   |   Generates daily quicklooks at specified paths from daily preprocessing file + a configuration file   |
   |   `process`   |   Outputs a daily processing file from a daily preprocesing file and the neighbouring days' preprocessing files   |
   |   `process_ql`   |   Generates quicklooks focusing on detected rain events at specified paths from daily processing file and the neighbouring day's preprocessing files + configuration file   |
