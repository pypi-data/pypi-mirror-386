"""
Fault Tolerance (FT) package integration for Megatron-Bridge, using the FT section-based API.

The FT package is included in "nvidia-resiliency-ext"
(https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-resiliency-ext).

NOTE: The workload must be run using the `ft_launcher` tool provided by `nvidia-resiliency-ext.`
NOTE: Calls to the public API of this module are no-ops if FT is not initialized
(`fault_tolerance.setup` was not called).
NOTE: Default distributed process group should be initialized before calling `fault_tolerance.setup`

The "setup" FT section is opened during FT initialization and closed before the first training or
eval iteration. Training and evaluation steps are wrapped in the "step" section, but only after a
few warmup iterations. This is because the initial iterations may be slower, and we want the "step"
timeout to be short. These warmup steps, which are not wrapped in the "step" section, will fall into
the out-of-section area. All checkpoint-saving-related operations (including asynchronous
checkpointing finalization) are wrapped in the "checkpointing" section.

If timeout calculation is enabled (--calc-ft-timeouts),
FT timeouts are updated after each checkpoint and at the end of the run.
Updated values are based on observed intervals.

`ft_launcher` command example:
```
ft_launcher \
    --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=${MASTER_ADDR}:${MASTER_PORT} \
    --nnodes=${NUM_NODES} --nproc-per-node=${NUM_GPUS_PER_NODE} \
    --ft-param-rank_section_timeouts=setup:600,step:180,checkpointing:420 \
    --ft-param-rank_out_of_section_timeout=300 \
    train_script_with_ft.py
```
