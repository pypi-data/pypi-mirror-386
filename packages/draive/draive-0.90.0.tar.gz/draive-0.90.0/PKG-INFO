üèéÔ∏è An all-in-one, flexible Python library for building powerful LLM workflows and AI apps. üèéÔ∏è

Draive gives you everything you need to turn large language models into production-ready software:
agents, structured workflows, tool use, instruction refinement, guardrails, observability, and
seamless multi-model integration ‚Äî all in one clean, composable package.

If you've ever felt like you‚Äôre stitching together glue code and hoping for the best ‚Äî Draive is
what you wish you'd started with!

## üöÄ Quick start

Here‚Äôs what a simple Draive setup looks like:

```python
from draive import ctx, TextGeneration, tool
from draive.openai import OpenAI, OpenAIResponsesConfig

@tool # simply annotate a function as a tool
async def current_time(location: str) -> str:
    return f"Time in {location} is 9:53:22"

async with  ctx.scope( # create execution context
    "example", # give it a name
    OpenAIResponsesConfig(model="gpt-4o-mini"), # prepare configuration
    disposables=(OpenAI(),), # define resources and service clients available
):
    result: str = await TextGeneration.generate( # choose a right generation abstraction
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant", # provide clear instructions
        input="What is the time in Krak√≥w?", # give it some input (including multimodal)
        tools=[current_time], # and select any tools you like
    )

    print(result) # to finally get the result!
    # output: The current time in Krak√≥w is 9:53:22.
```

Read the [Draive Documentation](https://miquido.github.io/draive/) for all required knowledge.

repository.

## ‚ùì What is Draive good for

Draive is built for developers who want clarity, flexibility, and control when working with LLMs.

Whether you‚Äôre building an autonomous agent, automating data flow, extracting information from
documents, handling audio or images ‚Äî Draive has your back.

### What you can do with Draive

- **üîÅ Start with evaluation** - make sure your app behaves as expected, right from the start
- **üõ† Turn any Python function into a tool** that LLMs can call
- **üîÑ Switch between providers** like OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or Mistral in seconds
- **üß± Design structured workflows** with reusable stages
- **üõ° Enforce output quality using guardrails** including moderation and runtime evaluation
- **üìä Monitor with ease** - plug into any OpenTelemetry-compatible services
- **‚öôÔ∏è Control your context** - use on-the-fly LLM context modifications for best results

### Why you'll like it

- **Instruction Optimization**: Draive gives you clean ways to write and refine prompts, including
  metaprompts, instruction helpers, and optimizers. You can go from raw prompt text to a reusable,
  structured config in no time.
- **Composable Workflows**: Build modular flows using Stages and Tools. Every piece is reusable,
  testable, and fits together seamlessly.
- **Tooling = Just Python**: Define a tool by writing a function. Annotate it. That‚Äôs it. Draive
  handles the rest ‚Äî serialization, context, and integration with LLMs.
- **Structured Outputs** - use Python classes for JSON outputs and flexible multimodal XML parser
  for custom results transformations.
- **Telemetry + Evaluators**: Draive logs everything you care about: timing, output shape, tool
  usage, error cases. Evaluators let you benchmark or regression-test LLM behavior like a normal
  part of your CI.
- **Model-Agnostic by Design**: Built-in support for most major providers.

## üñ•Ô∏è Install

With pip:

```bash
pip install draive
```

### Optional dependencies

Draive library comes with optional integrations to 3rd party services:

- OpenAI:

well.

```bash
pip install 'draive[openai]'
```

- Anthropic:

```bash
pip install 'draive[anthropic]'
```

- Gemini:
