# Solana/SPL Token/Introduction

After the last lesson, the students spent a great deal of time outside of class trying to add more features to the Thai Baht Coin program, such as tracking the total supply. As the functionality grew, so did their exhaustion.

Student: "Teacher, when I look back at the improved Thai Baht Coin program I wrote, it feels like I'm trying to build a skyscraper out of toothpicks..."

Teacher: "That's a pretty accurate metaphor. You've shown great perseverance, but your approach is still a bit... stone age."

Student: "I have to write the minting logic myself, manually update balances during transfers, and track all sorts of stats. I'm turning into an on-chain accountant. Isn't there some tool that can help me take a shortcut?"

The Teacher leans back tactically.

Teacher: "Of course there is, my child! Solana isn't some survival island, it's metropolitan blockchain living. We've got SPL Token: professional, secure, and with 100% wallet recognition. It's like flat-pack furniture from IKEA, just assemble and you're good to go."

Student: "Wow, that's a new term! So, what exactly is an SPL Token?"

Teacher: "It's a token standard on the Solana network. And remember, it's not just a standard buy it also comes with ready-to-use code."

Student: "So I can move my Thai Baht Coin logic over? Redefine it using SPL Token?"

Teacher: "You should! All that handwritten PDA and integer math? SPL had that for breakfast two years ago."

Student: "Haha, I better upgrade fast. Otherwise, I'll lose my investors from debugging alone before my Bubble Coin even launches."

Teacher: "Excellent. This lesson, we'll dive into SPL Token and set you on the righteous path of launching a **standards-compliant** Thai Baht Coin!"
