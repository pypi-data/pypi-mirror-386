# Solana/Deploying Your Token on the Mainnet/Introduction

The student excitedly rushed into the classroom.

Student: "Teacher! I've made up my mind, I'm going to deploy my Bubble Coin on the Solana mainnet!"

Teacher: "Are you sure you don't want to change the name? It sounds a bit like a bubble economy. By the way, how do you plan to launch it?"

Student: "I already have a token-2022 mint contract. I want people to be able to buy and sell, maybe do some airdrops, build a website, get it listed on some DEXs, and reach the peak of Web3!"

Teacher: "Hold on, let me check your Bubble Coin. Hmm, why doesn't your Bubble Coin have a logo? Don't forget to set the logo URL. People are visual creatures, without a logo, no one's going to buy!"

Student: "I think I might have set the URL incorrectly. Let me fix that."

Teacher: "Good. So, how do you plan to distribute your Bubble Coin next? Right now, you're the only holder of this coin."

Student: "I want to send coins to my friends to celebrate, airdrop 1000 Bubble Coins! After that, I want to create a claiming website so that strangers can connect their wallets and claim the coins."

Teacher: "Very good!"

Student: "I hope people can freely trade Bubble Coin. I need to create a trading pool on Raydium!"

Teacher: "Creating a trading pool requires providing initial liquidity. Make sure you have enough funds."

Student: "I also need to build trust. I'm worried people will call Bubble Coin a scam."

Teacher: "Exactly. You can lock your tokens and make it public to the community. Don't forget to write a whitepaper and roadmap, clarifying the use case, inflation mechanisms, expected development, and so on."

Student: "Teacher, I got it!"
