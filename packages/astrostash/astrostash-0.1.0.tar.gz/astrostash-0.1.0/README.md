# astrostash

**An astronomy and astrophysics database building/syncing tool**

Astrostash is designed to allow users to "stash" query results from astronomy/astrophysics data sources (e.g., HEASARC) into a local SQLite3 database. This ensures data retention and reduces reliance on external services for recurring queries.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Local data storage**: Retain copies of query results in a SQLite3 database so you can keep your own copy of the data you use and care about having access to.
- **Efficient querying**: Prioritizes querying from your local database before pulling data externally to limit external requests.
