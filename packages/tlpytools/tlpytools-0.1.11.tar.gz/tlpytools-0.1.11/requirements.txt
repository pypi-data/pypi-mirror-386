# Core dependencies are managed in pyproject.toml
# Use 'uv sync' to install dependencies
# Use 'uv sync --extra dev' to install with development dependencies
# Use 'uv sync --extra orca' to install with ORCA orchestrator dependencies
# Use 'uv sync --group activitysim' to install ActivitySim and PopulationSim (development only)

# For pip compatibility, you can also use:
# pip install -e .
# pip install -e .[dev]
# pip install -e .[orca]
# Note: ActivitySim not available as pip extra due to PyPI git dependency restrictions

# Note: This replaces the previous manual dependency management.
# All dependencies are now declared in pyproject.toml and managed by uv.
