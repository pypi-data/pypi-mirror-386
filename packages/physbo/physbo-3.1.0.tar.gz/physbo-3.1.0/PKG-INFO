# optimization tools for PHYsics based on Bayesian Optimization ( PHYSBO )

Bayesian optimization has been proven as an effective tool in accelerating scientific discovery.
A standard implementation (e.g., scikit-learn), however, can accommodate only small training data.
PHYSBO is highly scalable due to an efficient protocol that employs Thompson sampling, random feature maps, one-rank Cholesky update and automatic hyperparameter tuning. Technical features are described in [COMBO's document](https://github.com/tsudalab/combo/blob/master/docs/combo_document.pdf) and [PHYSBO's report](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2022.108405) (open access).
PHYSBO was developed based on [COMBO](https://github.com/tsudalab/combo) for academic use.
