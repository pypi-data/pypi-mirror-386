[CDF-25973] ðŸ™‚ Create SourceSystem (#2108)

# Description

**Context**: This is part of the `alpha` migration tooling in Toolkit,
for overview [see
here](https://cognitedata.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~170890702/pages/5455773697/Migration+Tooling+in+Toolkit).
This is a new step between 2 and 3.

Before we can migrate assets/event/files/timeseries/sequences, we need
to have a destination target space as well as CogniteSourceSystems
created.
