"""
Data writers module for piblin-jax.

This module provides functionality for writing piblin-jax data structures
to various file formats. Writer implementations will be added in future
phases to support common data serialization formats.

Future implementations may include:
- CSV writers for tabular data
- HDF5 writers for large datasets
- JSON/YAML writers for metadata
- Binary formats for efficient storage

Examples
--------
Future usage example::

    from piblin_jax.dataio.writers import CSVWriter

    writer = CSVWriter()
    writer.write(dataset, 'output.csv')
