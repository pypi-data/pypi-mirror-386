"""Early initialization for provide-testkit.

This module is imported via a .pth file during Python's site initialization,
before any user code runs. It installs the setproctitle import blocker early
enough to prevent pytest-xdist from importing setproctitle and causing macOS
UX freezing.

The .pth file approach ensures the blocker is installed:
- Before pytest starts
- Before any conftest.py files are loaded
- Before any test collection happens
- At the same time as sitecustomize.py would run

This provides the best developer experience - completely automatic activation
with zero configuration needed.
