### Major Release
This release provides a comprehensive, production-ready library and documentation for interacting with Bambu Lab printers via cloud and local protocols without requiring developer mode.

### Added
- **Complete Python Library** (`bambulab/`)
  - `BambuClient` - Full Cloud API implementation with authentication, token management, and auto-refresh
  - `MQTTClient` - Real-time MQTT monitoring with comprehensive message parsing
  - `LocalFTPClient` - Secure FTP file upload for local network operations
  - `JPEGFrameStream` / `RTSPStream` - Video streaming support for camera integration
- **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - API reference split into logical modules: Authentication, Devices, Users, Files/Printing, AMS/Filament, Camera, MQTT
  - Python, JavaScript, and cURL examples for all endpoints
  - Complete response schemas with actual field documentation
  - G-code and MQTT command references
- **Testing Suite** (`tests/`)
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all API endpoints
  - MQTT stream monitoring and validation
  - File upload testing with cloud and local FTP
  - Camera stream integration tests
  - Detailed output of all API responses for verification
- **CLI Tools** (`cli_tools/`)
  - Device query and management utilities
  - Real-time MQTT monitoring tools
  - File upload helpers
- **Server Components** (`servers/`)
  - Compatibility layer bridging legacy local API to cloud API
  - Proxy servers with read-only and full access modes
  - Custom authentication support

### Documentation
- All API endpoints fully documented with request/response examples
- MQTT message structure and topic documentation
- Camera streaming protocols (TUTK/RTSP/JPEG)
- FTP upload procedures for local and cloud
- Authentication flows with token lifecycle management

### Verified Functionality
- Cloud API: 40+ endpoints across devices, users, projects, tasks, messages, preferences, filaments
- MQTT: Real-time status, temperatures, fan speeds, print progress, AMS status, HMS error codes
- File Operations: Cloud upload, local FTP, project management
- Camera: TTCode retrieval, local JPEG/RTSP streaming
- Authentication: Email/password, verification codes, token refresh, multi-device support
