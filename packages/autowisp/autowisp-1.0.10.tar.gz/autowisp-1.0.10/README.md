## üöÄ About

**AutoWISP** is a software pipeline for extracting high-precision photometry
from astronomical observations, with special features designed for
consumer-grade color cameras (e.g., DSLRs). Developed to empower citizen
scientists, **AutoWISP** provides a complete, automated workflow from raw images
to science-ready light curves, enabling transformative contributions to
time-domain astronomy.  

It adheres to high standards of flexibility, reusability, and reliability,
utilizing well-known software design patterns, including modular and hexagonal
architectures. These patterns ensure the following benefits:

- **Modularity**: Different parts of the package can function independently,
  enhancing the package's modularity and allowing for easier maintenance and
  updates.

- **Testability**: Improved separation of concerns makes the code more testable.

- **Maintainability**: Clear structure and separation facilitate better
  management of the codebase.

## üìù How to Install

**AutoWISP** is a Python 3 package. The core AstroWISP components are
pre-compiled for all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and
included in the distribution.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install
**AutoWISP**.

    pip install autowisp

## üìö Documentation

To better understand the **AutoWISP** pipeline, we recommend visiting our
[Documentation](https://kpenev.github.io/AutoWISP/) site. There, you will find
useful information about the individual steps, database, and/or
browser-user-interface (currently under development).

Briefly, the image processing pipeline steps and their products are shown. The
arrows indicate the products of each step and where they will be used.:

</p>

The general procedures are as follows:

### Calibration

Users input their raw fits images (flat, dark, bias, or object image types as
specified from their fits headers). These images are then pre-processed, where
master calibration frames are generated, then frames are calibrated with these
masters. This is a similar implementation as used by the HATNet, HATSouth, and
HATPI projects.

Here are example dark, flat, bias, object frames (in order as listed) gathered
from a Sony-Œ±7R DSLR Camera:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpenev/AutoWISP/master/.github/images/ds9_dark.png">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpenev/AutoWISP/master/.github/images/ds9_flat.png">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpenev/AutoWISP/master/.github/images/ds9_bias.png">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpenev/AutoWISP/master/.github/images/ds9_object.png">
</p>

The overall calibration for object frames is given by $C(I)= \frac{I - O(I) -
B_0 - (\frac{\tau[I]}{\tau[D_0]})D_0}{F_0/||F_0||}$.

Where $I$, $O(I)$, and $C(I)$ represent the image, over-scan region, and
calibrated image respectively; $B_0$, $D_0$, and $F_0$ represents masters
calibration images of bias, dark, and flat respectively; $\tau[I]$ and
$\tau[D_0]$ are the exposure times of the image and dark frame respectively.
These master frames are stacks of individually calibrated bias, dark, and flat
frames. As a result, their signal-to-noise ratio is significantly increased
compared to individual unstacked frames, allowing for much better calibration

### Source Extraction 

After the pre-processing, we extract the source (star) positions from the images
and perform astrometry (plate-solving) to find a transformation that allows us
to map sky coordinates (RA, Dec) into image coordinates. This allows the use of
external catalogue data for more precise positions of the sources than can be
extracted from survey images and the use of auxiliary data provided in the
catalogue about each source in the subsequent processing steps of the pipeline.

### Astrometry

Next, for each calibrated object frame, we extract flux measurements, background
level, and uncertainties for the catalogue sources found in the image, which map
to some position within the frame using the astrometric transformation derived
in the previous step. This step is performed using AstroWISP, and we refer the
reader to that article for a detailed description. We briefly summarize the
process here for completeness.

step placed on top of the corresponding FITS image, where blue squares are the
catalogues projected sources and red squares are the extracted sources from our
astrometry

### Photometry

**AutoWISP** takes into account the response of the pixels due to the fact that
the same amount of light falling on one part of the pixel is likely to produce a
different response in a different part of the pixel, this is what we call
sub-pixel sensitivity. Non-uniform sensitivity on a sub-pixel level affects the
PRF in an image, and the effect depends on where within a pixel the center of
the source lies. Thus, it is necessary to correct for the sub-pixel sensitivity
variations when deriving PSFs for a given image. For example, for DSLR or color
images, we can consider the Bayer mask, which is a filter that is superimposed
on the detector with arrangement of pixels sensitive to different colors in
super-pixels. Since each color accounts for 1/4th of the super-pixel, the Bayer
mask is an extreme version of the varying amount of the sub-pixel sensitivity.
When processing a singular color channel, 3/4th of the pixel area can be
considered completely insensitive to light.

There are many flavors of photometry. This pipeline supports: point spread
function (PSF) or pixel response function (PRF) fitting (where the PRF is the
PSF convolved with the sub-pixel sensitivity), and aperture photometry, with
aperture photometry requiring PSF fitting.

#### PSF Fitting:

For each point source, we first measure the distribution of light on the
detector (the PSF). The idea of PSF fitting is to model that distribution as
some smooth parametric function centered on the projected source position with
an integral equal to 1. The flux of the source is then found from a least
squares scaling between the predicted and observed pixel values. While the flux
will differ for each star, the shape parameters are assumed to vary smoothly as
a function of source properties and position within the image. In principle,
smooth changes can also be imposed across images, though that requires a highly
stable observing platform in practice. For our implementation, we also take the
sub-pixel sensitivity into account due to the non-uniform sensitivity of the
sub-pixel level as previously described. Lastly, we store the PSF information
for later use during aperture photometry. 

#### PRF Fitting:

Similar to the PSF, we can perform PRF fitting. The PRF can be thought of as a
super-resolution image of the light of a star falling on the individual pixels,
where it is represented as a continuous piecewise polynomial function of
sub-pixel position on each pixel (i.e., the PSF convolved with the sub-pixel
sensitivity).

#### Aperture Photometry:

After PSF fitting, we perform aperture photometry, a photometry method that sums
the flux within a circular aperture centered on each source. For aperture
photometry, we correct for non‚Äìuniform pixels by using the sub-pixel sensitivity
information/map and adequately integrate the PSF model to determine the
fractional contributions of pixels straddling the aperture boundary.

### Magnitude Fitting

After extracting flux measurements, we perform ensemble magnitude fitting. The
photometry of individual frames is calibrated to the photometry of a reference
frame by applying a correction as a smooth function of image position,
brightness, color, and other user-specified parameters. This procedure excludes
stars showing significantly larger variability than other similarly bright stars
and is repeated multiple times, where the reference frame is replaced with a
stack of many frames corrected in the previous iteration.

### Light Curve Generation

Next, we create light curves. This is a transpose operation, collecting the
photometry of each star from all images and putting them in a single file (the
light curve) (see [Demonstration](#%EF%B8%8F-demonstration) for an example light
curve)

 ### Post Processing

Finally, after producing light curves, we perform post-processing using external
parameter decorrelation (EPD) and trend filtering algorithm (TFA) to correct
effects not corrected during magnitude fitting, further improving photometric
precision.

Here we show the overall improvement from our post-processing steps for the
Sony-Œ±7R DSLR Camera dataset used:

The scatter (median absolute deviation from the median (MAD)) of the individual
channel light curves vs. GAIA G magnitude before EPD (only magnitude-fitting)
(indicated by yellow points), after EPD but before TFA (indicated by purple
points), and after TFA (indicated by their corresponding channel color (B
(blue), G1 (green), G2 (green), R (red)) points).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Demonstration


For a hands-on example, you can explore our Jupyter Notebook which processes a
test dataset from start to finish.

[View the interactive Processing Example on
GitHub](https://github.com/kpenev/AutoWISP/blob/master/autowisp/tests/test_data/test_data.ipynb)
or [View the interactive Processing Example on
nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/kpenev/AutoWISP/blob/master/autowisp/tests/test_data/test_data.ipynb).

This interactive notebook provides a practical demonstration of the **AutoWISP**
pipeline in action, going step by step in the pipeline, producing the
corresponding files needed for each step and ultimately creating light curves
using a test dataset we provide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All the following images were created using tools in this repository.

### Example Light Curves

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpenev/AutoWISP/master/.github/images/wasp33_with_tess.png">
</p>

This is the resulting phase-folded lightcurve for WASP-33 b exoplanet transit,
observed by Project PANOPTES (blue points and circles), TESS (red points), and
theoretical light curve based on best known system parameters (green curve). The
raw PANOPTES-DSLR measurements, originating from the 4 color channels of 4
cameras in Hawaii (Mauna Loa observatory) and California (Mt Wilson) are shown
as blue points. The blue points are binned in time to create the blue circles
and corresponding error bars. Note that the scatter in TESS points is not
instrumental, but rather it is intrinsic variability in the host star, which is
a member of the delta-Scuti class of variable stars.

### Example Photometric Precision 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpenev/AutoWISP/master/.github/images/mad_plot.png">
</p>

The scatter (median absolute deviation from the median) of the individual
channel lightcurves of PANOPTES observations of a $10\times15$ degree field
centered on FU Orionis, with each of their corresponding image colors (RGGB). We
see that **AutoWISP** enables a few parts per thousand photometric precision per
exposure even from images with Bayer masks, significantly outperforming prior
efforts. Even individual color channels result in better than 1% photometry per
2 min exposure.
