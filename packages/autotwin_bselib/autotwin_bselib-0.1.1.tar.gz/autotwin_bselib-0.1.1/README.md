# Battery SoC Estimation Library for Auto-Twin

A lumped-parameter Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) is developed. It simulates
battery performance under various working conditions and its parameters are
continuously updating based on operational data. An algorithm is implemented
using this model for the hybrid estimation of the battery's State of Charge
(SOC).
