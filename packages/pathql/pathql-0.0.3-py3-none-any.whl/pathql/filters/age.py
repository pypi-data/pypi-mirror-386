"""
Provides filter classes for querying files based on their age (time since last
modification) in minutes, hours, days, or years. These filters support declarative
operator overloads, allowing expressive queries such as `AgeDays < 10` or
`AgeYears >= 1`.

Classes:
    AgeMinutes  -- Filter for file age in minutes.
    AgeHours    -- Filter for file age in hours.
    AgeDays     -- Filter for file age in days.
    AgeYears    -- Filter for file age in years.

Each filter uses a comparison operator and a threshold value, and can be used to
match files whose modification time meets the specified age criteria.

NOTE: We specifically use modification time (mtime) for age calculations, as it is
widely supported across different operating systems and file systems. Creation time
(ctime) is not consistently available or consistent across platforms (surprisingly),
so we avoid using it for age-based filters. If you must have creation time-based
filtering you can build one using something like:

Created < some_datetime

This will use the created timestamp and will often be correct, surprisingly working
better on Windows than on Unix-like systems.
