This method polls the agent's status at regular intervals until completion.
During waiting, it displays progress updates and a spinner (in non-notebook environments).
The polling continues until either the agent completes or a timeout is reached.



## Returns

[`AgentStatusResponse`](/sdk-reference/misc/agentstatusresponse): The final status response after completion.

## Raises

- `TimeoutError`: If the agent doesn't complete within the maximum allowed attempts.
