title: "stop"
description: "Stop the session and clean up resources"
---



This method sends a close request to the API and verifies that the session
was properly closed. It logs the session closure and raises an error if
the session fails to close.

**Example:**
```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

client = NotteClient()
session = client.Session()
session.start()
session.stop()
```

> Note that we strongly recommend using the `with` statement to start and stop the session to avoid any issues with session cleanup.

**Example:**
```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

client = NotteClient()
with client.Session() as session:
    session.execute({"type": "goto", "url": "https://www.notte.cc"})
```



## Returns

`None`

## Raises

- `ValueError`: If the session hasn't been started (no session_id available).
- `RuntimeError`: If the session fails to close properly.
