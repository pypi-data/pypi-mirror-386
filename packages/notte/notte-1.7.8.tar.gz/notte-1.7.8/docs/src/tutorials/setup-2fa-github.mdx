## Overview

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) for GitHub and integrating it with [Notte Vaults](concepts/vaults).

At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Set up 2FA on your GitHub account
- Store your 2FA secret securely in Notte Vaults
- Use Notte Agents to perform authenticated GitHub actions like [starring our repo](https://github.com/nottelabs/notte/tree/main/examples/star-our-repo)


<Note>
  **Why does Notte need access to the 2FA secret?**

  Notte Vaults are designed to perform actions on your behalf on third-party services like GitHub. To do this securely, Notte needs to authenticate as you. While we could alternatively request access to your email account to retrieve signin codes, using the 2FA secret directly is more secure and reliable.
</Note>


## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- A 2FA app on your phone (e.g. Authy, Google Authenticator) or laptop (e.g. TOTP on Mac)
- A Notte account
- Understand the difference between a 2FA secret and a 2FA code:
  - A 2FA secret is a secret key that is used to generate a 2FA code (i.e. a longer string of characters that should look like this: `TBTW6Y9TKNXG4QCJMRBKVQ2LSJJDFAUFA`). This secret is generally used to generate a QR code that you can then scan on your phone to setup 2FA.
  - A 2FA code is a code that is generated by the 2FA app on your phone or laptop to verify your identity (i.e. 6 digits code like 123456)


## Disclaimer

If you have already set up 2FA on your phone, some apps such as [TOTP Authenticator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/totp-authenticator-fast-2fa/id1404230533) will allow you to retrieve the 2FA secret from the app directly, but most apps will not.
In that case, there are usually 2 options at your disposal:
1. Either you use a package like [extract_otp_secrets](https://github.com/scito/extract_otp_secrets) to retrieve the 2FA secret from the QR code image.
2. Or you take the easy route and reset your 2FA settings and generate a new 2FA secret (and save it in Notte Vaults)


<Tip>For this tutorial, we will take the easy route and reset your 2FA settings and generate a new 2FA secret.</Tip>



## Tutorial

Here are the steps to set up a new 2FA secret for GitHub:
1. Sign in to GitHub
2. Update your 2FA settings to generate a new 2FA secret.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access GitHub Security Settings">
    Go to [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/security) and sign in if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the `Two-factor methods` section and `edit` authenticator app  (or `Enable 2FA` if you never set up 2FA before)">
    Click on "Enable 2FA" and follow the instructions to generate a new 2FA secret.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve the new 2FA secret generated by GitHub">
    Click on `setup key` and store the secret in a secure place. We will need that later on to setup the 2FA secret in Notte Vaults.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup 2FA on your phone or laptop">
    This is the usual setup process for 2FA on your phone or laptop where you can simply scan the QR code with your 2FA app and enter the code generated by the app on GitHub.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the 2FA secret in Notte Vaults">
    Use the following Python code to save the 2FA secret in Notte Vaults:
    ```python save_2fa_secret.py
    # Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials
    vault.add_credential(
        url="https://github.com",
        username="your_github_username",
        password="your_github_password",
        secret="your_2fa_secret"
    )
    ```

    <Note>
      Make sure to keep your 2FA secret secure and never share it publicly. If you believe your secret has been compromised, immediately disable 2FA and set it up again with a new secret.
    </Note>
  </Step>

</Steps>

Congratulations! You have now set up 2FA for GitHub and can use it with Notte Vaults.
