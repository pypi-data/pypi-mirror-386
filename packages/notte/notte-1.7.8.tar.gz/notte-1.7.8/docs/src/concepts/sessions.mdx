# Overview

Sessions are the heart of our ecosystem. They maintain browser states and provide a reliable foundation for executing web-based operations.
Every operation in the Notte ecosystem is performed on behalf of a session (agent, scrape, vault, etc.)

# Session Management

This shows how to manage your browser sessions using the Notte Python SDK
<SessionsPython />

<Info>
We strongly recommend using the API using a `with` statement to manage the session lifecycle and ensure it is stopped when the context manager is exited.

### Key points

* **Timeouts:** Use the `timeout_minutes` parameter to specify when a session should be stopped if no actions are performed on it (no activity). Note that by default, sessions are stopped after 3 minutes of inactivity.
* **Session IDs:** Each session is uniquely identified, e.g. `5767be3c-aef5-47f8-bcb0-4f9f80fa66a3` and is tied to an API Key.

# Operations

import ScrapePython from '/snippets/pages/scrape.mdx';
import LinkedInStep from '/snippets/pages/linkedin_step.mdx';

Operations provide granular control on the browser session:

* `observe()` To get the current state of a page and its available actions
* `execute()` To execute an action you've previously observed on a page
* `scrape()` To extract structured data from a page
