    The Notte SDK also allows you to observe a web page and its actions, scrape the page content, as well as execute actions in a running session:
    * **Observe**: observe the actions available on a webpage
    * **Step**: take an action on the page (e.g., click a button, fill in a form, etc.)
    * **Scrape**: scrape a page in markdown format (or in a structured format using `BaseModel` from `pydantic`)
