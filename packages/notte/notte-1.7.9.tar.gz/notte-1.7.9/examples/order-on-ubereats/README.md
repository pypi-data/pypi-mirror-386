## Setup

Fill in your actual uber credentials in your env variables or in a .env file (.env.example provided).
(Your account should already have an address set if you want to go through the whole thing)
In the current state, the agent stops (willingly) just before ordering, you can then take over and fill in actual information.

## Run the agent

```bash
python agent.py
```
