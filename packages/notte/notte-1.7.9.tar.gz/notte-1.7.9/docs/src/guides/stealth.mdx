### Resolving Bot Detection Issues

Bot detection is a common challenge for web agents. This guide provides strategies to bypass these detection mechanisms using Notte's stealth configuration options.

Common Bot Detection Challenges:
- Accessing e-commerce sites with anti-bot measures
- Scraping content from news or social media platforms
- Interacting with banking or financial websites
- Accessing sites with geographic restrictions

### Stealth Configuration Strategies

#### 1. Proxy Configuration

Proxies are one of the most effective ways to bypass bot detection. Different proxy configurations can help you appear as legitimate traffic from various locations.

#### Using Default Proxies
Enable Notte's built-in residential proxies for better anonymity:

<DefaultProxy/>

#### Country-Specific Proxies
For sites with geographic restrictions, use proxies from specific countries:

<CountryProxy/>

### 2. Browser Type Selection

Different browsers have varying levels of detection resistance. Experiment with different browser types for your specific use case:

```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

notte = NotteClient()

# Try different browser types
browsers = ["chromium", "chrome", "firefox"]
for browser in browsers:
	with notte.Session(
		browser_type=browser,
		proxies=True,
		solve_captchas=True
	) as session:
		result = session.observe(url="https://example.com")
		print(f"Success with {browser}")
```
<Tip>
  `chromium` is the default browser type but is the most easily detected.
</Tip>

### 3. CAPTCHA Solving

Enable automatic CAPTCHA solving for sites that use these challenges:

<CaptchaSolving />

<Warning>
  Not all CAPTCHA types are supported. Some complex CAPTCHAs may still require manual intervention.
</Warning>

## Complete Stealth Configuration Example

Here's a comprehensive example combining all stealth techniques:

<StealthConfiguration />

## Troubleshooting Tips
1. **Start Simple**. Begin with basic configurations and gradually add complexity:
    - Try `proxies=True` first
    - Add `solve_captchas=True` if needed
    - Experiment with different `browser_type` values
    - Add custom `user_agent` if still detected
2. **Test Incrementally**. Test each configuration change individually to identify what works:
3. **Monitor for Patterns**. Keep track of which configurations work for different types of sites:
	- E-commerce sites often respond well to residential proxies
	- Social media sites may require specific user agents
	- Banking sites may need country-specific proxies

## Best Practices

1. **Rotate Configurations**: Don't rely on a single configuration: it makes it easier to track you
2. **Monitor Success Rates**: Verify which configurations work best for different site types
3. **Respect Rate Limits**: Implement delays between requests to avoid triggering rate limiting
4. **Keep Configurations Updated**: Bot detection methods evolve, so regularly test and update your configurations
