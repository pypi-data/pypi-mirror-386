## Overview

Notte provides an enterprise-grade secure vault system that allows you to safely share authentication details with AI agents.
All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit, and credentials are never exposed to LLMs or third-party services during agent execution.
This ensures your passwords, API keys, and other secrets remain protected while enabling agents to authenticate and interact with services on your behalf.

## Secure your credentials

Your credentials are protected with multiple layers of security:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Credentials are never forwarded to LLM calls or external services.
- **Restricted Access**: Only your agents can access your credentials.
- **2FA Support**: Comprehensive support for two-factor authentication credentials.

## How it works

The Vault acts as an intermediary between the LLM agent and the browser session.
Some actions like `FillActions` may contain secure information such as passwords, credit card numbers, MFA secrets, etc.
When the system detects that the intent of the LLM Agent is to use such sensitive information, the vault takes over the execution and manually replaces the dummy
credentials provided by the LLM with the actual credentials based on the content of the vault.

The significant security benefit of this approach is that the LLM never actually sees the actual credentials.

## Vault Management

## Security Guarantees

- ðŸ”’ Credentials are never stored in plain text
- ðŸ”’ No credential data is sent to LLM providers
- ðŸ”’ All credential operations are performed locally
- ðŸ”’ Access to credentials is strictly controlled and logged
- ðŸ”’ Open-source implementation for transparency

<Tip>
The Notte Vault system is built on top of [Infisical](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical), an open-source secrets management platform. You can verify our security implementation by checking our open-source repository.
