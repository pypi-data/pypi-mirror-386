title: "check_and_warn_version_mismatch"
description: "Check if the current notte-sdk version matches the latest PyPI version"
---



This method performs the version check only once per process and caches the result
globally. If there's a version mismatch, it displays a warning to encourage users
to upgrade their installation.

The check is performed silently - if the PyPI request fails, no warning is shown
to avoid disrupting the user experience. Development versions (containing '.dev')
are skipped since they're not released on PyPI


## Returns
