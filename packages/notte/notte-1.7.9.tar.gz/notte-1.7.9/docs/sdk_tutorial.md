# Notte SDK Tutorial

## Manage your sessions


```python
from notte_sdk.client import NotteClient
import os
notte = NotteClient(api_key=os.getenv("NOTTE_API_KEY"))

# start / stop your session using the context manager
with notte.Session(timeout_minutes=5) as session:
    # get the session status
    status = session.status()
# list your active sessions
active_sessions = notte.sessions.list()
print(len(active_sessions))
```

## Connect over CDP

```python
import os
from patchright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

notte = NotteClient(api_key=os.getenv("NOTTE_API_KEY"))
with notte.Session(proxies=False) as session:
    # get cdp url
    cdp_url = session.cdp_url()
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(cdp_url)
        page = browser.contexts[0].pages[0]
        _ = page.goto("https://www.google.com")
        screenshot = page.screenshot(path="screenshot.png")
        assert screenshot is not None
```

you can also easily visualize the live session using `session.viewer()`. This will open a new browser tab with the session in action.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the `session.viewer_cdp()` method to open Chrome CDP viewer.


## Manage your agents

```python
from notte_sdk.client import NotteClient
import os

notte = NotteClient()
# start an agent
agent = notte.Agent(max_steps=10)
response = agent.run(
    task="Summarize the job offers on the Notte careers page.",
    url="https://notte.cc",
)
# get session replay
replay = agent.replay()
```

Note that starting an agent also starts a session which is automatically stopped when the agent completes its tasks (or is stopped).

You can use a non blocking approach to control the execution flow using the `agent.start(...)`, `agent.status(...)` and `agent.stop(...)` methods.


## Execute actions in a session

The notte sdk also allows you to `observe` a web page and its actions, `scrape` the page content as well as `execute` actions in a running session.

```python
from notte_sdk.client import NotteClient
import os
notte = NotteClient(api_key=os.getenv("NOTTE_API_KEY"))

# start a session
with notte.Session() as session:
    # observe a web page
    result = session.execute({"type": "goto", "url": "https://www.google.com"})
    obs = session.observe()
    # select random id to click
    action = obs.space.sample(type="click")
    result = session.execute(action)
    # scrape the page content
    markdown = session.scrape()
    print(markdown)
    # print the scraped content)
    agent = notte.Agent(session=session)
    response =agent.run(
        task="Summarize the content of the page",
        url="https://www.google.com",
    )
    print(response.answer)
```
