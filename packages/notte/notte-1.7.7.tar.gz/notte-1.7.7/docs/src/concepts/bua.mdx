## Overview

Browser-Using Agent echoes the [Computer-Using Agent (CUA)](https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/) model popularized by OpenAI but extends it to browser environments.

Traditional OpenAI-like CUA models usually combine vision capabilities of LLMs and reasoning systems to simulate controlling computer interfaces and perform tasks.
Browser-Using Agents focus *exclusively* on the browser as the primitive interface for the agent to interact with.
The reason for this is that browsers are a special type of computer interface where the performance of AI agents can be greatly improved by being given access to the DOM of the page.

BUA is available through the `bua/completions` endpoint.

## How it works

Input-wise, on top of the traditional CUA Screenshot + Prompt approach, BUA also leverages the DOM of the page for improved understanding and reasoning of web pages. This is explained in the figure below.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send a request to `bua/completions`">
    Include the computer tool as part of the available tools, specifying the display size and environment. You can also include in the first request a screenshot of the initial state of the environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive a response from the BUA model">
    The response will contain a list of actions to take to make progress towards the specified goal. These actions could be clicking at a given position, typing in text, scrolling, or even waiting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute the requested action">
    Execute through code the corresponding action on your browser environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Capture the updated state">
    After executing the action, capture the updated state of the environment as a screenshot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat">
    Send a new request with the updated state as a computer_call_output, and repeat this loop until the model stops requesting actions or you decide to stop.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting up your environment

Before you can use BUA, you require a browser environment that can capture screenshots and DOM snapshots of a given web page. We advise using `playwright` for this purpose.

You can check out the [bua-playwright](https://github.com/nottelabs/bua/blob/main/src/bua/computers/shared/base_playwright.py) library for an example implementation, in particular:

* `computer.screenshot()`
* `computer.dom()`

## Integrating the BUA loop

### 1. Send a request to the model

The first request will contain the initial state of the environment, which is a screenshot of the page and the DOM of the page.
```python
from notte import NotteClient

notte = NotteClient()

# only for reference, this response will not work
response = notte.bua.responses.create(
    params=[{
        "display_width": 1024,
        "display_height": 768,
    }],
    input=[
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "text": "Check the latest job offers on the careers page of notte.cc."
            },
            {
              "type": "input_image",
              "image_url": f"data:image/png;base64,{screenshot_base64}"
            },
            {
              "type": "input_dom_json",
              "dom_tree": f"\{<DOM_TREE>\}"
            }
          ]
        }
    ],
)

print(response.output)
```

### 2. Receive a suggested action

The response will contain a list of actions to take to make progress towards the specified goal. These actions could be clicking at a given position, typing in text, scrolling, or even waiting.

```json
{
  "type": "browser_call",
  "id": "9e59fa10-9261-4c8b-a89a-7bfbeae26eda",
  "call_id": "f8c96d4a-d424-4047-9e8b-4d83d292e749",
  "state": {
    "previous_goal_status": "unknown",
    "previous_goal_eval": "I have successfully navigated to the website notte.cc.",
    "page_summary": "The page is the homepage of Notte, a web agent framework. It has links to Product, Use Cases, Pricing, Docs, and Careers. It also has buttons to Sign Up, Get started for free, and Book a demo.",
    "relevant_interactions": [
      {
        "id": "L5",
        "reason": "The link L5 leads to the careers page, where I can find the jobs offered by Notte."
      }
    ],
    "memory": "Navigated to notte.cc",
    "next_goal": "Find the jobs offered by Notte."
  },
  "action": {
    "id": "L5",
    "selectors": {
      "css_selector": "html > body > div > header > div > div > div:nth-of-type(2) > nav > a:nth-of-type(4).text-base.font-normal.text-muted-foreground.transition-colors[target=\"_blank\"][href=\"https://nottelabs.notion.site/jobs-for-humans\"]",
      "xpath_selector": "html/body/div/header/div/div/div[2]/nav/a[4]",
      "notte_selector": "",
      "in_iframe": false,
      "in_shadow_root": false,
      "iframe_parent_css_selectors": [],
      "playwright_selector": null
    },
    "type": "click"
  }
}
```

### 3. Execute the action in your environment

How you map a browser call to actions through code depends on your environment. If you are using `playwright` as your browser automation library, we already have a library that maps the browser calls to playwright actions:

[bua-playwright-agent](https://github.com/nottelabs/bua/blob/main/src/bua/agent/agent.py).
