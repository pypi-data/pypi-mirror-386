## How it works

![persona-workflow](/images/persona-workflow.png)

Personas act as complete digital identities that your AI agents can assume during execution. When an agent needs to create an account or authenticate with a service, it uses the persona's credentials and communication channels to complete the entire flow autonomously.

The persona system integrates with both the browser session and the secure vault, allowing agents to:
1. Fill registration forms with persona details
2. Receive and read verification emails automatically
3. Handle SMS-based 2FA codes
4. Store generated passwords and tokens securely

This creates a seamless experience where agents can navigate complex authentication flows without breaking execution to wait for human intervention.

## Use Cases

### Account Creation Workflows
Personas excel at automating account registration across multiple platforms:
- **SaaS Signups**: Automatically create accounts on software platforms
- **E-commerce**: Register for shopping sites and marketplaces
- **Social Media**: Set up profiles across social networks
- **Financial Services**: Complete KYC and account opening processes
- **QA Testing**: Generate test accounts for quality assurance

## Security & Privacy

- 🔒 Each persona operates in complete isolation
- 🔒 Communication channels are encrypted and secure
- 🔒 Optional integration with Notte's secure vault system
- 🔒 Automatic cleanup and data retention policies
- 🔒 Full audit trail of persona activities

<Tip>
Personas are designed to work seamlessly with Notte's existing vault system. You can create a persona with an associated vault to store any credentials generated during account creation, ensuring they're available for future agent sessions.

<Warning>
Personas should be used responsibly and in compliance with the terms of service of the platforms your agents interact with. Ensure your use cases align with platform policies and applicable regulations.
