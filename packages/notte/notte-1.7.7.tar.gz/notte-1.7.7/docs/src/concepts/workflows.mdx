## Overview

Workflows enable hybrid automation by combining the precision of scripting with the adaptability of AI agents. They allow you to script the predictable parts of your automation while leveraging agents only when needed, resulting in more reliable and cost-effective automations.

<Note>
Notte workflows are simple python scripts that can be executed both locally and in the cloud.
