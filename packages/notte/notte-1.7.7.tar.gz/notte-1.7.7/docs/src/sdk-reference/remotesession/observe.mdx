**Observation Response:**
- a list of actions that can be taken on the page (e.g. click on a button, scroll, etc.)
- a screenshot of the page (base64 encoded)
- some metadata about the page (title, url, etc.)

```python
# Observe the page
obs = session.observe()
# Select an action from the list of interactible elements on the page
actions = obs.space.interaction_actions
# display the action space as a string to be able to visualize it
print(obs.space.description)
# get the screenshot
screenshot = obs.screenshot.bytes()
```

Once you have selected an action (either manually or using an LLM), you can execute it with:
```python
session.execute(action)
```

Note that by default, a very simple page perception is used to generate the action space (i.e `perception_type='fast'`) to make the query fast.
If you want a more powerful and LLM-ready action space, you can use:

```python
obs = session.observe(perception_type='deep')
print(obs.space.description)
```

At the cost of a slower query since this uses an LLM call to format the interactive elements.

Additionally, you can use the `instructions` parameter to narrow down the action space to a specific intent on a website. This is useful if you want to quickly create a workflow using natural language:

```python
_ = session.execute({"type": "goto", "url": "https://console.notte.cc"})
obs = session.observe(instructions="Fill the email input")
action = obs.space.first()
print(action.model_dump())
```




## Parameters

<ParamField path="min_nb_actions" type="int | None">
  The minimum number of actions to list before stopping. If not provided, the listing will continue until the maximum number of actions is reached.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="max_nb_actions" type="int">
  The maximum number of actions to list after which the listing will stop. Used when min_nb_actions is not provided.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="url" type="str | None">
  The URL to observe. If not provided, uses the current page URL.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="instructions" type="str | None">
  Additional instructions to use for the observation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="perception_type" type="typing.Optional[typing.Literal['fast', 'deep']]">
</ParamField>
