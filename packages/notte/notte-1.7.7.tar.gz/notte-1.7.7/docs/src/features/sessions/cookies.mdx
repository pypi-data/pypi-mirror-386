## Overview

Cookies provide a flexible way to authenticate your sessions in Notte. While we recommend using the secure vault for credential management, cookies offer an alternative approach that might be more convenient for certain use cases.

## Uploading Cookies to Your Session

Here's how to upload cookies to your Notte session:

<UploadCookies/>

### Important Notes
- The cookies file must be a valid JSON file
- Cookies are available for all sessions started after upload
- You need to manage cookie expiration manually
- Upload new cookies when they expire
