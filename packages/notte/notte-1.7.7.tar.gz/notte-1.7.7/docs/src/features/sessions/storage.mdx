## Overview

File Storage allows you to upload files to a session and download files that agents retrieve during their work. When uploading a file, it becomes available to agents in that session. When agents download files from websites, you can retrieve those files later.

<Info>
File Storage is session-scoped - all agents within a session share the same S3 bucket. Files persist beyond the session lifecycle so you can retrieve downloads later.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. **Upload files** → Files are stored in the session's S3 bucket
2. **Run agents** → Agents can use uploaded files and download new ones
3. **Download results** → Retrieve files that agents downloaded

<Warning>
Agents can only see **filenames** of uploaded files, not their content. Use descriptive names like `resume_john_doe.pdf` to make sure they get the right context!
</Warning>

## Basic Usage

<FileStorageBasic />

## Upload Files

Upload files before running your agents:

<FileStorageUpload />

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive filenames (agents only see the filename)
- Large files are supported (AWS S3 limits apply)

## Download Files

After agents complete their work, download files they retrieved:

<FileStorageDownload />

## File Persistence

- **Session Duration**: Files are available throughout the session and persist after it ends
- **Agent Sharing**: Multiple agents in the same session share the same storage
- **Persistence**: Files remain available for download even after the session closes
