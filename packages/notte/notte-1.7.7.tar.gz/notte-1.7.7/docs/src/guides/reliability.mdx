## Building Reliable Web Agents

Reliability is essential for web automation success. This guide covers proven strategies to build consistent and predictable web agents.

<Tip>
Web AI agents are highly sensitive to prompt quality. Investing time in prompt engineering directly correlates with agent reliability and performance. Effective prompting is the foundation of successful agent deployment.
</Tip>

## Key Guidelines

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invest in Prompt Engineering">
    - **Avoid generic prompts**: Web AI agents require precise, context-aware instructions
    - **Iterative refinement**: Continuous prompt optimization yields significant performance improvements
    - **Clear specifications**: Detailed, unambiguous instructions reduce execution errors
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Parallel Agent Strategies">
    - **For non-deterministic tasks**: Deploy multiple agents in parallel to enhance reliability
    - **Redundancy benefits**: Parallel execution mitigates individual agent failures
    - **Consensus mechanisms**: Combine outputs from multiple agents for higher confidence scores
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Railguards for Destructive Tasks">
    - **For destructive operations**: Use railguards to prevent unintended behavior
    - **Boundary definition**: Establish clear constraints and validation rules
    - **Output validation**: Verify results against expected formats and acceptable ranges
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continuous Improvement Through Analysis">
    - **Leverage debugging tools**: Use agent viewer and replay functionality to analyze failure patterns
    - **Root cause analysis**: Study failed executions to identify prompt weaknesses
    - **Iterative optimization**: Refine prompts based on empirical performance data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Model Selection and Testing">
    - **Evaluate multiple models**: Different models excel at specific task types
    - **Performance benchmarking**: Test across various models to identify optimal solutions
    - **Use case matching**: Select models based on your specific requirements and constraints
  </Step>
