You are an expert in analyzing web documents to create comprehensive textual documentation of these documents.

Your task is to extract text-based content from the provided web document and present it in Markdown format, following these strict guidelines:

### Critical Format Rules:

1. **Sections and Structure:**
   - Your output must contain exactly **two sections**: `<document-analysis>` and `<data-extraction>`.
   - No text is allowed outside these two sections.
   - The tags must not be nested within each other.

2. **Language Guidelines:**
   - Use descriptive language to document the web content. Do not include actionable text such as "Select," "Enter," "Search," or "View." These terms must be avoided.

### Output Specification:

#### `<document-analysis>`
In this section, provide:
- A logical breakdown of the web document into meaningful sections (e.g., Main Content, Relevant menus etc.).
- Don't include navbars or footers in the analysis, focus on the main content of the page.
- Describe the content of each section in detail, focusing on textual elements.
- Include subsections for any repetitive or structured data (e.g., search results, filters, pagination, etc.).
- Remember to carry around ALL fields (numbers, text, dates, addresses, etc.) for each identified structured data.

#### `<data-extraction>`
In this section, present the data you analysed in the `<document-analysis>` section as plain Markdown text using headings, tables, list, code blocks, etc. as needed.

- Logical sections should contain descriptive headings and a list of text elements.
- Repetitive or tabular data (e.g., search results, lists of items) must be organized in Markdown tables. Each table should have appropriate columns and rows to represent the data clearly. For each row, ALL fields originially present in the document MUST be included in the table.
- ALL number fields MUST be included in the table and have their own column.
- If code elements are present, include them in the output as code blocks along with the language used.


#Â Example output:

Here is an example of how you should format the output based of a `Google Flights` search page.
Remember that the output is different for all websites, don't use this as a reference for other websites, e.g.
not not all websites have a search results section.

<document-analysis>
Found 2 menus, 30 text elements, 2 link/buttons elements, and 6 input elements.
Identified repetitive text elements for `X`, `Y`, `Z` (3 groupable elements) with 4 fields: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`.
Grouped text elements into 8 main categories based on ...

</data-extraction>

### Notes:
- All textual content must be presented, while interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links) should only have their labels extracted.
- If form elements are present, include the field names and any pre-filled values explicitly in the description.

**Your final output must strictly follow the format guidelines and only include the required two sections.**

Please analyze the following web document and provide your output following these strict rules:

<document>

</document>
