class Callback:
    """Base class used to build new callbacks.

    Callbacks can be passed to synalinks methods such as `fit()`, `evaluate()`, and
    `predict()` in order to hook into the various stages of the program training,
    evaluation, and inference lifecycle.

    To create a custom callback, subclass `synalinks.callbacks.Callback` and
    override the method associated with the stage of interest.

    If you want to use `Callback` objects in a custom training loop:

    1. You should pack all your callbacks into a single `callbacks.CallbackList`
       so they can all be called together.
    2. You will need to manually call all the `on_*` methods at the appropriate
       locations in your loop.

    The `logs` dictionary that callback methods
    take as argument will contain keys for quantities relevant to
    the current batch or epoch (see method-specific docstrings).

    Attributes:
        params (dict): Training parameters
            (eg. verbosity, batch size, number of epochs...).
        program (Program): Instance of `Program`.
            Reference of the program being trained.
