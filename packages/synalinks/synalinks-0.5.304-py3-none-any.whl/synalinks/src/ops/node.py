class Node:
    """A `Node` describes an operation `__call__()` event.

    A Synalinks Function is a DAG with `Node` instances as nodes, and
    `SymbolicDataModel` instances as edges. Nodes aren't `Operation` instances,
    because a single operation could be called multiple times, which would
    result in graph cycles.

    A `__call__()` event involves input data_models (and other input arguments),
    the operation that was called, and the resulting output data_models.
    A `Node` will include all this information.

    Since a single `Operation` could be called multiple times,
    the `Node` instances are stored on operations as a list.
    Each time an operation is called, a node is added to `op._inbound_nodes`.
    Each time the output of an operation is used by another operation,
    a node is added to `op._outbound_nodes`.

    Every `SymbolicDataModel` instance has a `synalinksHistory` object attached,
    which tracks the `Node` that records the `__call__()` event that created
    the data_model. By recursively walking through `Node` instances
    via the `KerasHistory` metadata of `SymbolicDataModel` instances, once can
    retrieve the entire DAG of a synalinks Function.

    Args:
        operation (Operation): The Operation that was called in the `op.__call__()`
            event that this node represents.
        call_arg (positional arguments): The positional arguments the operation was
            called with.
        call_kwargs (keyword arguments): The keyword arguments the operation was
            called with.
        outputs (list): The output data models of the `op.__call__()` call.
