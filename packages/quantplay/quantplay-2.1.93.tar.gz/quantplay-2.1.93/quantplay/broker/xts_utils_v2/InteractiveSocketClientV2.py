class OrderSocket_io_V2(socketio.Client):
    """A Socket.IO client.
    This class implements a fully compliant Socket.IO web client with support
    for websocket and long-polling transports.
    :param reconnection: 'True'. if the client should automatically attempt to
                         reconnect to the server after an interruption, or
                         'False' to not reconnect. The default is 'True'.
    :param reconnection_attempts: How many reconnection attempts to issue
                                  before giving up, or 0 for infinity attempts.
                                  The default is 0.
    :param reconnection_delay: How long to wait in seconds before the first
                               reconnection attempt. Each successive attempt
                               doubles this delay.
    :param reconnection_delay_max: The maximum delay between reconnection
                                   attempts.
    :param randomization_factor: Randomization amount for each delay between
                                 reconnection attempts. The default is 0.5,
                                 which means that each delay is randomly
                                 adjusted by +/- 50%.
    :param logger: To enable logging set to 'True' or pass a logger object to
                   use. To disable logging set to 'False'. The default is
                   'False'.
    :param binary: 'True' to support binary payloads, 'False' to treat all
                   payloads as text. On Python 2, if this is set to 'True',
                   'unicode' values are treated as text, and 'str' and
                   'bytes' values are treated as binary.  This option has no
                   effect on Python 3, where text and binary payloads are
                   always automatically discovered.
    :param json: An alternative json module to use for encoding and decoding
                 packets. Custom json modules must have 'dumps' and 'loads'
                 functions that are compatible with the standard library
                 versions.
