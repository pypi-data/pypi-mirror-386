# ðŸ“Œ Welcome to the Picsellia CV Engine Docs

**Picsellia CV Engine** is a modular toolkit for building, testing, and deploying computer vision pipelines â€” all fully integrated with [Picsellia](https://picsellia.com). Whether you're processing datasets, training models, or deploying experiments, this engine helps you structure everything in a clean, reusable way.


## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s a pipeline?

A **pipeline** is a sequence of steps that defines how data flows â€” from raw inputs to final results.

In **Picsellia CV Engine**, pipelines are used for both:

- **Training pipelines**:

    Load training datasets, configure a model, run training, log results and export weights.

- **Processing pipelines**:

    Clean or filter datasets, apply data augmentation, run inference for pre-annotation, or convert formats.

Each unit of work is a step â€” a standalone function decorated with @step. You can reuse, extend, or combine steps freely depending on your needs.
## âœ¨ Key features
- **Composable Steps** â€“ Use or customize ready-made steps for common operations (loading data, training, etc.)
- **Training Pipelines** â€“ Structure model training (e.g. Ultralytics YOLO) with built-in logic
- **Processing Pipelines** â€“ Clean, transform, or validate datasets before use
- **Framework Extensions** â€“ Support custom training libraries via a pluggable architecture
- **CLI Automation** â€“ Use `pxl-pipeline` cli to scaffold, test, and deploy pipelines locally or on Picsellia
