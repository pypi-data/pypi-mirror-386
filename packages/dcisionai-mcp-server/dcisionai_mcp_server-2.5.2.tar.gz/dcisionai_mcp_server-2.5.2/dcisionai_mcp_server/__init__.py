DcisionAI MCP Server - Optimization Intelligence for AI Workflows

This package provides optimization capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP),
enabling AI agents to solve complex optimization problems across multiple industries.

Key Features:
- 7 Industry Workflows: Manufacturing, Healthcare, Retail, Marketing, Financial, Logistics, Energy
- Qwen 30B Integration: Advanced mathematical optimization
- Real-Time Results: Actual optimization solutions with mathematical proofs
- MCP Protocol: Seamless integration with AI development environments

Example Usage:
    from dcisionai_mcp_server import mcp
    
    # Execute a manufacturing optimization workflow
    result = mcp.execute_workflow(
        industry="manufacturing",
        workflow_id="production_planning"
    )
