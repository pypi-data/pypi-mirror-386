"""Python bindings for the libeismultiplexer library.

This package provides a thin wrapper around the native ``libeismultiplexer`` C
library, exposing a :class:`Multiplexer` class and several enumerations that
represent channels, trigger states and wait types.  The underlying C library is
loaded via ``ctypes`` and the highâ€‘level API is implemented in C++ using
``pybind11`` (see :mod:`_core`).

Typical usage::

    from libeismultiplexer import Multiplexer, Channel, TriggerState

    mux = Multiplexer(serial=0)
    mux.connectChannel(Channel.A)
    mux.setTriggerState(0, TriggerState.HIGH)

The module ensures that the required ``libusb-1.0`` shared library is present
on the system before importing the compiled extension.
