# Custom Thresholds Configuration
# Fine-tuned for specific use cases

project:
  name: my_custom_project
  
  # Infrastructure
  broker: redis
  database: postgres
  storage: minio
  
  # Observability - SELECTIVE
  tracing: true           # Keep tracing for debugging
  metrics: true           # Keep metrics for monitoring
  large_response_storage: true  # But with custom threshold
  
  # Custom storage threshold (only store REALLY large responses)
  storage_threshold_kb: 500  # 500KB threshold instead of 100KB
  
  agents:
    - researcher
    - writer

# This configuration is useful when:
# - You want observability but have bandwidth concerns
# - Your responses are typically medium-sized (100-500KB)
# - You want to minimize MinIO usage

# Environment variables:
# STORAGE_THRESHOLD_KB=500
