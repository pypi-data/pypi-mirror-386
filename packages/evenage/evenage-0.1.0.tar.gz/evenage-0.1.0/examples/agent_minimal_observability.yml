# Observability Configuration - ALL DISABLED
# This agent's operations are not traced or metered
observability:
  enable_tracing: false        # No traces
  enable_metrics: false        # No metrics
  store_large_responses: false # Always inline

# Use cases for disabled observability:
# - Internal/utility agents
# - High-frequency, low-value operations
# - Sensitive operations that shouldn't be logged
# - Performance-critical paths
