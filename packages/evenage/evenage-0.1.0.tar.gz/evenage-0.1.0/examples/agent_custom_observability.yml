# Observability Configuration - SELECTIVE
# This agent produces large outputs, so we customize storage
observability:
  enable_tracing: true    # Keep tracing for debugging
  enable_metrics: true    # Keep metrics for monitoring
  
  # But store even small responses since this agent produces lots of text
  store_large_responses: true
  storage_threshold_kb: 50   # Lower threshold (50KB instead of 100KB)
