Welcome to the `dmqclib` documentation!
=======================================

``dmqclib`` is a Python library that provides a configuration-driven workflow for machine learning, simplifying dataset preparation, model training, and data classification. It is a core component of the AIQC project.

The library is designed around a three-stage workflow:

1.  **Dataset Preparation:** Prepare feature datasets from raw data and generate training, validation, and test data sets.
2.  **Training & Evaluation:** Train machine learning models and evaluate their performance using cross-validation.
3.  **Classification:** Apply a trained model to classify new, unseen data.

Each stage is controlled by a YAML configuration file, allowing you to define and reproduce your entire workflow with ease.

.. note::
   To unlock the full potential of your model building processes, comprehensive configuration is key. For a streamlined initial test or to explore the library with base settings, see the :doc:`how-to/quick_start` guide.
