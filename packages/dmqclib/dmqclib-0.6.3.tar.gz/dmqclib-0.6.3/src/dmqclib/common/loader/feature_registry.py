"""
Module defining the global registry for feature classes.

This module provides ``FEATURE_REGISTRY``, a central mapping of string
identifiers to specific feature-extraction classes within the `dmqclib`
pipeline. Each entry allows for dynamic loading and instantiation of
feature generators based on configuration settings, facilitating the
preparation of datasets by applying various data transformations and
extractions.
