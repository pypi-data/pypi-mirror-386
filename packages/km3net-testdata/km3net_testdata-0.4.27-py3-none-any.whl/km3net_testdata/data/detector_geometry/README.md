# Detector geometry files

This sample of files illustrate a "full" detector geometry, with
modules position, T-bar attachment on the anchor (floor == 0), the
acoustic emitters as well as the hydrophones.

## Provenance

These files are coming from the [git
archive](https://git.km3net.de/auxiliary_data/calibration) and
contains the geometry of D0ARCA030 (detid=232). They are the result of
the calibration v1.1.3. More details about the full archive version in
the next part.

## Files descrition

- `KM3NeT_00000232.detector.datx` which contains the DOMs positions as well as the floor 0 (anchor). This is the result of `G_DOM_1.1.3`
- `KM3NeT_00000232.hydrophone.txt` which contains the position of the anchor-attached hydrophones.
- `KM3NeT_00000232.transmitter.txt` which contains the position of the anchor-attached acoustic beacons.
- `KM3NeT_00000232.tripod.txt` which contains the position of the others acoustic emitters.
- `KM3NeT_00000232.waveform.txt` which contains the mapping between the acoustic emitters and their attached waveforms.
