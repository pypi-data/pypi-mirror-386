# benchmark table from http://antares-wiki.in2p3.fr/doku.php?id=benchmarks_astro
# The following table lists the coordinates of 4 different celestial objects as rightascension (RA) and declination (DEC) specified for epoch 2000.0 as it is conventionally done in many catalogues. The benchmark consists in the calculation of the direction (as reconstructed by Antares) of a particle coming from these objects at the 2 different observation dates. 
# values were obtained with astro on 2010-07-15, svn revision 5525
# theta, phi: track in horiz. UTM [deg]
# zenith, azimuth: Source in horiz. UTM [deg]
# DEC-J2000 [gg:mm:ss] / RA-J2000 [hh:mm:ss.d]: source in equatorial coos.
