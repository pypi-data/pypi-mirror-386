Installation
============

The Splunk SOAR Apps SDK is useful both as a CLI tool, for creating and managing Splunk SOAR apps, and as a Python library for building such apps. In both cases, the preferred installation method is via ``uv``. This section covers the installation steps for the SDK as a CLI tool. The CLI tool can be used to quickly initialize a new Splunk SOAR app project, which will automatically depend on the SDK library.


Prerequisites
-------------

- A Mac or Linux machine. Windows is not supported.
- Git installed and available in your PATH.
- `uv <https://docs.astral.uv/>`_: the Python version and environment manager used by the SDK.
- It's recommended to also install ``ruff`` and ``pre-commit``, as these are often used when building Splunk SOAR apps:
    .. code-block:: bash

        uv tool install ruff
        uv tool install pre-commit --with pre-commit-uv


Installing the SDK as a Tool
----------------------------

The SDK can be installed and used as a command-line interface (CLI) tool, accessible via the ``soarapps`` command. This allows you to create, test, and manage Splunk SOAR apps directly from your terminal. To install the CLI tool, use the following command:
    .. code-block:: bash

        uv tool install splunk-soar-sdk

Once installed, you can access the CLI using the command:
    .. code-block:: bash

        soarapps --help

This provides a range of commands to help you develop and manage your Splunk SOAR apps efficiently. A full reference is available in the :ref:`CLI Reference <cli_reference>` section of this documentation.
