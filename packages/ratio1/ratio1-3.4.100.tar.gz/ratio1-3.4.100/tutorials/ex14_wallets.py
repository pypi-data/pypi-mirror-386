This demo showcases the SDK's ability to enable the sending and receiving of both ETH and $R1 tokens. 
The script checks balances, waits until some ETH and $R1 are available for distribution, and then 
proceeds to distribute randomized amounts of ETH and $R1 to multiple peers. 

Along the way, it logs transaction details and updates the balances of both the client and the recipient 
addresses, ensuring smooth interaction with the Ethereum network and $R1 token. for a few seconds
This  demo showcases the SDK (and R1 Edge Node) ability  for managing ETH and $R1 tokens in a live environment. 

With just a few lines of code, the tutorial demonstrates how to:
 - Monitor Balances: Continuously check and wait for the client's ETH and $R1 balances to become available.
 - Automate Distribution: Randomly calculate and distribute tokens to multiple peer addresses.
 - Transaction Handling: Seamlessly send transactions with built-in logging, gas fee checks, and receipt 
   verification on testnet or devnet networks.

Its a hands-on, real-world example of how you can effortlessly integrate token transfers into 
your R1 applications.
