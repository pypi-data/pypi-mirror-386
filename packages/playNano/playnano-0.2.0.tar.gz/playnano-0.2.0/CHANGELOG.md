## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0]

This release introduces video processing, stack editing, multi-version documentation, and major CLI enhancements.

### Added

- **Documentation**
  - New **Exporting Data** page (`docs/exporting.rst`) covering OME-TIFF, NPZ, HDF5, and GIF export formats
    with CLI and Python examples.
  - New **Processing Operations Reference** page (`docs/processing-operations-reference.rst`) listing all
    built-in filters, masks, and stack/video operations with parameters.
  - Added version-switcher support for Sphinx with:
    - `docs/_static/version-switcher.js` and `version-switcher.css`.
    - Sidebar template `docs/_templates/sidebar/versions.html`.
  - New `versions.json` generation and ‚Äústable‚Äù alias logic in docs build workflow.
  - Support for multi-version documentation builds via `sphinx-multiversion`.
  - Added project version/commit metadata injection to Sphinx `conf.py`.

- **Codebase**
  - `AFMImageStack` now registers and resolves new processing groups:
    - `video_processing` and `stack_edit` modules added.
  - Added internal state backup mechanism (`state_backups` attribute) for preserving
    origonal metadata.
  - Moved the versioning module for funcitons from the processing subpakage to the utils subpackage.

- **Docs Generation**
  - Automatic inclusion of `playNano.analysis.utils.loader`, `playNano.processing.video_processing`, and
    `playNano.processing.stack_edit` in the API reference.

- **GitHub**
  - Issue templates added for bug reports and feature requests.

### Changed

- **Documentation**
  - Documents and docstrings updated to correct typos address sphinx build warnings.
  - Instructions for installation from PyPi to the user docs.
  - Clearer instruction for the installation procedure to use notebooks added.
  - Major re-write of `processing.rst`:
    - Expanded explanation of pipeline structure, operation types, and provenance tracking.
    - Improved CLI/GUI examples, programmatic usage, and plugin registration guidance.
    - `index.rst`, `introduction.rst`, `gui.rst`, and `quickstart.rst` updated with links to new
      **Exporting** and **Processing Operations Reference** pages.
    - `analysis.rst` fixed Sphinx link formatting.
    - Improved generated module list formatting for analysis modules.
    - Updated Sphinx `conf.py` to:
      - Support multi-version builds, version detection, and sidebar switcher.
      - Move `src` path resolution to a relative form.
      - Reorganize theme and HTML sidebar configuration.
    - Added `sphinx-multiversion` to `pyproject.toml` under `[project.optional-dependencies.docs]`.

- **GitHub Actions**
  - Overhauled `docs.yaml` workflow:
    - Builds and deploys versioned docs on `main` and release tags.
    - Adds PR preview artifact upload.
    - Generates `versions.json` and root redirect index.
    - Creates ‚Äústable‚Äù alias for latest release.
  - Renamed job to ‚ÄúBuild and Deploy Docs‚Äù.

  - **Notebooks**
    - Added a root search function so hard coded paths to demo data from the tests folder
      can be accessed whereever jupyter is launched from.

### Fixed

- **Documentation**
  - Corrected malformed Sphinx links and build warnings across multiple pages.
  - Improved auto-generated module list formatting and spacing.

## [0.1.0.post1] - 2025-10-14

### Changed

- **GitHub**
  - Add workflows for pypi publishing

- **Documentation**
  - Add badges for tests, PyPi python versino and PyPi relases.
  - Added links to the documentation and user guide on github pages.
  - Added a PyPi installation guide to the README and user guide.
  - Some general rewriting and improvements

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-17

### Added

- First public release üéâ

- **AFM data loading & playback**
  - Load HS‚ÄëAFM videos from .h5-jpk and .asd files and folders of .spm and .jpk files.
  - Time‚Äëaware frame navigation and consistent pixel/scale metadata.

- **Processing pipeline with masks & full provenance**
  - Sequential filters and masks (e.g., plane removal, row/median alignment, polynomial flatten, Gaussian filtering).
  - Each step is recorded with index, name, parameters, timestamps, and environment details under `stack.provenance`.
  - Processed snapshots and masks are stored with ordered keys like `step_<n>_<name>` for reliable inspection and re‚Äëuse.

- **Reproducible export & re‚Äëimport (analysis‚Äëready)**
  - Save the current stack state (with stages, masks, and provenance) to **HDF5 (`.h5`)** or **NumPy bundles (`.npz`)**.
  - Re‚Äëload bundles later to continue processing and run analyses with the full history intact.
  - Export to **OME‚ÄëTIFF** for interoperability and to **GIF** (with optional scale bars)
    for quick sharing and presentation.

- **Interactive GUI (PySide6) for exploration**
  - Real‚Äëtime playback, frame seeking, and snapshot previews.
  - **Z‚Äërange control** (auto or manual) to maintain consistent height scaling across frames.
  - **Annotations/overlays** (i.e. timestamps, raw data label, scale bar) rendered on top of frames.
  - Built‚Äëin dark theme stylesheet for high‚Äëcontrast analysis.

- **Analysis framework**
  - Build analysis pipelines from built-in and pluggable analysis modules.
  - Built-in analysis modules (e.g., LoG blob detection, DBSCAN/K‚ÄëMeans/X‚ÄëMeans clustering, particle tracking).
  - Produces labeled masks, per‚Äëfeature properties (area, min/max/mean, bbox, centroid), and summary statistics.
  - Analysis outputs are keyed and traced in provenance for reproducibility.

- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
  - `playnano` entrypoint to run processing pipelines, export bundles (TIFF/NPZ/HDF5), and create GIFs from the shell.

- **Notebooks**
  - Jupyter notebooks included to demonstrate programmatic workflow.
  - Overview notebook covers the whole loading, processing, analysis and export workflow.
  - Processing notebook focuses on processing and export of loaded data.

- **Documentation**:
  - Created a Sphinx documentation site on GitHub Pages.
  - **User Guide** covering installation, quick start, GUI and CLI usage, processing, analysis and exports.
  - **API Reference** generated with `sphinx-autoapi` for all packages.
  - **CLI reference** with examples and typical workflows.
  - Furo theme and MyST Markdown configuration for a clean, consistent look.
