# webbed_duck

`webbed_duck` turns Markdown + SQL route files into HTTP endpoints powered by DuckDB.

This MVP (v0.3) extends the core compiler and server with annotation-ready viewers and workflow helpers:

* A Markdown compiler that translates `*.sql.md` files into Python route manifests and preserves per-route metadata for cards,
  feeds, charts, overrides, and append targets.
* A FastAPI-based server that executes DuckDB queries per-request, applies per-cell overrides from the overlay store, and
  returns JSON payloads derived from Arrow tables, HTML tables (`html_t`), card grids (`html_c`), feed views, and Arrow stream
  slices for virtualized viewers.
* New endpoints for `/routes/{id}/schema`, `/routes/{id}/overrides`, and `/routes/{id}/append` to expose form metadata, manage
  overrides, and persist CSV append operations.
* Popularity analytics, folder indexes, and a pluggable auth adapter resolved via configuration.
* Command-line tooling for compiling routes, running the development server, and iterating cursor-driven workloads via
  `run-incremental`.

See `routes_src/hello.sql.md` for an example route.

## Usage

Compile routes:

```bash
python -m webbed_duck.cli compile --source routes_src --build routes_build
```

Run the development server (requires the compiled routes):

```bash
python -m webbed_duck.cli serve --build routes_build --config config.toml
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello?name=DuckDB` to exercise the sample route. Append `&format=html_c` or `&format=feed` to
see the HTML viewers, or `&format=arrow&limit=25` for Arrow RPC slices. Use `POST /routes/hello/overrides` to annotate rows,
`POST /routes/hello/append` to persist CSV records, and `GET /routes/hello/schema` to generate auto-form metadata.
