"I’m planning a 5-day trip to Kyoto to immerse myself in its rich culture, historic temples, and serene gardens. I’ll start with a visit to Kiyomizu-dera and stroll through the charming streets of Higashiyama. I’ll explore the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove and relax at a traditional ryokan. On another day, I’ll tour the Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji) and the peaceful Zen gardens at Ryoan-ji. I’m also looking forward to sampling Kyoto’s famous kaiseki cuisine and visiting the Nishiki Market. A day trip to Nara is also on the list!",,"{
