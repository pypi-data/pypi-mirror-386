        self.report_generator = MultimodalReporter()

    async def process(self, text, images):
        # Parallel processing of modalities
        text_features = await self.text_processor.analyze(text)
        image_features = await self.vision_processor.analyze(images)

        # Cross-modal correlation
        correlations = self.correlation_engine.correlate(
            text_features, image_features
        )

        # Integrated report
