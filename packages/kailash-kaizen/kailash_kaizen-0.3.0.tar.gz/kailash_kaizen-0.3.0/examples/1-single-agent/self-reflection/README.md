# Self-Reflection Agent with Error Correction

## Overview
Demonstrates advanced agent capabilities with error correction and self-improvement loops. This agent can evaluate its own responses, identify mistakes, and iteratively improve its outputs through structured reflection patterns.

## Use Case
- Code review and debugging assistance
- Content quality improvement systems
- Educational feedback and tutoring
- Decision validation and refinement

## Agent Specification

### Core Functionality
- **Input**: Task instructions with quality criteria
- **Processing**: Initial response generation followed by self-evaluation
- **Output**: Refined results with improvement history
- **Memory**: Reflection history and improvement patterns

### Signature Pattern
```python
class SelfReflectionSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Generate response with self-evaluation and iterative improvement."""
    task: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Task to complete with quality requirements")
    context: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Additional context or constraints")
    previous_attempts: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Previous attempts and feedback")

    response: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Current best response to the task")
    self_evaluation: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Critical assessment of response quality")
    improvement_areas: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Specific areas needing improvement")
    confidence: float = dspy.OutputField(desc="Confidence in response quality (0.0-1.0)")
    should_iterate: bool = dspy.OutputField(desc="Whether further refinement is needed")
```

## Expected Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Initial Response Generation (0-200ms)
```
[00:00:000] WorkflowBuilder initialized with reflection loop
[00:00:025] Task parsed and quality criteria extracted
[00:00:050] Initial response generation started
[00:00:120] First draft response completed
[00:00:145] Self-evaluation process initiated
[00:00:180] Quality assessment completed
[00:00:200] Iteration decision made
```

### Phase 2: Reflection Loop (200ms-5s)
```
[00:00:200] Iteration 1: Initial response evaluation
{
  "response": "Draft response with potential issues",
  "self_evaluation": "Response lacks specificity in examples, argumentation could be stronger",
  "improvement_areas": "Add concrete examples, strengthen logical flow",
  "confidence": 0.65,
  "should_iterate": true
}

[00:01:200] Iteration 2: Improved response
{
  "response": "Enhanced response with concrete examples",
  "self_evaluation": "Significant improvement in clarity and examples",
  "improvement_areas": "Minor refinements in conclusion",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "should_iterate": true
}

[00:02:800] Iteration 3: Final refinement
{
  "response": "Polished response meeting quality criteria",
  "self_evaluation": "Response meets all quality requirements",
  "improvement_areas": "None identified",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "should_iterate": false
}
```

### Phase 3: Result Compilation (5s-5.2s)
```
[00:05:000] Reflection history compiled
[00:05:050] Improvement trajectory analyzed
[00:05:100] Final response validated
[00:05:150] Learning patterns extracted for future use
[00:05:200] Complete results returned
```

## Architecture Overview

### Agent Coordination Pattern
```
Initial Task → Response Generator → Self Evaluator → Improvement Loop
     ↑                                                      ↓
     ←─────────── Quality Gate ←────────── Refined Response
```

### Data Flow
1. **Task Analysis**: Parse requirements and quality criteria
2. **Response Generation**: Create initial response using LLM
3. **Self-Evaluation**: Critical assessment of response quality
4. **Iteration Decision**: Determine if improvement needed
5. **Refinement Loop**: Iterative improvement until criteria met
6. **Learning Extraction**: Capture improvement patterns

## Error Scenarios

### Infinite Iteration Loop

}
```

### Quality Regression
```python

  "final_confidence": 0.84,
  "termination_reason": "QUALITY_REGRESSION_DETECTED",
  "note": "Reverted to iteration 2 due to quality decline"
}
```
