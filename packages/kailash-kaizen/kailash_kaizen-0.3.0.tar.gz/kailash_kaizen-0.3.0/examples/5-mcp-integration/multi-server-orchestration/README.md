# Multi-Server MCP Tool Orchestration

## Overview
Demonstrates sophisticated orchestration of multiple MCP servers to create complex, distributed tool ecosystems. This pattern shows how agents can coordinate across heterogeneous tool servers, manage dependencies, handle failures, and optimize execution across distributed infrastructure.

## Use Case
- Complex data pipelines requiring multiple specialized tools
- Cross-platform integrations (databases, APIs, file systems, cloud services)
- Distributed computing workflows with tool dependencies
- Enterprise tool ecosystems with vendor-specific interfaces
- Research workflows requiring diverse computational resources
