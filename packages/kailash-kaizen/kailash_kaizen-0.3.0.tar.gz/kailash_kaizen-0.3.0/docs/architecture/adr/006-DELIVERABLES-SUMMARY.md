## Open Questions

### For Clarification (None)

All requirements, extension points, and migration paths are fully documented.

### For Future Consideration

1. **StreamingStrategy**: Should we implement streaming execution in Phase 1 or later?
   - **Recommendation**: Later (v0.11.0) - focus on SingleShot and MultiCycle first

2. **Additional Mixins**: Which mixins are highest priority?
   - **Current**: Logging, Error, Performance, Batch
   - **Potential**: Caching, RateLimiting, Retry, Monitoring
   - **Recommendation**: Implement current 4 in Phase 4, defer others to v0.11.0

3. **Agent Pooling**: Should we support agent pooling for high-throughput?
   - **Recommendation**: Later (v0.12.0) - optimize single-agent performance first
