# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security practices and policies for the Kaizen AI framework in production environments.

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues to: security@example.com

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)

## Security Features

### Container Security

1. **Non-Root User**
   - All containers run as non-root user (UID 1000)
   - No privilege escalation allowed
   - All Linux capabilities dropped

2. **Read-Only Filesystem**
   - Root filesystem is read-only
   - Writable volumes only for `/tmp` and cache directories
   - Prevents malicious file modifications

3. **Minimal Base Image**
   - Uses Alpine Linux for minimal attack surface
   - Multi-stage builds to exclude build dependencies
   - Regular security scanning with Trivy

### Network Security

1. **Network Policies**
   - Ingress restricted to necessary services only
   - Egress limited to required external services
   - DNS and internal service communication only

2. **TLS Encryption**
   - All external API calls use HTTPS
   - Internal service mesh with mTLS (recommended)
   - Certificate rotation automation

### Secret Management

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**
   - All secrets in Kubernetes Secrets or external secret managers
   - Environment variable injection only
   - Secret rotation support

2. **Recommended Secret Managers**
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - Azure Key Vault
   - GCP Secret Manager
   - Sealed Secrets for GitOps

### Authentication & Authorization

1. **API Authentication**
   - API key authentication for all endpoints
   - JWT tokens with expiration
   - Rate limiting per client

2. **RBAC**
   - Kubernetes RBAC for service accounts
   - Least privilege principle
   - Regular access reviews

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Production

- [ ] All secrets stored in secret manager
- [ ] Container security scanning completed
- [ ] Network policies tested
- [ ] TLS certificates configured
- [ ] Service accounts have minimal permissions
- [ ] Audit logging enabled

### Production

- [ ] Security monitoring active
- [ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Incident response plan documented
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery tested

## Security Scanning

### Container Scanning

```bash
# Scan Docker image
trivy image kaizen:latest

# Scan for high and critical vulnerabilities only
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL kaizen:latest
```

### Dependency Scanning

```bash
# Scan Python dependencies
pip-audit

# Or use safety
safety check
```

### Infrastructure Scanning

```bash
# Scan Kubernetes manifests
kubesec scan k8s/deployment.yaml

# Or use kube-bench
kube-bench run --targets master,node
```

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

- Personal data encryption at rest and in transit
- Data retention policies enforced
- Right to deletion implemented
- Audit logging for data access

### SOC 2 Compliance

- Access controls documented
- Change management process
- Monitoring and alerting
- Incident response procedures

## Security Updates

### Update Policy

- Security patches applied within 24 hours for critical vulnerabilities
- Regular dependency updates monthly
- Base image updates weekly
- Kubernetes version updates quarterly

### Update Process

1. Review security advisories
2. Test updates in staging
3. Deploy to production during maintenance window
4. Verify functionality post-update
5. Document changes

## Incident Response

See `docs/runbooks/incident-response.md` for detailed incident response procedures.

### Severity Levels

- **P0 (Critical)**: Data breach, service down
- **P1 (High)**: Security vulnerability being exploited
- **P2 (Medium)**: Potential vulnerability discovered
- **P3 (Low)**: Security best practice improvement

### Response Times

- P0: Immediate response (15 minutes)
- P1: 1 hour response
- P2: 4 hour response
- P3: 24 hour response
