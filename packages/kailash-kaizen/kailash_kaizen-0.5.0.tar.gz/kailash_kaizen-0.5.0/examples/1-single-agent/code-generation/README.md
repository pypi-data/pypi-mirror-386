### Signature Pattern
```python
class CodeGenerationSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Generate, test, and refine code from natural language specifications."""
    specification: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Natural language code requirements")

## Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **Specification Parser**: Extracts requirements from natural language
2. **Code Generator**: Creates implementations using LLM with code patterns
3. **Test Generator**: Automatically creates comprehensive test suites
4. **Execution Engine**: Runs code in secure sandboxed environment
5. **Quality Analyzer**: Assesses code quality across multiple dimensions
6. **Refinement Controller**: Manages iterative improvement process

### Code Generation Strategies
- **Template-Based**: Uses proven patterns for common implementations
- **Test-Driven**: Generates tests first, then implements to pass tests
- **Incremental**: Builds complex functionality in smaller, testable pieces
- **Pattern Recognition**: Applies learned patterns from successful generations

            'test_coverage': 0.20,
            'documentation': 0.15,
            'performance': 0.20,
            'maintainability': 0.20
        }
