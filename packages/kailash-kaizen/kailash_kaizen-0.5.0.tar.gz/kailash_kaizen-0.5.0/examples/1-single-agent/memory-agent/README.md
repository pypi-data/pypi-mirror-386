# Memory-Augmented Agent with Conversational State

## Overview
Demonstrates persistent memory management for conversational agents. This agent maintains context across multiple interactions, learns from conversation history, and adapts responses based on accumulated knowledge about users and topics.

## Use Case
- Personal assistant applications
- Customer support with conversation history
- Educational tutoring with learning progression
- Long-term relationship building in chatbots

## Agent Specification

### Core Functionality
- **Input**: Messages with conversation context
- **Processing**: Context-aware response generation with memory integration
- **Output**: Responses that reference and build upon conversation history
- **Memory**: Persistent conversation state, user preferences, topic knowledge

### Signature Pattern
```python
class MemoryAgentSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Generate contextually aware responses using conversation memory."""
    current_message: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Current user message")
    conversation_id: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Unique conversation identifier")
    user_id: str = dspy.InputField(desc="User identifier for personalization")

    response: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Contextually appropriate response")
    memory_updates: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Information to store in memory")
    relevance_score: float = dspy.OutputField(desc="Relevance of memory to response")
    emotional_tone: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Detected emotional context")
    next_topic_suggestions: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Suggested conversation directions")
```

## Architecture Overview

### Agent Coordination Pattern
```
User Message → Memory Retrieval → Context Integration → Response Generation
     ↑                                                           ↓
Conversation DB ← Memory Update ← Response Analysis ← Generated Response
```

### Data Flow
1. **Message Reception**: Parse and extract conversation metadata
2. **Memory Retrieval**: Fetch relevant conversation history and user data
3. **Context Assembly**: Integrate memories into coherent context
4. **Response Generation**: Create contextually aware response
5. **Memory Extraction**: Identify new information to remember
6. **Memory Storage**: Update conversation database with new insights

### Memory Schema
```sql
-- Conversation messages
CREATE TABLE conversations (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME,
    message TEXT,
    response TEXT,
    emotion TEXT,
    topics TEXT
);

-- User preferences and characteristics
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    preferences JSON,
    communication_style TEXT,
    interests JSON,
