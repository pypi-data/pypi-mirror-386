"""
Test ReActAgent Convergence Detection - ADR-013 Implementation

Tests objective convergence detection using the `while(tool_call_exists)` pattern
from Claude Code's autonomous loop implementation.

This implements ADR-013's requirements for objective convergence detection:
1. Objective detection via tool_calls field (PREFERRED)
2. Subjective fallback via finish_action (backward compatibility)
3. >95% convergence accuracy
4. Zero breaking changes to existing agents

Test Coverage:
- Objective convergence with tool_calls present (not converged)
- Objective convergence with empty tool_calls (converged)
- Objective convergence with missing tool_calls (fallback to subjective)
- Backward compatibility with old signatures (no tool_calls field)
- MultiCycleStrategy objective convergence
- Max iterations enforcement
- Edge cases: None, [], [{}], malformed tool_calls
