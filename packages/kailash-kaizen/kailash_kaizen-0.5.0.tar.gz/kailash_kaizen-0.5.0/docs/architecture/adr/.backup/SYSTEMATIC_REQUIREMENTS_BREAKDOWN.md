kaizen = Kaizen(config={
    'signature_programming_enabled': True,
    'mcp_integration': {'auto_discover': True}
})

# Step 2: Signature creation (1 minute)
signature = kaizen.create_signature(
    "question: str -> answer: str, confidence: float",
    description="Q&A with confidence scoring"
)

# Step 3: Agent creation and binding (1 minute)
agent = kaizen.create_agent("qa_agent", signature=signature)

# Step 4: Direct execution (< 200ms)
result = agent.execute(question="What is machine learning?")
print(result.answer, result.confidence)  # Structured output

# Step 5: Workflow integration (2 minutes)
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
workflow.add_node_instance(agent.to_workflow_node("qa_step"))
runtime = LocalRuntime()
results, run_id = runtime.execute(workflow.build())

  - Clear error messages and debugging tools
- **Prevention**:
  - Formal grammar for signature syntax
  - Validation at parse time
  - Performance benchmarking

#### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination Deadlocks

- **Probability**: Medium (coordination is inherently complex)
- **Impact**: High (system becomes unreliable)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Timeout mechanisms for all coordination
  - Deadlock detection algorithms
  - Circuit breakers for failing agents
  - Formal verification of coordination patterns
- **Prevention**:
  - Proven coordination patterns only
  - Extensive testing with failure scenarios
  - Resource limit enforcement

#### 3. MCP Integration Performance

### Medium Risks (Monitor and Plan)

#### 1. Configuration System Complexity
- **Risk**: Enterprise configuration becomes too complex for developers
- **Probability**: Medium (feature creep is common)
- **Impact**: Medium (poor developer experience)
- **Mitigation**: Layered configuration with sensible defaults
- **Prevention**: User experience testing and feedback

#### 2. Framework Performance Degradation
- **Risk**: Enterprise features impact core performance
- **Probability**: Medium (monitoring/security add overhead)
- **Impact**: Medium (misses performance targets)
- **Mitigation**: Performance-first design, benchmarking
- **Prevention**: Continuous performance monitoring

#### 3. Integration Breaking Changes
- **Risk**: Core SDK changes break Kaizen integration
- **Probability**: Low (stable Core SDK patterns)
- **Impact**: High (requires significant rework)
