## ADR Dependencies & Reading Guides

### Autonomous Agent Capability Enhancement (011 through 017)

```
Foundational Layer:
├── 011: Control Protocol Architecture ← Bidirectional communication
└── 012: Permission System Design ← Runtime authorization

User-Defined Capabilities:
└── 013: Specialist System ← User-defined agents, skills, context

Execution Lifecycle:
├── 014: Hooks System ← Event-driven extensions
├── 015: State Persistence ← Checkpointing & resume
└── 016: Interrupt Mechanism ← User control mid-execution

Cross-Cutting Concerns:
└── 017: Observability & Performance ← Monitoring & metrics
```

### Reading Guide by Role

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Status**: Current status (Proposed/Accepted/Rejected/Superseded)
3. **Context**: The issue or decision that needs to be made
4. **Decision**: What was decided
5. **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
6. **Consequences**: Implications of this decision
7. **Implementation**: How the decision will be implemented

## Contributing to ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new ADR using the next available number
2. Follow the standard ADR format
3. Include thorough research and alternatives considered
4. Review with the development team
5. Update the index above

## Architecture Principles

The Kaizen Framework follows these architectural principles:

### 1. Enhancement Over Replacement
- Build ON existing Kailash infrastructure rather than replacing it
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with Core SDK
- Provide value through enhancement, not disruption

### 2. Developer Experience First
- Simplify complex operations through intelligent defaults
- Reduce configuration complexity through automation
- Provide clear, intuitive APIs

### 3. Enterprise-Ready
- Security, compliance, and governance built-in from day one
- Scalable architecture supporting enterprise workloads
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

### 4. Signature-Based Programming
- Use Python function signatures as the primary interface
- Automatic workflow generation and optimization
- Type safety and contract validation

### 5. Transparency and Governance
- Complete audit trails for all operations
- Real-time monitoring and introspection
- Distributed responsibility for monitoring
