    For a long time block device information originating form lsblk and udev
    was handled in a mutually exclusive way during root disk selection.
    The new ``mix and match`` approach allows IPA to collect and match
    ``disk serial`` and ``wwn`` root device hints against values coming
    from both ``lsblk`` and ``udev`` at the same time. The ``mix and match``
    approach is necessary to handle edge cases where the serial and/or wwn
    information is different in ``lsblk`` compared to ``udev``.
