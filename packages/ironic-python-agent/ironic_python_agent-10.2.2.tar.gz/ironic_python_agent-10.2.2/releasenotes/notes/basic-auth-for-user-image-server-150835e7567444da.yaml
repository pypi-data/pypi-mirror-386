    Introducing basic authentication and configurable authentication strategy
    support for image and image checksum download processes. This feature
    introduces 3 new variables that could be set (either via oslo.config or
    image_info) to select the authentication strategy an provide credentials
    for HTTP(S) basic authentication. The 3 variables are structured in way
    that 1 of them 'image_server_auth_strategy' (string) provides the ability
    to select between authentication strategies by specifying the name of
    the strategy. Currently the only supported authentication strategy is the
    'http-basic' which will make IPA use HTTP(S) basic authentication also
    known as the 'RFC 7617' standard. The other 2 variables
    'image_server_password' and 'image_server_user' provide username and
    password credentials for image download processes. The
    'image_server_password' and 'image_server_user' are not strategy specific
    and could be reused  for any username + password based authentication
    strategy, but for the moment these 2 variables are only used for the
    'http-basic' strategy. 'image_server_basic_auth' not just enables the
    feature but enforces checks on the values of the 2 related credentials.
    When the 'http-basic' strategy is enabled for image server download
    workflow the download logic will make sure to raise an exception in case
    any of the credentials are None or an empty string. Values coming from
    'image_info' are prioritized over values coming from the 'oslo.config'
    framework and the 2 different credential source can't be mixed. Passing 1
    or 2 out of the 3 from and source and the remaining values from an other
    source will result in a exception.
