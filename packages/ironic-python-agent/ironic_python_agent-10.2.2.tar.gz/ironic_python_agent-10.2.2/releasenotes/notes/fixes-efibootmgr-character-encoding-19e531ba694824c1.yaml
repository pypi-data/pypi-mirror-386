fixes:
  - |
    Fixes UEFI NVRAM record handling with efibootmgr so we can accept and
    handle UTF-16 encoded data which is to be expected in UEFI NVRAM as
    the records are UTF-16 encoded.
  - |
    Fixes handling of UEFI NVRAM records to allow for unexpected characters
    in the response, so it is non-fatal to Ironic.
