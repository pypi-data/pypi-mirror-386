    Fixes a potential security issue where a third party may be able to
    retrieve potentially sensitive data in command result output from
    the agent. If a request comes in with an ``agent_token`` to the
    command results endpoint, the agent will now require all future
    calls to leverage the token to retrieve results and validate
    that token's validity. This effectively eliminates the possibility
    of a malicious entity with access to the agent's API endpoint from
    capturing the command results from agent operations.
