features:
  - |
    The ``ironic-python-agent`` will now attempt to determine a checksum type
    by evaluating the length of the supplied checksum. This allows SHA512
    (SHA-2) and SHA256 (SHA-2) checksums to be identified and utilized without
    an explicit declaration of the checksum type utilizing the
    ``os_hash_algo`` value.
deprecations:
  - |
    Support for MD5 checksums have been deprecated and will be removed after
    the 2024 Release.
