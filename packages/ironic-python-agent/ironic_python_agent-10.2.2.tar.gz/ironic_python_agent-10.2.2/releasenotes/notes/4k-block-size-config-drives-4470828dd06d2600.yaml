    Fixes a failure case where a deployed instance may be unable to access
    the configuration drive post-deployment. This can occur when block
    devices only support 4KB IO interactions. When 4KB block IO sizes
    are in use, the ISO9660 filesystem driver in Linux cannot be used
    as it is modeled around a 2KB block. We now attempt to verify, and
    rebuild the configuration drive on a FAT filesystem when we cannot
    mount the supplied configuration drive. Operators can force the agent
    to write configuration drives using the FAT filesystem using the
    ``[DEFAULT]config_drive_rebuild`` option.
