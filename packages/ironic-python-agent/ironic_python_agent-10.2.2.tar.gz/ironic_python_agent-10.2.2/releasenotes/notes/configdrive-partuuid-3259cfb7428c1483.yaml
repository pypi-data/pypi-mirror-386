    Creating a configdrive partition on a devicemapper device (e.g. a multipath
    storage device) with MBR partitioning may fail with the following error::

      Command execution failed: Failed to create config drive on disk /dev/dm-0
      for node 168af30d-0fad-4d67-af99-b28b3238e977. Error: Unexpected error
      while running command.

    Use GPT partitioning instead.

    Fixes creating a configdrive partition on a devicemapper device (e.g.
    a multipath storage device) with GPT partitioning. The newly created
    partition is now detected by a pre-generated UUID rather than by comparing
    partition numbers.
