    Adds support for express cleaning mode where hardware-assisted, fast and
    secure data erasure is performed on NVMe devices that support it,
    while other devices fall back to erase_devices_metadata.
    The goal of this feature is to enable express node cleaning in
    environments with hybrid storage configuration (e.g. NVMe + HDD).
