    Fixes failures with handling of Multipath IO devices where Active/Passive
    storage arrays are in use. Previously, "standby" paths could result in
    IO errors causing cleaning to terminate. The agent now explicitly attempts
    to handle and account for multipaths based upon the MPIO data available.
    This requires the ``multipath`` and ``multipathd`` utility to be present
    in the ramdisk. These are supplied by the ``device-mapper-multipath`` or
    ``multipath-tools`` packages, and are not required for the agent's use.

    Fixes non-ideal behavior when performing cleaning where Active/Active
    MPIO devices would ultimately be cleaned once per IO path, instead of
    once per backend device.

    The agent will now attempt to collect any multipath path information
    and upload it to the agent ramdisk, if the tooling is present.
