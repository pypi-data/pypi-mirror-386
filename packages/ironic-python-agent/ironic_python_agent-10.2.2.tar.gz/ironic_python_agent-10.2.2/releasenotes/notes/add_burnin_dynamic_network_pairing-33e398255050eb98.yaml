    For network burn-in, nodes can now be paired dynamically via a
    distributed coordination backend (as an alternative to a static
    configuration). This allows burn-in to proceed on a "first come
    first served" basis with the nodes available, rather than a node
    being blocked since the static partner is currently delayed.

    In order to configure this dynamic pairing, the nodes will need
    at least ``agent_burnin_fio_network_pairing_backend_url`` in their
    ``driver_info`` (the URL for the coordination backend). In order to
    separate different hardware types, which may be using different
    networks and shall be burnt-in separately, the nodes can in
    addition define ``agent_burnin_fio_network_pairing_group_name`` to
    have pairing only happening between nodes in the same group. An
    additional parameter ``agent_burnin_fio_network_pairing_timeout`` allows to
    limit the time given to the nodes to wait for a partner.
