    Recent releases of redhat grub2 will always fail when installing to EFI
    paths, to encourage a transition to the signed shim bootloader.  Partition
    image deploys avoid calling grub2-install with the preserve-efi-assets
    functions. Deploying whole disk images doesn't require grub2-install. This
    leaves whole disk images installed onto softraid devices, which still calls
    grub2-install.  Running grub2-install is still attempted in this one
    remaining case, but any failures are now ignored.
