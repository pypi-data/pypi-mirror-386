    Fixes a failure case where downloads would not be retried when the
    checksum fails verification. the agent now includes the checksum
    activity as part of the file download operation, and will
    automatically retry downloads when the checksum fails in
    accordance with the existing download retry logic.
    This is largely in response to what appears to be intermittent
    transport failures at lower levels which we cannot otherwise
    detect.
