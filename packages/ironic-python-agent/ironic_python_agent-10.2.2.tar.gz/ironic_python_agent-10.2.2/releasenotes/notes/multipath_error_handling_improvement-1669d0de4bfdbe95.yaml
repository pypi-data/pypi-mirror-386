    Fixes the error handling of multipathd service startup/discovery process.
    IPA handles both scenario when the multipathd service is already started
    and the scenario when the service has not been started and in the second
    scenario IPA will try to start the service. IPA is not checking whether
    multipathd is running already and not, it will start the multipathd service
    even it is already running and expects 0 error code even if the service
    is already running. It has been noticed that with certain combinations of
    distros and multipathd versions the error code is not 0 when IPA tries
    to start multipathd when an instance of multipathd is already running.
    When the expected return code is not 0 that causes an exception and that
    will cause the multipath device discovery to terminate prematurely and
    if the selected root device is a multipath device then IPA won't be
    able to provision. This fix discards the exception that is caused by the
    non 0 error code returned by the multipathd startup process. In case there
    is a genuine issue with the multipath service, that would be caught when
    the actual multipath device listing command is executed (multipath -ll).
