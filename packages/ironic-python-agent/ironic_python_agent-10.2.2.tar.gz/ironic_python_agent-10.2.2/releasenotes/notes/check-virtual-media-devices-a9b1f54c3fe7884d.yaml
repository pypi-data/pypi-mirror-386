    Addresses a potential vector in which an system authenticated malicious
    actor could leveraged data left on disk in some limited cases to make the
    API of the ``ironic-python-agent`` attackable, or possibly break cleaning
    processes to prevent the machine from being able to be returned to the
    available pool. Please see `story 2008749 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2008749>`_
    for more information.
fixes:
  - |
    Adds validation of Virtual Media devices in order to prevent existing
    partitions on the system from being considered as potential sources of IPA
    configuration data.
  - |
    Adds check into the configuration load from virtual media, to ensure it
    only occurs when the machine booted from virtual media.
issues:
  - |
    Logic around virtual media device validation is now much more strict,
    and may not work in all cases. Should you discover a case, please provide
    the output from ``lsblk -P -O`` with a virtual media device attached to the
    Ironic development community via
    `Storyboard <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/947>`_.
  - |
    Internal logic to copy configuration data from virtual media now requires
    the ``boot_method=vmedia`` flag to be set on the kernel command line of
    the bootloader for the virtual media. Operators crafting custom boot
    ISOs, should ensure that the appropriate command line is being added in
    any custom build processes.
