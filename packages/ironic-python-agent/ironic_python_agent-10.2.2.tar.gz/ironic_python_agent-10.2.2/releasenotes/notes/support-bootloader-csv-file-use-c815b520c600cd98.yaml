    Adds the capability into the agent to read and act upon bootloader CSV
    files which serve as authoritative indicators of what bootloader to load
    instead of leaning towards utilizing the default.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes nodes failing after deployment completes due to issues in the Grub2
    EFI loader entry addition where a ``BOOT.CSV`` file provides the
    authoritative pointer to the bootloader to be used for booting the OS. The
    base issue with Grub2 is that it would update the UEFI bootloader NVRAM
    entries with whatever is present in a vendor specific ``BOOT.CSV`` or
    ``BOOTX64.CSV`` file. In some cases, a baremetal machine *can* crash when
    this occurs. More information can be found at
    `story 2008962 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2008962>`_.
issues:
  - |
    If multiple bootloader CSV files are present on the EFI filesystem, the
    first CSV file discovered will be utilized. The Ironic team considers
    multiple files to be a defect in the image being deployed. This may be
    changed in the future.
