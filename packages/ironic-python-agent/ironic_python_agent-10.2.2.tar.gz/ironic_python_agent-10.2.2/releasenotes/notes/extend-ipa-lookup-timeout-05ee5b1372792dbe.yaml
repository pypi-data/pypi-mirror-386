    The default timeout value for the agent to lookup itself in an Ironic
    deployment has been extended to 600 seconds from 300 seconds. This is
    to provide better stability for Ironic deployments under heavy load
    which may be unable to service new requests. This is particularly true
    when the backing database is SQLite for Ironic due to the limited write
    concurrency of the database.
