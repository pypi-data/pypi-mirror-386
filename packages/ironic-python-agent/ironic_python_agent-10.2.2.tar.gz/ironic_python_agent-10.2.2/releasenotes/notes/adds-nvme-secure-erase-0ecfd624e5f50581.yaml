features:
  - Adds support for NVMe-specific storage cleaning to IPA. Currently this is
    implemented by using nvme-cli format functionality. Crypto Erase is used
    if supported by the device, otherwise the code falls back to User Data
    Erase. The operators can control NVMe cleaning by using
    deploy.enable_nvme_erase config option which controls
    ``agent_enable_nvme_erase`` internal setting in driver_internal_info.
