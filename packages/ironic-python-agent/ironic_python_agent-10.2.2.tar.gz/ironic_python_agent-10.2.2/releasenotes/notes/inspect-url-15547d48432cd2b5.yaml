features:
  - |
    When the new Ironic built-in inspection is used,
    ``ipa-inspection-callback-url`` can now be automatically derived from
    ``ipa-api-url``. In this case, inspection will be enabled if the
    ``ipa-inspection-collectors`` option is set.
upgrade:
  - |
    If you currently set the ``ipa-inspection-collectors`` option without
    setting ``ipa-inspection-callback-url``, it will now cause inspection
    to run. Update your boot configuration to only supply the collectors
    when inspection is desired.
