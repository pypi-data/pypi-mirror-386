features:

    Adds a new ``service`` extension which facilitates command handling for
    Ironic to retrieve a list of service steps.
  - Adds a new base method to base HardwareManager, ``get_service_steps``
    which works the same as ``get_clean_steps`` and ``get_deploy_steps``.
    These methods can be extended by hardware managers to permit them to
    signal what steps are permitted.
  - Extends reasonable deploy/clean steps to also be service steps which
    are embedded in the Ironic agent. For example, CPU, Network, and Memory
    burnin steps are available as service steps, but not the disk burnin
    step as that would likely result in the existing disk contents being
    damaged.
