        Adds a branch identifier to the list of incoming branches for the node.

        Use this method to register a new incoming branch connection to the node, typically during network construction or when dynamically modifying the network topology. This ensures that the node maintains an accurate record of all branches entering it, which is essential for connectivity management and nodal analysis.

        Args:
            branch_id: The identifier of the branch to add as an incoming connection. Must be a hashable object representing the branch.

        Returns:

        Removes a branch identifier from the node's incoming or outgoing branch lists.

        This method is used internally to update the node's branch connections by removing the specified branch ID from either the `to_branch_ids` (outgoing) or `from_branch_ids` (incoming) lists. Use this method when you need to maintain accurate connectivity information after branch deletions or network reconfiguration. It is typically called by higher-level methods that manage node-branch relationships.

        Args:
            branch_id: The identifier of the branch to remove. Must match an entry in either `to_branch_ids` or `from_branch_ids`.

        This method updates the node's connectivity by removing both the specified branch ID and its reversed form (with the from/to nodes swapped) from the incoming and outgoing branch lists. Use this method when deleting a branch or reconfiguring the network to ensure all references to the branch are cleared, regardless of direction. It is typically called during network modification or cleanup operations.
