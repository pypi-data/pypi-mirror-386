"""Scripts used for development of the FlightGear flight simulator.

This package contains code used as scripts. This usually involves
command line parsing, associated help and other things we don't really
want to add to the API of the 'flightgear' Python package.

Modules and subpackages:

  currently_unused -- scripts we don't use but aren't quite ready to forget
  i18n             -- scripts used to help make FlightGear available in
                      various languages
