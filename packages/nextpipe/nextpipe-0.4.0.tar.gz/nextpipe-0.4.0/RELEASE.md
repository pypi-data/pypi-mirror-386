go to the corresponding repository for more information.

## Stable release

Open a PR against the `develop` branch with the following change:

* Update the version in the `nextpipe/__about__.py` file.

After the PR is merged, the `release.yml` workflow will be triggered and it
will automatically create a release and publish the package to PyPI.

## Pre-release
