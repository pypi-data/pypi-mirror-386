!!! warning "Not production-ready yet"
    prek is not production-ready yet. Some subcommands and languages are not implemented. See the current gaps for drop-in parity on the [TODO page](./todo.md).

    But it's already being adopted by [some projects](#who-is-using-prek) like Airflow, please give it a try - we'd love your feedback!
