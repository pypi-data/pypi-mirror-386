# TODO: Parity with pre-commit

This page tracks gaps that prevent `prek` from being a drop-in replacement for `pre-commit`.

## Subcommands not implemented

- `gc`

## Languages not supported yet

The original pre-commit supports hooks written in 10+ languages. Besides the commonly used ones like `python`, `node`, `golang`, `lua`, `system`, `script`, `pygrep`, `docker`, `docker_image`, and `fail` that are already supported, support for the following languages is still in the works:

- `conda`
- `coursier`
- `dart`
- `dotnet`
- `haskell`
- `julia`
- `perl`
- `r`
- `ruby`
- `rust`
- `swift`
