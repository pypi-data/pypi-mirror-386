# This workflow comments on a PR with the results of the cargo bloat check performed in the CI workflow.
# This is a workaround for the limitations imposed by GitHub Actions on workflows triggered by pull requests from forked repositories.

# The restrictions apply to the pull_request event triggered by a fork opening a pull request in the upstream repository.
# - Events from forks cannot access secrets, except for the default GITHUB_TOKEN.
# - The GITHUB_TOKEN has read-only access when an event is triggered by a forked repository.
#
# These restrictions mean that during a pull_request event triggered by a forked repository,
# actions have no write access to GitHub resources and will fail on any attempt.
