# Quick Look

Take a quick look at how to setup avalan in [Install](#install), which models and modalities you can use in [Models](#models), the tools available to agents in [Tools](#tools), the reasoning approaches in [Reasoning strategies](#reasoning-strategies), the memories you can configure in [Memories](#memories), how to build and deploy agents in [Agents](#agents), including serving over open protocols: [OpenAI API](#openai-completion-and-responses-api), [MCP](#mcp-server), and [A2A (Agent to Agent)](#a2a-server). For full CLI reference see the [CLI docs](docs/CLI.md).

## Models

Avalan provides text, audio and vision models that you can access from the CLI
or your own code. Run millions of [open models](#open-models) or call any
[vendor model](#vendor-models).

### Vendor models

Avalan supports all popular vendor models through
[engine URIs](docs/ai_uri.md). The example below uses OpenAI's GPT-4o:

```bash
echo "Who are you, and who is Leo Messi?" \
    | avalan model run "ai://$OPENAI_API_KEY@openai/gpt-4o" \
        --system "You are Aurora, a helpful assistant" \
        --max-new-tokens 100 \
        --temperature .1 \
        --top-p .9 \
        --top-k 20
```

### Open models

Open models run across engines such as transformers, vLLM and mlx-lm.
Search through millions of them with `avalan model search` using different
filters. The following command looks for up to three text-generation models that
run with the `mlx` backend, match the term `DeepSeek-R1`, and were published by
the MLX community:

```bash
avalan model search --name DeepSeek-R1 \
    --library mlx \
    --task text-generation \
    --author "mlx-community" \
    --limit 3
```

The command returns three matching models:

Test the model we just installed, specifying `mlx` as the backend:

> [!TIP]
> You can choose your preferred backend using the `--backend` option. For example,
> on Apple Silicon Macs, the `mlx` backend typically offers a 3x speedup
> compared to the default `transformers` backend. On devices with access to
> Nvidia GPUs, models that run on the backend `vllm` are also orders of
> magnitude faster.

```bash
echo 'What is (4 + 6) and then that result times 5, divided by 2?' | \
    avalan model run 'mlx-community/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B' \
        --temperature 0.6 \
        --max-new-tokens 1024 \
        --start-thinking \
        --backend mlx
```

The output shows the reasoning and the correct final answer:

### Audio

#### Audio classification

Determine the sentiment (neutral, happy, angry, sad) of a given audio file:

```bash
avalan model run "superb/hubert-base-superb-er" \
    --modality audio_classification \
    --path oprah.wav \
    --audio-sampling-rate 16000
```

And you'll get the likeliness of each sentiment:

```text
┏━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┓
┃ Label ┃ Score ┃
┡━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━┩
│ ang   │ 0.49  │
├───────┼───────┤
│ hap   │ 0.45  │
├───────┼───────┤
│ neu   │ 0.04  │
├───────┼───────┤
│ sad   │ 0.02  │
└───────┴───────┘
```

You can achieve the same result directly from Python:

```python
from avalan.model.audio.classification import AudioClassificationModel

with AudioClassificationModel("superb/hubert-base-superb-er") as model:
    labels = await model("oprah.wav", sampling_rate=16000)
    print(labels)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/audio_classification.py](docs/examples/audio_classification.py).

#### Speech recognition

Transcribe speech from an audio file:

```bash
avalan model run "facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h" \
    --modality audio_speech_recognition \
    --path oprah.wav \
    --audio-sampling-rate 16000
```

The output is the transcript of the provided audio:

```text
AND THEN I GREW UP AND HAD THE ESTEEMED HONOUR OF MEETING HER AND WASN'T
THAT A SURPRISE HERE WAS THIS PETITE ALMOST DELICATE LADY WHO WAS THE
PERSONIFICATION OF GRACE AND GOODNESS
```

The SDK lets you do the same programmatically:

```python
from avalan.model.audio.speech_recognition import SpeechRecognitionModel

with SpeechRecognitionModel("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h") as model:
    output = await model("oprah.wav", sampling_rate=16000)
    print(output)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/audio_speech_recognition.py](docs/examples/audio_speech_recognition.py).

#### Text to speech

Generate speech in Oprah's voice from a text prompt. The example uses an 18-second clip from her [eulogy for Rosa Parks](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/oprahwinfreyonrosaparks.htm) as a reference:

```bash
echo "[S1] Leo Messi is the greatest football player of all times." | \
    avalan model run "nari-labs/Dia-1.6B-0626" \
            --modality audio_text_to_speech \
            --path example.wav \
            --audio-reference-path docs/examples/oprah.wav \
            --audio-reference-text "[S1] And then I grew up and had the esteemed honor of meeting her. And wasn't that a surprise. Here was this petite, almost delicate lady who was the personification of grace and goodness."
```

In code you can generate speech in the same way:

```python
from avalan.model.audio.speech import TextToSpeechModel

with TextToSpeechModel("nari-labs/Dia-1.6B-0626") as model:
    await model(
        "[S1] Leo Messi is the greatest football player of all times.",
        "example.wav",
        reference_path="docs/examples/oprah.wav",
        reference_text=(
            "[S1] And then I grew up and had the esteemed honor of meeting her. "
            "And wasn't that a surprise. Here was this petite, almost delicate "
            "lady who was the personification of grace and goodness."
        ),
    )
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/audio_text_to_speech.py](docs/examples/audio_text_to_speech.py).

#### Audio generation

Create a short melody from a text prompt:

```bash
echo "A funky riff about Leo Messi." |
    avalan model run "facebook/musicgen-small" \
        --modality audio_generation \
        --max-new-tokens 1024 \
        --path melody.wav
```

Using the library instead of the CLI:

```python
from avalan.model.audio.generation import AudioGenerationModel

with AudioGenerationModel("facebook/musicgen-small") as model:
    await model("A funky riff about Leo Messi.", "melody.wav", max_new_tokens=1024)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/audio_generation.py](docs/examples/audio_generation.py).

### Text

#### Question answering

Answer a question based on context using a question answering model:

```bash
echo "What sport does Leo play?" \
    | avalan model run "deepset/roberta-base-squad2" \
        --modality "text_question_answering" \
        --text-context "Lionel Messi, known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time."
```

The answer comes as no surprise:

```text
football
```

Or run it from your own script:

```python
from avalan.model.nlp.question import QuestionAnsweringModel

with QuestionAnsweringModel("deepset/roberta-base-squad2") as model:
    answer = await model(
        "What sport does Leo play?",
        context="Lionel Messi, known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time."
    )
    print(answer)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/question_answering.py](docs/examples/question_answering.py).

#### Sequence classification

Classify the sentiment of short text:

```bash
echo "We love Leo Messi." \
    | avalan model run "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english" \
        --modality "text_sequence_classification"
```

The result is positive as expected:

```text
POSITIVE
```

The SDK version looks like this:

```python
from avalan.model.nlp.sequence import SequenceClassificationModel

with SequenceClassificationModel("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english") as model:
    output = await model("We love Leo Messi.")
    print(output)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/sequence_classification.py](docs/examples/sequence_classification.py).

#### Sequence to sequence

Summarize text using a sequence-to-sequence model:

```bash
echo "
    Andres Cuccittini, commonly known as Andy Cucci, is an Argentine
    professional footballer who plays as a forward for the Argentina
    national team. Regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all
    time, Cucci has achieved unparalleled success throughout his career.

    Born on July 25, 1988, in Ushuaia, Argentina, Cucci began playing
    football at a young age and joined the Boca Juniors youth
    academy.
" | avalan model run "facebook/bart-large-cnn" \
        --modality "text_sequence_to_sequence"
```

The summary:

```text
Andy Cucci is held by many as the greatest footballer of all times.
```

Calling from Python is just as easy:

```python
from avalan.model.nlp.sequence import SequenceToSequenceModel

with SequenceToSequenceModel("facebook/bart-large-cnn") as model:
    output = await model("""
    Andres Cuccittini, commonly known as Andy Cucci, is an Argentine
    professional footballer who plays as a forward for the Argentina
    national team. Regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all
    time, Cucci has achieved unparalleled success throughout his career.

    Born on July 25, 1988, in Ushuaia, Argentina, Cucci began playing
    football at a young age and joined the Boca Juniors youth
    academy.
    """)
    print(output)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/seq2seq_summarization.py](docs/examples/seq2seq_summarization.py).

#### Text generation

Run a local model and control sampling with `--temperature`, `--top-p`, and `--top-k`. The example instructs the assistant to act as "Aurora" and limits the output to 100 tokens:

```bash
echo "Who are you, and who is Leo Messi?" \
    | avalan model run "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct" \
        --system "You are Aurora, a helpful assistant" \
        --max-new-tokens 100 \
        --temperature .1 \
        --top-p .9 \
        --top-k 20
```

Here's the equivalent Python snippet:

```python
from avalan.entities import GenerationSettings
from avalan.model.nlp.text.generation import TextGenerationModel

with TextGenerationModel("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct") as model:
    async for token in await model(
        "Who are you, and who is Leo Messi?",
        system_prompt="You are Aurora, a helpful assistant",
        settings=GenerationSettings(
            max_new_tokens=100,
            temperature=0.1,
            top_p=0.9,
            top_k=20
        )
    ):
        print(token, end="", flush=True)
```

Vendor APIs use the same interface. Swap in a vendor [engine URI](docs/ai_uri.md) to call an external service. The example below uses OpenAI's GPT-4o with the same parameters:

```bash
echo "Who are you, and who is Leo Messi?" \
    | avalan model run "ai://$OPENAI_API_KEY@openai/gpt-4o" \
        --system "You are Aurora, a helpful assistant" \
        --max-new-tokens 100 \
        --temperature .1 \
        --top-p .9 \
        --top-k 20
```

Swap in the vendor URI in code too:

```python
from avalan.entities import GenerationSettings
from avalan.model.nlp.text.generation import TextGenerationModel
from os import getenv

api_key = getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
with TextGenerationModel(f"ai://{api_key}@openai/gpt-4o") as model:
    async for token in await model(
        "Who are you, and who is Leo Messi?",
        system_prompt="You are Aurora, a helpful assistant",
        settings=GenerationSettings(
            max_new_tokens=100,
            temperature=0.1,
            top_p=0.9,
            top_k=20
        )
    ):
        print(token, end="", flush=True)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/text_generation.py](docs/examples/text_generation.py).

Amazon Bedrock models use the same workflow. With your AWS credentials
configured (for example with `AWS_PROFILE` or environment variables),
you can target any Bedrock region via `--base-url`:

```bash
echo "Summarize the latest AWS re:Invent keynote in three bullet points." \
    | avalan model run "ai://bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v1:0" \
        --base-url "us-east-1" \
        --max-new-tokens 256 \
        --temperature .7
```

#### Token classification

Classify tokens with labels for Named Entity Recognition (NER) or
Part-of-Speech (POS):

```bash
echo "
    Lionel Messi, commonly known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine
    professional footballer widely regarded as one of the
    greatest football players of all time.
" | avalan model run "dslim/bert-base-NER" \
    --modality text_token_classification \
    --text-labeled-only
```

And you get the following labeled entities:

```text
┏━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Token    ┃ Label  ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━┩
│ [CLS]    │ B-PER  │
├──────────┼────────┤

Use the Python API if you prefer:

```python
from avalan.model.nlp.token import TokenClassificationModel

with TokenClassificationModel("dslim/bert-base-NER") as model:
    labels = await model(
        "Lionel Messi, commonly known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time.",
        labeled_only=True
    )
    print(labels)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/token_classification.py](docs/examples/token_classification.py).

#### Translation

Translate text between languages with a sequence-to-sequence model:

```bash
echo "
    Lionel Messi, commonly known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine
    professional footballer who plays as a forward for the Argentina
    national team. Regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all
    time, Messi has achieved unparalleled success throughout his career.
" | avalan model run "facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt" \
        --modality "text_translation" \
        --text-from-lang "en_US" \
        --text-to-lang "es_XX" \
        --text-num-beams 4 \
        --text-max-length 512
```

Here is the Spanish version:

```text
Lionel Messi, conocido como Leo Messi, es un futbolista argentino profesional
que representa a la Argentina en el equipo nacional. Considerado por muchos
como el mejor futbolista de todos los tiempos, Messi ha conseguido un éxito
sin precedentes durante su carrera.
```

The SDK call mirrors the CLI parameters:

```python
from avalan.entities import GenerationSettings
from avalan.model.nlp.sequence import TranslationModel

with TranslationModel("facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt") as model:
    output = await model(
        "Lionel Messi, commonly known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for the Argentina national team. Regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all time, Messi has achieved unparalleled success throughout his career.",
        source_language="en_US",
        destination_language="es_XX",
        settings=GenerationSettings(
            num_beams=4,
            max_length=512
        )
    )
    print(output)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/seq2seq_translation.py](docs/examples/seq2seq_translation.py).

### Vision

#### Encoder decoder

Answer questions to extract information from an image, without using OCR.

```bash
echo "<s_docvqa><s_question>
    What is the FACTURA Number?
</s_question><s_answer>" | \
    avalan model run "naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-docvqa" \
        --modality vision_encoder_decoder \
        --path docs/examples/factura-page-1.png
```

And you get the answer:

```
<s_docvqa>
<s_question>What is the FACTURA Number?</s_question>
<s_answer>0012-00187506</s_answer>
</s>
```

Here's how you'd call it in a script:

```python
from avalan.model.vision.decoder import VisionEncoderDecoderModel

with VisionEncoderDecoderModel("naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-docvqa") as model:
    answer = await model(
        "docs/examples/factura-page-1.png",
        prompt="<s_docvqa><s_question>What is the FACTURA Number?</s_question><s_answer>"
    )
    print(answer)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/vision_encoder_decoder.py](docs/examples/vision_encoder_decoder.py).

#### Image classification

Classify an image, such as determining whether it is a hot dog, or not a hot dog 🤓:

```bash
avalan model run "microsoft/resnet-50" \
    --modality vision_image_classification \
    --path docs/examples/cat.jpg
```

The model identifies the image:

```text
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Label            ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ tabby, tabby cat │
└──────────────────┘
```

Programmatic usage:

```python
from avalan.model.vision.image import ImageClassificationModel

with ImageClassificationModel("microsoft/resnet-50") as model:
    output = await model("docs/examples/cat.jpg")
    print(output)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/vision_image_classification.py](docs/examples/vision_image_classification.py).

#### Image to text

Generate a caption for an image:

```bash
avalan model run "salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base" \
    --modality vision_image_to_text \
    --path docs/examples/Example_Image_1.jpg
```

Example output:

```text
a sign for a gas station on the side of a building [SEP]
```

Python snippet:

```python
from avalan.model.vision.image import ImageToTextModel

with ImageToTextModel("salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base") as model:
    caption = await model("docs/examples/Example_Image_1.jpg")
    print(caption)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/vision_image_to_text.py](docs/examples/vision_image_to_text.py).

#### Image text to text

Provide an image and an instruction to an `image-text-to-text` model:

```bash
echo "Transcribe the text on this image, keeping format" | \
    avalan model run "ai://local/google/gemma-3-12b-it" \
        --modality vision_image_text_to_text \
        --path docs/examples/typewritten_partial_sheet.jpg \
        --vision-width 512 \
        --max-new-tokens 1024
```

The transcription (truncated for brevity):

```text
**INTRODUCCIÓN**

Guillermo de Ockham (según se utiliza la grafía latina o la inglesa) es tan célebre como conocido. Su doctrina
suele merecer las más diversas interpretaciones, y su biografía adolece tremendas oscuridades.
```

Invoke the model with the SDK like so:

```python
from avalan.entities import GenerationSettings
from avalan.model.vision.image import ImageTextToTextModel

with ImageTextToTextModel("google/gemma-3-12b-it") as model:
    output = await model(
        "docs/examples/typewritten_partial_sheet.jpg",
        "Transcribe the text on this image, keeping format",
        settings=GenerationSettings(max_new_tokens=1024),
        width=512
    )
    print(output)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/vision_ocr.py](docs/examples/vision_ocr.py).

#### Object detection

Detect objects in an image and list them with accuracy scores:

```bash
avalan model run "facebook/detr-resnet-50" \
    --modality vision_object_detection \
    --path docs/examples/kitchen.jpg \
    --vision-threshold 0.3
```

Results are sorted by accuracy and include bounding boxes:

```text
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Label        ┃ Score ┃ Box                              ┃

```

This is how you'd do it in code:

```python
from avalan.model.vision.segmentation import SemanticSegmentationModel

with SemanticSegmentationModel("nvidia/segformer-b0-finetuned-ade-512-512") as model:
    labels = await model("docs/examples/kitchen.jpg")
    print(labels)
```
For a runnable script, see [docs/examples/vision_semantic_segmentation.py](docs/examples/vision_semantic_segmentation.py).

#### Text to animation

Create an animation from a prompt using a base model for styling:

```bash
echo 'A tabby cat slowly walking' | \
    avalan model run "ByteDance/AnimateDiff-Lightning" \
        --modality vision_text_to_animation \
        --base-model "stablediffusionapi/mistoonanime-v30" \
        --checkpoint "animatediff_lightning_4step_diffusers.safetensors" \
        --weight "fp16" \
        --path example_cat_walking.gif \
        --vision-beta-schedule "linear" \
        --vision-guidance-scale 1.0 \
        --vision-steps 4 \
        --vision-timestep-spacing "trailing"
```

And here's the generated anime inspired animation of a walking cat:

![An anime cat slowly walking](https://avalan.ai/images/github/vision_text_to_animation_generated.webp)

## Tools

Avalan makes it simple to launch a chat-based agent that can call external tools while streaming tokens. Avalan ships native helpers for `math.calculator`, `code.run`, `browser.open`, `database.*`, memory, and MCP integrations so agents can reason with numbers, execute code, browse the web, and interact with SQL databases from a single prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep a human in the loop by adding `--tools-confirm` when you run an agent. Avalan will ask you to confirm each tool call before it executes, so you retain control over side effects.

### Math toolset (`math.*`)

Use the math toolset whenever your agent needs deterministic arithmetic or algebraic answers. The calculator tool delegates evaluation to SymPy, making it ideal for verifying multi-step computations instead of relying on approximate language model reasoning.

**Available tools**

- `math.calculator(expression: str) -> str`: Evaluate an arithmetic expression (including parentheses and operator precedence) and return the numeric result as a string.

#### Example: `math.calculator`

The example below uses a local 8B LLM, enables recent memory, and loads a calculator tool. The agent begins with a math question and stays open for follow-ups:

```bash
echo "What is (4 + 6) and then that result times 5, divided by 2?" \
  | avalan agent run \
      --engine-uri "NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B" \
      --tool "math.calculator" \
      --memory-recent \
      --run-max-new-tokens 8192 \
      --name "Tool" \
      --role "You are a helpful assistant named Tool, that can resolve user requests using tools." \
      --stats \
      --display-events \
      --display-tools \
      --conversation
```

Notice the GPU utilization at the bottom:

![Example use of an ephemeral tool agent with memory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e15cdd4c-f037-4151-88b9-d0acbb22b0ba)

You can give your GPU some breathing type by running the same on a vendor model, like Anthropic:

```bash
echo "What is (4 + 6) and then that result times 5, divided by 2?" \
  | avalan agent run \
      --engine-uri "ai://$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY@anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest" \
      --tool "math.calculator" \
      --memory-recent \
      --run-max-new-tokens 8192 \
      --name "Tool" \
      --role "You are a helpful assistant named Tool, that can resolve user requests using tools." \
      --stats \
      --display-events \
      --display-tools \
      --conversation
```

### Code toolset (`code.*`)

Reach for the code toolset when the agent should write, execute, or refactor source code in a controlled environment. Execution happens inside a RestrictedPython sandbox and pattern searches are backed by the `ast-grep` CLI, enabling agents to safely prototype logic, manipulate files, or build refactoring plans.

**Available tools**

- `code.run(code: str, *args, **kwargs) -> str`: Execute a snippet that defines a `run` function and return the function result as text, which is useful for testing generated utilities or validating calculations programmatically.
- `code.search.ast.grep(pattern: str, lang: str, rewrite: str | None = None, paths: list[str] | None = None) -> str`: Search or rewrite codebases using structural patterns, helping agents answer "where is this API used?" or propose targeted edits.

#### Example: `code.run`

Below is an agent that leverages the `code.run` tool to execute Python code generated by the model and display the result:

```bash
echo "Create a python function to uppercase a string, split it spaces, and then return the words joined by a dash, and execute the function with the string 'Leo Messi is the greatest footballer of all times'" \
  | avalan agent run \
      --engine-uri 'ai://local/openai/gpt-oss-20b' \
      --backend mlx \
      --tool-format harmony \
      --tool "code.run" \
      --memory-recent \
      --run-max-new-tokens 1024 \
      --name "Tool" \
      --role "You are a helpful assistant named Tool, that can resolve user requests using tools." \
      --stats \
      --display-events \
      --display-tools
```

### Database toolset (`database.*`)

Connect the database toolset when an agent must inspect schemas, understand query plans, or run SQL against an external data source. Tools share a pooled SQLAlchemy engine, enforce optional read-only policies, and normalize identifier casing so that agents can explore data safely.

When your agent needs live access to data, configure the database toolset. In the example below we point the agent to a Supabase database, and after prompting for sales data we'll see the agent executing `database.tables` and `database.inspect` to understand the schema, before running SQL with `database.run`:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Database sessions are read-only by default (`read_only = true`) and only permit `SELECT` statements unless you relax the policy. Adjust these safeguards with the database tool settings—for example, set `allowed_commands = ["select", "insert"]` (or pass `--tool-database-allowed-commands select,insert` on the CLI) and toggle `read_only` in your agent specification when you need to allow writes.

```bash
echo "Get me revenue per product, sorting by highest selling" | \
    avalan agent run \
      --engine-uri "ai://local/openai/gpt-oss-20b" \
      --backend mlx \
      --tool-format harmony \
      --tool "database" \
      --tool-database-dsn "postgresql+asyncpg://postgres.project_id:password@aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres" \
      --system "Reasoning: high" \
      --developer "You are a helpful assistant that can resolve user data requests using database tools." \
      --stats \
      --display-tools
```

**Available tools**

- `database.count(table_name: str) -> int`: Return the number of rows in a table—handy for quick health checks or progress reporting.
- `database.inspect(table_names: list[str], schema: str | None = None) -> list[Table]`: Describe table columns and foreign keys so the agent can reason about relationships before writing SQL.
- `database.keys(table_name: str, schema: str | None = None) -> list[TableKey]`: Enumerate primary and unique key definitions so the agent understands table-level uniqueness guarantees.
- `database.relationships(table_name: str, schema: str | None = None) -> list[TableRelationship]`: Surface incoming and outgoing foreign key links for a table so the agent can understand join paths and cardinality constraints.
- `database.plan(sql: str) -> QueryPlan`: Request an `EXPLAIN` plan to validate or optimize a generated query.
- `database.run(sql: str) -> list[dict[str, Any]]`: Execute read or write statements (subject to policy) and return result rows for downstream reasoning.
- `database.sample(table_name: str, columns: list[str] | None = None, conditions: str | None = None, order: dict[str, str] | None = None, count: int | None = None) -> list[dict[str, Any]]`: Fetch up to `count` rows (default 10) from a table so agents can preview data, optionally narrowing by columns, SQL conditions, or ordering before crafting more complex queries.
- `database.locks() -> list[DatabaseLock]`: Inspect PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB lock metadata—including blocking session IDs, lock targets, and whether the lock is granted—to debug contention before running or terminating queries.
- `database.tables() -> dict[str | None, list[str]]`: List tables grouped by schema—useful for schema discovery in unknown databases.
- `database.tasks(running_for: int | None = None) -> list[DatabaseTask]`: Surface long-running queries on PostgreSQL or MySQL so humans can monitor or intervene.
- `database.kill(task_id: str) -> bool`: Cancel a runaway query when safeguards permit it.
- `database.size(table_name: str) -> TableSize`: Summarize how much space a table occupies, including data and index bytes where the backend provides them, so agents can gauge storage usage before recommending optimizations.

### Browser toolset (`browser.*`)

Use the browser toolset to capture live information from the web or intranet sites. The Playwright-backed browser renders pages, converts them to Markdown, and can optionally search the captured content to keep only the most relevant snippets for the agent.

**Available tools**

- `browser.open(url: str) -> str`: Navigate to a URL and return the rendered page in Markdown, optionally narrowed to search results derived from the user prompt.

Tools give agents real-time knowledge. This example uses an 8B model and a browser tool to find avalan's latest release:

```bash
echo "What's avalan's latest release on https://github.com/avalan-ai/avalan/releases" | \
    avalan agent run \
      --engine-uri "NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B" \
      --tool "browser.open" \
      --memory-recent \
      --run-max-new-tokens 1024 \
      --name "Tool" \
      --role "You are a helpful assistant named Tool, that can resolve user requests using tools." \
      --stats \
      --display-events \
      --display-tools
```

When using the browser tool to extract knowledge, be mindful of your context window. With OpenAI's gpt-oss-20b, the model processes 7261 input tokens before producing a final response. When browser context search is enabled (using `--tool-browser-search` and `--tool-browser-search-context`), that number decreases to 1443 input tokens, and the response time improves proportionally:

```bash
echo "What's avalan's latest release on https://github.com/avalan-ai/avalan/releases" | \
    avalan agent run \
      --engine-uri 'ai://local/openai/gpt-oss-20b' \
      --backend mlx \
      --tool-format harmony \
      --tool "browser.open" \
      --tool-browser-search \
      --tool-browser-search-context 10 \
      --run-max-new-tokens 1024 \
      --name "Tool" \
      --role "You are a helpful assistant named Tool, that can resolve user requests using tools." \
      --stats \
      --display-tools
```

### Memory toolset (`memory.*`)

Add the memory toolset when agents should consult past conversations or long-lived knowledge bases. The tools can retrieve prior user messages, search permanent vector memories, list stored entries, or enumerate available stores so the agent knows where to look.

**Available tools**

- `memory.message.read(search: str) -> str`: Retrieve user-specific context from prior sessions, returning `NOT_FOUND` when no match exists.
- `memory.read(namespace: str, search: str) -> list[PermanentMemoryPartition]`: Fetch chunks of long-term knowledge inside a namespace for grounding responses.
- `memory.list(namespace: str) -> list[Memory]`: Enumerate stored memories in a namespace so the agent can decide which entries to reuse.
- `memory.stores() -> list[PermanentMemoryStore]`: List permanent memory stores available to the agent for broader exploration.

### YouTube toolset (`youtube.*`)

Use the YouTube toolset to ground responses in video transcripts—great for summarizing talks or extracting key quotes without manual downloads. Proxy support keeps the integration flexible for restricted networks.

**Available tools**

- `youtube.transcript(video_id: str, languages: Iterable[str] | None = None) -> list[str]`: Fetch ordered transcript snippets for a given video, optionally prioritizing specific languages.

### MCP toolset (`mcp.*`)

Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to orchestrate specialized remote tools. The MCP toolset lets avalan agents proxy any MCP-compatible capability via a single tool call.

**Available tools**

- `mcp.call(uri: str, name: str, arguments: dict[str, object] | None) -> list[object]`: Connect to an MCP server and invoke one of its tools with structured arguments, returning the raw MCP responses.

### Search tool (`search_engine.search`)

For quick demos or testing, Avalan also provides a stubbed search tool that illustrates how to wire internet lookups into an agent. Replace its implementation with a real provider to give agents access to live search APIs.

## Reasoning strategies

Avalan supports several reasoning approaches for guiding agents through complex problems.

### Reasoning models

Reasoning models that emit thinking tags are natively supported. Here's OpenAI's gpt-oss 20B solving a simple calculation:

```bash
echo 'What is (4 + 6) and then that result times 5, divided by 2?' | \
    avalan model run 'ai://local/openai/gpt-oss-20b' \
        --max-new-tokens 1024 \
        --backend mlx
```

The response includes the model reasoning, and its final answer:

![OpenAI's reasoning model responding to a math question](https://avalan.ai/images/github/text_generation_reasoning_openai.webp)

Some of them, like `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B`, assume the model starts thinking without a thinking tag, so we'll use `--start-thinking`:

```bash
echo 'What is (4 + 6) and then that result times 5, divided by 2?' | \
    avalan model run 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B' \
        --temperature 0.6 \
        --max-new-tokens 1024 \
        --start-thinking \
        --backend mlx
```

![DeepSeek's reasoning model responding to a math question](https://avalan.ai/images/github/text_generation_reasoning_deepseek-2.webp)

Nvidia's Nemotron reasoning model solves the same problem easily and doesn't require the `--start-thinking` flag, since it automatically produces think tags. It does so more verbosely, though (**962** output tokens versus DeepSeek's **186** output tokens or OpenAI's more concise **140** tokens), since it detects ambiguity in the `and then that result` part of the prompt and ends up revisiting the essential principles of mathematics, to the point of realizing it's overthinking 🤓

> [!TIP]
> Endless reasoning rants can be stopped by setting `--reasoning-max-new-tokens` to the maximum number of reasoning tokens allowed, and adding `--reasoning-stop-on-max-new-tokens` to finish generation when that limit is reached.

```bash
echo 'What is (4 + 6) and then that result times 5, divided by 2?' | \
    avalan model run "nvidia/OpenReasoning-Nemotron-14B" \
        --weight "bf16" \
        --max-new-tokens 30000 \
        --backend mlx
```

![Nvidia's reasoning model responding to a math question](https://avalan.ai/images/github/text_generation_reasoning_nvidia-2.webp)

When using reasoning models, be mindful of your total token limit. Some reasoning models include limit recommendations on their model cards, like the following model from Z.ai:

```bash
echo 'What is (4 + 6) and then that result times 5, divided by 2?' | \
    avalan model run 'zai-org/GLM-Z1-32B-0414' \
        --temperature 0.6 \
        --top-p .95 \
        --top-k 40 \
        --max-new-tokens 30000 \
        --start-thinking \
        --backend mlx
```

### ReACT

ReACT interleaves reasoning with tool use so an agent can think through steps and take actions in turn.

You can direct an agent to read specific locations for knowledge:

```bash
echo "Tell me what avalan does based on the web page https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avalan-ai/avalan/refs/heads/main/README.md" | \
    avalan agent run \
      --engine-uri "NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B" \
      --tool "browser.open" \
      --memory-recent \
      --run-max-new-tokens 1024 \
      --name "Tool" \
      --role "You are a helpful assistant named Tool, that can resolve user requests using tools." \
      --stats \
      --display-events \
      --display-tools
```

and you'll get the model's interpretation of what Avalan does based on its README.md file on github:

![ReACT browsing tool usage for real-time information](https://avalan.ai/images/github/text_generation_tools_browser.webp)

### Chain-of-Thought

Chain-of-Thought builds sequential reasoning traces to reach an answer for tasks that require intermediate logic.

### Tree-of-Thought

Tree-of-Thought explores multiple branches of reasoning in parallel to select the best path for difficult decisions.

### Plan-and-Reflect

Plan-and-Reflect has the agent outline a plan, act, and then review the results, promoting methodical problem solving.

### Self-Consistency

Self-Consistency samples several reasoning paths and aggregates them to produce more reliable answers.

### Scratchpad-Toolformer

Scratchpad-Toolformer combines an internal scratchpad with learned tool usage to manipulate intermediate results.

### Cascaded Prompting

Cascaded Prompting chains prompts so each step refines the next, ideal for multi-stage instructions.

### Critic-Guided Direction-Following Experts

Critic-Guided Direction-Following Experts use a critic model to guide expert models when strict quality is required.

### Product-of-Experts

Product-of-Experts merges the outputs of several experts to generate answers that benefit from multiple viewpoints.

## Memories

Avalan offers a unified memory API with native implementations for PostgreSQL
(using pgvector), Elasticsearch, AWS Opensearch, and AWS S3 Vectors.

Start a chat session and tell the agent your name. The `--memory-permanent-message` option specifies where messages are stored, `--id` uniquely identifies the agent, and `--participant` sets the user ID:

```bash
echo "Hi Tool, my name is Leo. Nice to meet you." \
  | avalan agent run \
      --engine-uri "NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B" \
      --memory-recent \
      --memory-permanent-message "postgresql://root:password@localhost/avalan" \
      --id "f4fd12f4-25ea-4c81-9514-d31fb4c48128" \
      --participant "c67d6ec7-b6ea-40db-bf1a-6de6f9e0bb58" \
      --run-max-new-tokens 1024 \
      --name "Tool" \
      --role "You are a helpful assistant named Tool, that can resolve user requests using tools." \
      --stats
```

Enable persistent memory and the `memory.message.read` tool so the agent can recall earlier messages. It should discover that your name is `Leo` from the previous conversation:

```bash
echo "Hi Tool, based on our previous conversations, what's my name?" \
  | avalan agent run \
      --engine-uri "NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B" \
      --tool "memory.message.read" \
      --memory-recent \
      --memory-permanent-message "postgresql://root:password@localhost/avalan" \
      --id "f4fd12f4-25ea-4c81-9514-d31fb4c48128" \
      --participant "c67d6ec7-b6ea-40db-bf1a-6de6f9e0bb58" \
      --run-max-new-tokens 1024 \
      --name "Tool" \
      --role "You are a helpful assistant named Tool, that can resolve user requests using tools." \
      --stats
```

Agents can use knowledge stores to solve problems. Index the rules of the "Truco" card game directly from a website. The `--dsn` parameter sets the store location and `--namespace` chooses the knowledge namespace:

```bash
avalan memory document index \
    --participant "c67d6ec7-b6ea-40db-bf1a-6de6f9e0bb58" \
    --dsn "postgresql://root:password@localhost/avalan" \
    --namespace "games.cards.truco" \
    "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" \
    "https://trucogame.com/pages/reglamento-de-truco-argentino"
```

Create an agent, give it access to the indexed memory store and the `memory` tool, and your question:

> [!TIP]
> If you rather create a permanent agent, see the equivalent
> [agent_memory.toml](docs/examples/agent_memory.toml) agent definition.

```bash
echo "What does the memory stored in namespace games.cards.truco say about retrucar?" | \
  avalan agent run \
    --engine-uri "ai://local/openai/gpt-oss-20b" \
    --backend mlx \
    --tool-format harmony \
    --tool memory \
    --system "Reasoning: high" \
    --developer "You are an expert assistant that can use the memory tool to answer questions about card games." \
    --memory-recent \
    --memory-engine-model-id "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" \
    --memory-engine-max-tokens 500 \
    --memory-engine-overlap 125 \
    --memory-engine-window 250 \
    --memory-permanent "games.cards.truco@postgresql://root:password@localhost/avalan" \
    --run-max-new-tokens 8192 \
    --run-temperature 0.1 \
    --run-top-p 0.9 \
    --run-top-k 40 \
    --participant "c67d6ec7-b6ea-40db-bf1a-6de6f9e0bb58"
```

And you should get your answer:

```text
<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to fetch memory stored in namespace games.cards.truco. Use memory.read.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.memory.read <|constrain|>json<|message|>{"namespace":"games.cards.truco","search":"retrucar"}<|call|><|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have the memory content. We need to answer: "What does the memory stored in namespace games.cards.truco say about retrucar?" Summarize relevant parts. The memory says: In Truco, after a Truco call, the next player can retrucar. Retrucar is a counter-raise. Only the team that has wanted the last bet can retrucar. The team that has retrucado cannot raise again; only the opposing team can. Retrucar is only possible after a "Quiero" response. Also, the team that has wanted the Truco can retrucar at any time. The team that has called Truco cannot raise until the other team raises. So answer accordingly.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>In the Truco rules stored in the **games.cards.truco** namespace, “retrucar” is described as the **counter‑raise** that a team can make after the opponent has called *Truco* and the other team has answered *“Quiero”*.

Key points from the memory:

| What the memory says | Explanation |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Retrucar is only possible after a “Quiero”** | The team that has answered *“Quiero”* to the original *Truco* can now raise the stakes again. |
| **Only the team that has wanted the last bet can retrucar** | The team that just said *“Quiero”* (the “last bet”) is the one that may retrucar. |
| **The team that has retrucado cannot raise again** | Once a team has retrucado, it cannot raise the bet again; only the opposing team can do so. This is sometimes referred to as “tener el quiero.” |
| **The team that called the original Truco cannot raise until the other team raises** | After the first *Truco* is called, the calling team must wait for the other team to raise (retrucar) before they can raise again. |
| **Retrucar is a valid move only when the opponent has said “Quiero”** | If the opponent says anything other than *“Quiero”* (e.g., “sí”, “vemos”), the retrucar is not considered valid. |

So, in short, the memory explains that **retrucar is the act of raising the bet again after the opponent has accepted the original *Truco* call, and it can only be done by the team that has just said “Quiero.”**%
```

PDF files are natively supported by memories. Let's index an arxiv paper (in its PDF format) from September 2025, considerably after the training date of the model we'll later use to query it:

```bash
avalan memory document index \
    --participant "c67d6ec7-b6ea-40db-bf1a-6de6f9e0bb58" \
    --dsn "postgresql://root:password@localhost/avalan" \
    --namespace "papers.arxiv" \
    "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" \
    "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17325"
```

Now let's ask the memory agent about that paper (notice the description added when defining the memory store with `--memory-permanent`):

```bash
echo "What papers do you have in memory?" | \
  avalan agent run \
    --engine-uri "ai://local/openai/gpt-oss-20b" \
    --backend mlx \
    --tool-format harmony \
    --tool memory \
    --system "Reasoning: high" \
    --developer "You are an expert assistant that can use the memory tool to answer questions about card games." \
    --memory-recent \
    --memory-engine-model-id "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" \
    --memory-engine-max-tokens 500 \
    --memory-engine-overlap 125 \
    --memory-engine-window 250 \
    --memory-permanent "papers.arxiv@postgresql://root:password@localhost/avalan,Papers from ARXIV" \
    --run-max-new-tokens 8192 \
    --run-temperature 0.1 \
    --run-top-p 0.9 \
    --run-top-k 40 \
    --participant "c67d6ec7-b6ea-40db-bf1a-6de6f9e0bb58"
```

And the stored paper is found:

```text

| ID | URL | Title | Description |
|----|-----|-------|-------------|
| 1 | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17325 | **Generalizable End-to-End Tool-Use RL with Synthetic CodeGym** | Tool‑augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external tools to solve diverse tasks and interface with the real world. Current training practices largely rely on supervised fine‑tuning (SFT) over static trajectories or reinforcement learning (RL) on narrow tasks, and generalize poorly beyond development settings, leading to brittleness with new tools and unseen workflows. Because code execution reflects many structures of real‑world workflows, coding problems provide a natural basis for building agent training environments. Motivated by this, we introduce CodeGym, a scalable framework that synthesizes diverse, verifiable, and controllable multi‑turn tool‑use environments for agent RL, enabling LLM agents to explore and master various workflows actively. CodeGym rewrites static coding problems into interactive environments by extracting atomic functions or logic into callable tools, yielding verifiable tasks that span various tool‑execution workflows. Models of varying sizes and chain‑of‑thought configurations, trained in CodeGym, exhibit consistent out‑of‑distribution generalizability; for example, Qwen2.5‑32B‑Instruct achieves an absolute accuracy gain of 8.7 points on the OOD benchmark τ‑Bench. These results highlight CodeGym as a step toward scalable general‑purpose RL environments that align with real‑world agent workflows. |

## Agents

You can easily create AI agents from configuration files. Let's create one to handle gettext translations.
Create a file named [agent_gettext_translator.toml](https://github.com/avalan-ai/avalan/blob/main/docs/examples.agent_gettext_translator.toml)
with the following contents:

```toml
[agent]
role = """
You are an expert translator that specializes in translating gettext
translation files.
"""
task = """
Your task is to translate the given gettext template file,
from the original {{source_language}} to {{destination_language}}.
"""
instructions = """
The text to translate is marked with `msgid`, and it's quoted.
Your translation should be defined in `msgstr`.
"""
rules = [
    """
    Ensure you keep the gettext format intact, only altering
    the `msgstr` section.
    """,
    """
    Respond only with the translated file.
    """
]

[template]
source_language = "English"
destination_language = "Spanish"

[engine]
uri = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"

[run]
use_cache = true
max_new_tokens = 1024
skip_special_tokens = true
```

You can now run your agent. Let's give it a gettext translation template file,
have our agent translate it for us, and show a visual difference of what the
agent changed:

```bash
icdiff locale/avalan.pot <(
    cat locale/avalan.pot |
        avalan agent run docs/examples/agent_gettext_translator.toml --quiet
)
```

![diff showing what the AI translator agent modified](https://avalan.ai/images/github/agent_gettext_translator.webp)

There are more agent, NLP, multimodal, audio, and vision examples in the
[docs/examples](docs/examples/README.md)
folder.

### Serving agents

Avalan agents can be exposed over three open protocols: OpenAI-compatible REST endpoints (supporting completions and streaming responses), Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Agent to Agent (A2A) as first-class tools. They are provided by the same `avalan agent serve` process so you can pick what fits your stack today and evolve without lock-in.

> [!TIP]
> Add one or more `--protocol` flags (for example `--protocol openai`) when running `avalan agent serve` to restrict the interfaces you expose without changing your configuration.

All three interfaces support real-time reasoning plus token and tool streaming, letting you observe thoughts, tokens, tool calls, and intermediate results as they happen.

#### OpenAI completion and responses API

Serve your agents on an OpenAI API–compatible endpoint:

```bash
avalan agent serve docs/examples/agent_tool.toml -vvv
```

> [!NOTE]
> Avalan's OpenAI-compatible endpoint supports both the legacy completions API and the newer [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/migrate-to-responses).

Agents listen on port 9001 by default.

> [!TIP]
> Use `--port` to serve the agent on a different port.

Or build an agent from inline settings and expose its OpenAI API endpoints:

```bash
avalan agent serve \
    --engine-uri "NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B" \
    --tool "math.calculator" \
    --memory-recent \
    --run-max-new-tokens 1024 \
    --name "Tool" \
    --role "You are a helpful assistant named Tool, that can resolve user requests using tools." \
    -vvv
```

You can call your tool streaming agent's OpenAI-compatible endpoint just like
the real API; simply change `--base-url`:

```bash
echo "What is (4 + 6) and then that result times 5, divided by 2?" | \
    avalan model run "ai://openai" --base-url "http://localhost:9001/v1"
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `--protocol openai:responses,completion` to enable both OpenAI Responses and Completions endpoints, or narrow the surface by specifying just `responses` or `completion` after the colon.

#### MCP server

Avalan also embeds an HTTP MCP server alongside the OpenAI-compatible
endpoints whenever you run `avalan agent serve`. It is mounted at `/mcp` by
default and can be changed with `--mcp-prefix`.

> [!TIP]
> Use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) and
> enter your MCP endpoint URL, the value you configured with `--mcp-prefix`
> when running `avalan agent serve` (default: `http://localhost:9001/mcp`).
> Click `Connect`, then `List Tools`, run the tool that appears (it will match
> your `--mcp-name` and `--mcp-description`), and observe the streaming
> notifications and the final response, which includes reasoning and any tool
> calls with their arguments and results.

You can customize the MCP tool identity with `--mcp-name` (defaults to `run`) and `--mcp-description` when running `avalan agent serve`.

> [!TIP]
> Use `--protocol mcp` (optionally along with other `--protocol` flags) to expose only the MCP interface when serving your agent.

#### A2A server

Avalan also embeds an A2A-compatible server alongside the OpenAI-compatible
endpoints whenever you run `avalan agent serve`. It is mounted at `/a2a` by
default and can be configured with `--a2a-prefix`. The A2A surface supports
streaming, including incremental tool calling and intermediate outputs.

> [!TIP]
> Use the [a2a inspector](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-inspector) and
> enter your agent card URL, the value you configured with `--a2a-prefix`
> when running `avalan agent serve` (default: `http://localhost:9001/a2a/agent`).
> You can customize the agent identity with `--a2a-name` and
> `--a2a-description`, then observe the streaming notifications, tool calls,
> and final responses.

You can customize the A2A agent identity with `--a2a-name` (defaults to `run`)
and `--a2a-description` when running `avalan agent serve`.

> [!TIP]
> Use `--protocol a2a` (optionally combined with other `--protocol` flags) to expose just the A2A interface for your served agent.

#### Embedding in existing FastAPI apps

If you already run a FastAPI service, reuse the same OpenAI, MCP, or A2A endpoints without spawning a standalone server. Call `avalan.server.register_agent_endpoints` during startup to attach the routers and lifecycle management to your application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from logging import getLogger

from avalan.model.hubs.huggingface import HuggingfaceHub
from avalan.server import register_agent_endpoints


app = FastAPI()
logger = getLogger("my-app")
hub = HuggingfaceHub()

register_agent_endpoints(
    app,
    hub=hub,
    logger=logger,
    specs_path="docs/examples/agent_tool.toml",
    settings=None,
    tool_settings=None,
    mcp_prefix="/mcp",
    openai_prefix="/v1",
    mcp_name="run",
    protocols={"openai": {"responses"}},
)
```

The helper composes with any existing FastAPI lifespan logic, setting up the orchestrator loader only once and wiring the same streaming endpoints that `avalan agent serve` exposes.

#### Proxy agents

The command `agent proxy` serves as a quick way to serve an agent that:

* Wraps a given `--engine-uri`.
* Enables recent message memory.
* Enables persistent message memory (defaulting to pgsql with pgvector.)

For example, to proxy OpenAI's gpt-4o, do:

```bash
avalan agent proxy \
    --engine-uri "ai://$OPENAI_API_KEY@openai/gpt-4o" \
    --run-max-new-tokens 1024 \
    -v
```

Like `agent serve`, the proxy listens on port 9001 by default.

And you can connect to it from another terminal using `--base-url`:

```bash
echo "What is (4 + 6) and then that result times 5, divided by 2?" | \
    avalan model run "ai://openai" --base-url "http://localhost:9001/v1"
```

# Install

On macOS, install avalan with Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap avalan-ai/avalan
```

In other environments, use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install
avalan with the `all` extra:

```bash
poetry install avalan --extras all
```
