  # Long Text  
  {long_text}
  
  # Task
  From the provided long text (e.g., scraped web content or other documents), **extract and organize** all segments that are directly relevant to the following query:
  
  # Current Datetime  
  {datetime}
  
  # Query  
  {query}
  
  # Requirements:  
  - **Extract precisely**: Preserve original wording and factual details — do not paraphrase or summarize unless absolutely necessary for coherence.  
  - **Clean and organize**: Remove any content that is irrelevant to the query. Retain only segments that directly address or substantively relate to the query.  
  - **Time-filtered**: Keep only content dated within the most recent few years (typically 3–5 years from {datetime}), unless older content is explicitly critical for context or continuity. Clearly indicate if older content is retained and why.  
  - Maintain strict accuracy and neutrality — avoid assumptions, interpretations, or editorializing.  
  - Format output in Markdown, using only headings up to level three (###).  
  - Use the same language as the query (e.g., if query is in English, output in English; if in Chinese, output in Chinese).  
  - Clearly separate and label each relevant excerpt if multiple non-contiguous segments are extracted.  
  - If no relevant content exists (after filtering for recency and relevance), explicitly state: No relevant content found matching the query.
