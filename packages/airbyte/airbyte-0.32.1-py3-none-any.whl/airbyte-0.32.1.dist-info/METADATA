## Connector Installation

### Declarative Source Installation

For Declarative Sources defined in YAML, the installation process will is to simply download the yaml file from the `connectors.airbyte.com` public URLs, and to run them directly as YAML.

Declarative sources have the fastest download times, due to the simplicity and each of install.

In some cases, you may get better stability by using `docker_image=True` in `get_source()`/`get_destination()`, due to the fact that all dependencies are locked within the docker image.

### Python Installation

Generally, when Python-based installation is possible, it will be performed automatically given a Python-based connector name.

In some cases, you may get better stability by using `docker_image=True` in `get_source()`/`get_destination()`, due to the fact that all dependencies are locked within the docker image.

#### Installing Connectors with `uv`

By default, beginning with version `0.29.0`, PyAirbyte defaults to [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) instead of `pip` for Python connector installation. Compared with `pip`, `uv` is much faster. It also provides the unique ability of specifying different versions of Python than PyAirbyte is using, and even Python versions which are not already pre-installed on the local workstation.

If you prefer to fall back to the prior `pip`-based installation methods, set the env var `AIRBYTE_NO_UV=true`.

#### Installing Connectors With a Custom Python Version

In both `get_source()` and `get_destination()`, you can provide a `use_python` input arg that is equal to the desired version of Python that you with to use for the given connector. This can be helpful if an older connector doesn't support the version of Python that you are using for PyAirbyte itself.

For example, assuming PyAirbyte is running on Python 3.12, you can install a connector using Python 3.10.13 with the following code snippet:

```py
import airbyte as ab

source = ab.get_source(
    "source-faker",
    use_python="3.10.17",
)
```

### Installing Connectors with Docker

For any connector (`get_source()`/`get_destination()`), you can specify the `docker_image` argument to `True` to prefer Docker over other default installation methods or `docker_image=MY_IMAGE` to leverage a specific docker image tag for the execution.

## Frequently asked Questions

**1. Does PyAirbyte replace Airbyte?**
No. PyAirbyte is a Python library that allows you to use Airbyte connectors in Python, but it does not have orchestration
or scheduling capabilities, nor does is provide logging, alerting, or other features for managing pipelines in
production. Airbyte is a full-fledged data integration platform that provides connectors, orchestration, and scheduling capabilities.

**2. What is the PyAirbyte cache? Is it a destination?**
Yes and no. You can think of it as a built-in destination implementation, but we avoid the word "destination" in our docs to prevent confusion with our certified destinations list [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/).

**3. Does PyAirbyte work with data orchestration frameworks like Airflow, Dagster, and Snowpark,**
Yes, it should. Please give it a try and report any problems you see. Also, drop us a note if works for you!

**4. Can I use PyAirbyte to develop or test when developing Airbyte sources?**
Yes, you can. PyAirbyte makes it easy to test connectors in Python, and you can use it to develop new local connectors
as well as existing already-published ones.

**5. Can I develop traditional ETL pipelines with PyAirbyte?**
Yes. Just pick the cache type matching the destination - like SnowflakeCache for landing data in Snowflake.

**6. Can PyAirbyte import a connector from a local directory that has python project files, or does it have to be pip install**
Yes, PyAirbyte can use any local install that has a CLI - and will automatically find connectors by name if they are on PATH.
