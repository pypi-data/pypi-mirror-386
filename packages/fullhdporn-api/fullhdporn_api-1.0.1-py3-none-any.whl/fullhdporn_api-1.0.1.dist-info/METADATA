# Quickstart

### Have a look at the [Documentation](https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/API_Docs/blob/master/Porn_APIs/fullhdporn.md) for more details
- Install the library with `pip install fullhdporn_api`


```python
from fullhdporn_api import Client
# Initialize a Client object
client = Client()

# Fetch a video
video_object = client.get_video("<insert_url_here>")

# Information from Video objects
print(video_object.title)
# Download the video
video_object.download(quality="best", path="your_output_path + filename")
# Download speeds can be very slow. This is not my fault, it's the CDN
# SEE DOCUMENTATION FOR MORE
```

# Support (Donations)
I am developing all my projects entirely for free. I do that because I have fun and I don't want
to charge 30€ like other people do.

However, if you find my work useful, please consider donating something. A tiny amount such as 1€
means a lot to me.

# Notice
This API is almost fully written by ChatGPT. I don't see a reason to
write the stuff myself when ChatGPT can do the same as I in less
than 20 minutes. It just makes my life easier, but I of course tested
everything, so it's not some AI garbage. This thing actually works :)
