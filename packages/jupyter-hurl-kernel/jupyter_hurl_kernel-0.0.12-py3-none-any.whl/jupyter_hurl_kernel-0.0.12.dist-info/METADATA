# Jupyter Hurl Kernel

A Jupyter kernel for executing [Hurl](https://hurl.dev) commands directly in Jupyter notebooks.

## What is Hurl?

Hurl is a command line tool that runs HTTP requests defined in a simple plain text format. It's designed for testing HTTP endpoints, APIs, and web services. Learn more at [hurl.dev](https://hurl.dev).

## Features

- Execute Hurl commands directly in Jupyter notebook cells
- Get HTTP responses displayed in the notebook
- Supports all Hurl syntax and features
- Easy to install and use

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.13+** - This project requires Python 3.13 or higher
2. **Hurl** - Install Hurl from [hurl.dev/docs/installation.html](https://hurl.dev/docs/installation.html)

### Installing Hurl

**On macOS:**
```bash
brew install hurl
```

**On Linux:**
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
curl -LO https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl/releases/latest/download/hurl_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i hurl_amd64.deb

# Or build from source
cargo install hurl
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
# Using Scoop
scoop install hurl

# Or using Chocolatey
choco install hurl
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
hurl --version
```

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install jupyter-hurl-kernel
install-hurl-kernel
```

For installation in a virtual environment or server:
```bash
pip install jupyter-hurl-kernel
install-hurl-kernel --sys-prefix
```

**That's it!** The package includes syntax highlighting for both:
- **JupyterLab 4.x** (automatic via bundled extension)
- **JupyterLab 3.x and Classic Jupyter Notebook** (automatic via CodeMirror 5 mode)

### From Source

1. Clone or download this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/micedre/jupyter-hurl-kernel.git
cd jupyter-hurl-kernel
```

2. Install the package using uv:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

3. Install the Jupyter kernel:
```bash
install-hurl-kernel
```

For installation in a virtual environment:
```bash
install-hurl-kernel --sys-prefix
```

4. Verify the kernel is installed:
```bash
jupyter kernelspec list
```

You should see `hurl` in the list of available kernels.

## Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

2. Create a new notebook and select "Hurl" as the kernel

3. Write Hurl commands in notebook cells:

**Example 1: Simple GET request**
```hurl
GET https://www.insee.fr
```

**Example 2: GET with headers**
```hurl
GET https://api.github.com/users/octocat
User-Agent: MyApp/1.0
Accept: application/json
```

**Example 3: POST request**
```hurl
POST https://httpbin.org/post
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}
```

**Example 4: Testing with assertions**
```hurl
GET https://httpbin.org/json
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
jsonpath "$.slideshow.title" == "Sample Slide Show"
```

**Example 5: Include response headers (using `%%include`)**
```hurl
%%include
GET https://api.github.com/users/octocat
```

**Example 6: Verbose output with all details (using `%%verbose`)**
```hurl
%%verbose
GET https://api.github.com/users/octocat
```

4. Run the cell (Shift+Enter) to execute the Hurl command

The kernel will display:
- HTTP response output
- Any errors or validation failures

### Magic Lines

You can control the output level using magic lines at the start of cells. These magic lines correspond to Hurl's command-line flags:

- **No magic line** (default) - Shows only the response body
- `%%include` - Shows response headers and body (equivalent to `hurl --include`)
- `%%verbose` - Shows all information including request details, response headers, body, timing, etc. (equivalent to `hurl --verbose`)

**Examples:**

Normal output (body only):
```hurl
GET https://www.insee.fr
```

Include mode (headers + body):
```hurl
%%include
GET https://www.insee.fr
```

Verbose mode (complete details):
```hurl
%%verbose
GET https://www.insee.fr
```

## Features

### Autocompletion

The kernel provides intelligent autocompletion for Hurl syntax. Press `Tab` to trigger autocompletion:

- **HTTP Methods**: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, etc.
- **Common Headers**: `Content-Type:`, `Authorization:`, `Accept:`, `User-Agent:`, etc.
- **Hurl Sections**: `[Asserts]`, `[Captures]`, `[QueryStringParams]`, `[FormParams]`, etc.
- **Magic Lines**: `%%include`, `%%verbose`
- **Content Types**: When typing `Content-Type:`, get suggestions for common MIME types

The autocompletion is context-aware and will suggest relevant completions based on where your cursor is positioned.

### Documentation Tooltips

Hover over or press `Shift+Tab` on keywords to see documentation:

- **HTTP Methods**: See descriptions of what each HTTP method does
- **Hurl Sections**: Get examples and explanations for each section type
- **Magic Lines**: Learn what each magic line does

Example: Place your cursor on `GET` and press `Shift+Tab` to see:
```
HTTP GET Method

GET method requests a representation of the specified resource.
Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
```

### Syntax Highlighting

The kernel includes built-in syntax highlighting for all Jupyter environments:

- **JupyterLab 4.x**: Uses bundled CodeMirror 6 extension (automatically enabled)
- **JupyterLab 3.x and Classic Jupyter Notebook**: Uses CodeMirror 5 mode (automatically enabled)

Syntax highlighting provides:

- **HTTP Methods** (GET, POST, etc.) - highlighted as keywords
- **URLs** - highlighted as strings
- **Headers** - highlighted as attributes
- **Section headers** ([Asserts], [Captures], etc.) - highlighted as headers
- **Magic lines** (%%include, %%verbose) - highlighted as meta
- **Assertions** (status, jsonpath, etc.) - highlighted as builtins
- **Operators** (==, !=, >, <, etc.) - highlighted as operators
- **Numbers and strings** - appropriately colored
- **Comments** (#) - highlighted as comments
- **JSONPath and XPath expressions** - highlighted as variables

The syntax highlighting is automatically installed when you run `install-hurl-kernel`. After installation, you may need to refresh your browser for the highlighting to take effect.

## How It Works

The kernel works by:
1. Taking the Hurl code from the notebook cell
2. Writing it to a temporary `.hurl` file
3. Executing `hurl --color <file>`
4. Capturing and displaying the output in the notebook
5. Cleaning up the temporary file

## Troubleshooting

### Code completion or syntax highlighting not working

If autocompletion or syntax highlighting isn't working on your Jupyter server, see the detailed [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide.

**Quick fixes:**
1. Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Restart Jupyter server completely
3. Reinstall: `pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall jupyter-hurl-kernel`
4. Verify extension is loaded: `jupyter labextension list` (should show jupyterlab-hurl-extension)
5. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors

### "hurl is not installed" error

Make sure Hurl is installed and available in your PATH:
```bash
which hurl
hurl --version
```

### Kernel not appearing in Jupyter

Try reinstalling the kernel:
```bash
install-hurl-kernel --user
jupyter kernelspec list
```

### Command timeout

By default, commands timeout after 30 seconds. For long-running requests, this can be adjusted in the kernel code.

## Development

To modify the kernel:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/micedre/jupyter-hurl-kernel.git
   cd jupyter-hurl-kernel
   ```

2. Install in development mode:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   install-hurl-kernel --sys-prefix
   ```

3. Make your changes to the kernel code in `src/jupyter_hurl_kernel/`

4. Restart your Jupyter notebook kernel to test changes

### Running Tests

```bash
# Build the package to verify
uv build

# Check the distribution
uv tool run twine check dist/*
```

## Uninstallation

To remove the kernel:
```bash
jupyter kernelspec uninstall hurl
```

To uninstall the package:
```bash
uv pip uninstall jupyter-hurl-kernel
```
