Python API and CLI
====================================

A Python API for user-friendly interaction with a Polytope server is available at `polytope-client <https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/polytope-client>`_. It can be installed from source or from PyPI with ``python3 -m pip install polytope-client``.

Once the Python module is installed, it can either be used directly in Python scripts and sessions (i.e. ``from polytope import api``), or be used via the command-line tool that is installed together with the module (i.e. ``which polytope``).

More details on installation and usage can be found in the ``readme.md`` file in the source of `polytope-client <https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/polytope-client>`_, as well as in the documentation of the Python module (e.g. ``help(api)``) and in the documentation of the command-line tool (e.g. ``polytope --help``).
