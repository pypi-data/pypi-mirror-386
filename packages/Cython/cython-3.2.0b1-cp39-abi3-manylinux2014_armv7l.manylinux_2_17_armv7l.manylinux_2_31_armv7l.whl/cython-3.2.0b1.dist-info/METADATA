The Cython language makes writing C extensions for the Python language as
easy as Python itself.  Cython is a source code translator based on Pyrex_,
but supports more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.

The Cython language is a superset of the Python language (almost all Python
code is also valid Cython code), but Cython additionally supports optional
static typing to natively call C functions, operate with C++ classes and
declare fast C types on variables and class attributes.  This allows the
compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code.

This makes Cython the ideal language for writing glue code for external
C/C++ libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of
Python code.

The newest Cython release can always be downloaded from https://cython.org/.
Unpack the tarball or zip file, enter the directory, and then run::

    pip install .

Note that for one-time builds, e.g. for CI/testing, on platforms that are not
covered by one of the wheel packages provided on PyPI *and* the pure Python wheel
that we provide is not used, it is substantially faster than a full source build
to install an uncompiled (slower) version of Cython with::

    NO_CYTHON_COMPILE=true pip install .

3.2.0b1 (2025-10-22)
====================

Features added
--------------

* Builtin exception types are now inferred.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6908)

* The list of known, inferred and optimised Python builtins was updated.
  `range` is now considered a type. `ascii`, `bin`, `format`, `hex`, `oct` were added as functions.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6931)

* The f-string syntax was extended according to PEP-701.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5452)

* t-strings are implemented according to PEP-750.  The implementation backports the template classes
  but prefers existing backports if installed separately.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6811)

* Unknown return type annotations with `->` are no longer rejected but produce warnings.
  This allows better integration with Python type hints that are not always usable for Cython.
  ``-> None``  is also allowed now.
  Patch by jpe.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6946)

* The runtime Python dispatch for fused functions is substantially faster.
  (Github issues https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1385, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6996)

* Freelists (via cdef class decorator and for internally used types such as ``async``)
  are now also used in the Limited API and with extension type specs enabled.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7151)

* Module imports now quickly check for an already imported module to speed up reimports.
  Patch by Lysandros Nikolaou.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7035)

* Type checks on PEP-604 union types (`int | None`) are optimised into separate checks.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6935)

* Assignments to the PEP-604 union type `float | None` allow any suitable Python number as input
  and convert it to a Python `float` automatically.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5750)

* Item type inference was improved for looping over literals.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6912)

* Looping over literal sequences and strings now uses efficient C array looping if possible.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6926)

* Releasing the GIL from an unknown lock state is more efficient.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6847)

* ``cython.critical_section(PyMutex)`` now works, as with Python objects.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6847)

* ``bool(c_int/float/ptr)`` avoid passing through Python objects.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7015)

* Variables assigned inside of ``prange`` loops can now be initialised outside of the loop.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7178)

* Unused exceptions in ``except`` clauses are detected in some more cases to avoid their normalisation.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7021)

* Mixed operations on C integers with Python ints use less code and are more streamlined for Py3.12+.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7244)

* Some object constants are now marked as ``immortal`` to speed up their reference counting
  in recent CPython versions.  This can be configured with the ``CYTHON_IMMORTAL_CONSTANTS`` C macro.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7118)

* Further improvements were made to reduce the size of the resulting extension modules.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6983, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7199, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7220, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7238)

* Several improvements were made in freethreaded Python code.
  (Github issues https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6936, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6939, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6949, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6984,

  (Github issues https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6959, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6991)

* Several improvements were made for the GraalPython support.
  Patch by Michael Šimáček.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7074)

* Some GIL-safe C-API wrappers were added to the libc/libcpp declarations.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6829, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6993)

* String and number constants use less storage space in the module.
  (Github issues https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6971, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6978, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6986)

* The managed dict/weakref support in CPython 3.12+ is used for internal types
  to benefit from future CPython optimisations here.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6891)

* Using ``NaN`` as exception return value is supported.
  (Github issues https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6900, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6903)

* Declarations for C++ condition variables were added.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6836)

* The annotated source HTML page shows alternating +/− markers to open/close lines.
  Patch by Kamil Monicz.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7099)

* ``cython --embed`` gained a new option ``--embed-modules=…`` to list further extension modules
  that will be statically linked into the generated extension module, to get them initialised
  on application start.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2849)

* The ``setup.py`` script of Cython now allows passing the desired Limited API version
  like ``--cython-limited-api=3.11``.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7228)

* Unicode 16.0.0 is used to parse identifiers.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6836)

Bugs fixed
----------

* Special float exception values could generate invalid C code.
  (Github issues https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6900, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6903)

* References to the Python ``bool`` type could generate invalid C code.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6902)

* Unicode characters formatted from C integers with ``f"{value:c}"`` could result in
  invalid Python string objects since Cython 3.1.0.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7240)

* Vectorcalls could use needless temp assignments for ``self``.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6909)

* Iterating over temporary memoryviews could crash Cython.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7005)

* Type casts on constants as part of numeric expressions could crash Cython.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6779)

* Long code bodies in ``with`` statements could crash Cython.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7122)

* Indexing ``bytes`` failed to optimise in some cases.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6997)

* Optimised C integer formatting in f-strings failed to apply to typedef types.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7170)

* In auto-pickling, trying to unpickle an object that has no ``__dict__`` from object pickle data
  that includes instance dict state is now an error.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7222)

* The type objects of heap types were not always correctly decrefed on deallocation.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7145)

* Pure mode type aliases like ``p_int`` or ``ulong`` leaked into some C type contexts,
  risking to conflict with user declarations.
  (Github issues https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6922, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6339)

* Boolean (emptyness) tests on builtin containers could fail to handle (unlikely) errors.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7090)

* The return type of ``bytes.join()`` was sometimes inferred as plain ``object``.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6987)

* Type inference could fail to understand ``prange()`` arguments.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6974)

* ``embedsignatures`` failed if ``lambda`` was used in function default arguments.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6880)

* An internal C function was not marked as ``static`` and leaked a linker symbol.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6957)

* ``PyType_FromModuleAndSpec`` was incorrectly used in Limited API code before Py3.10.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7181)

* Conversion code for memoryview dtypes from and to Python objects generated C warnings about
  incorrect ``const`` / non-``const``  casting code.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7219)

* ``cythonize`` (program and function) now uses ``concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor``
  instead of ``multiprocessing.Pool`` to fix a hang on build failures in parallel builds.
  A possible work-around is to disable parallel builds.
  Patch by Sviatoslav Sydorenko.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7183)

* Cython's tools and frontend scripts now use ``python3``  instead of just ``python``
  in their shebang line.
  Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7053)

* The ``setup.py`` script in the ``Demos/`` subdirectory failed to build.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7228)

* Includes all fixes as of Cython 3.1.5.

3.1.5 (2025-10-20):

* Conversion from C++ strings longer than ``PY_SSIZE_T_MAX`` did not validate the length.

* Some non-Limited API code was incorrectly used in generated header files.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7157)

* Optimised unpacking of Python integers in expressions uses a slightly safer scheme.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7134)

* Empty return statements were not always reported when tracing.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7022)

* Value conversion errors when tracing C return statements no longer fail the trace
  but fall back to reporting ``None`` returns instead.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6503)

Other changes
-------------

* Usages of `Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_FINALIZE` were removed.  The constant remains available as cimport from
  ``cpython.object`` for legacy reasons.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6423)
