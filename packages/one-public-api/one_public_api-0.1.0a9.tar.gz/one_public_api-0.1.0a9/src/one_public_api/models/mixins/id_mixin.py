    Mixin class for providing an auto-generated unique identifier to records.

    This class is designed as a mixin to be inherited by other classes. Its purpose
    is to automatically assign a universally unique identifier (UUID) as the
    primary key for the associated record. This ensures that each record has a
    unique and immutable identifier.
