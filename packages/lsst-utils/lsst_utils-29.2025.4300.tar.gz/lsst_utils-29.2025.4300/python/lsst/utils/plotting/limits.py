    Given one or more data series with potential outliers, calculated the
    values to pass for ymin, ymax so that extreme outliers don't ruin the
    plot. If you are plotting several series on a single axis, pass them
    all in and the overall plotting range will be given.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_series : `iterable` or `iterable` of `iterable`
        One or more data series which will be going on the same axis, and
        therefore want to have their common plotting limits calculated.
    percentile : `float`, optional
        The percentile used to clip the outliers from the data.
    constant_extra : `float` or `None`, optional
        The amount that's added on each side of the range so that data does not
        quite touch the axes. If the default ``None`` is left then 5% of the
        data range is added for cosmetics, but if zero is set this will
        overrides this behaviour and zero you will get.
    symmetric_around_zero : `bool`, optional
        Whether to make the limits symmetric around zero.

    Returns
    -------
    ymin : `float`
        The value to set the ylim minimum to.
    ymax : `float`
        The value to set the ylim maximum to.
