def inheritDoc(klass: type) -> Callable:
    """Extend existing documentation for a method that exists in another
    class and extend it with any additional documentation defined.

    This decorator takes a class from which to draw documentation from as an
    argument. This is so that any class may be used as a source of
    documentation and not just the immediate parent of a class. This is useful
    when there may be a long inheritance chain, or in the case of mixins.

    Parameters
    ----------
    klass : object
        The class to inherit documentation from.

    Returns
    -------
    decorator : callable
        Intermediate decorator used in the documentation process.

    Notes
    -----
    This method naively appends the doc string from the decorated method to the
    doc string of the equivalent method from the given class. No attempt
    is made to ensure that duplicated sections are merged together or
    overwritten.

    This decorator is not necessary to ensure that a parent doc string appears
    in a subclass. Tools like ``pydoc`` and Sphinx handle that automatically.
    This can, though, be used to ensure that a specific docstring from a
    parent class appears if there is ambiguity from multiple inheritance.
