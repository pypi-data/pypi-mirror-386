    A class decorated as `immutable` may only set each of its attributes once;
    any attempts to set an already-set attribute will raise `AttributeError`.

    Notes
    -----
    Subclasses of classes marked with ``@immutable`` are also immutable.

    Because this behavior interferes with the default implementation for the
    ``pickle`` modules, `immutable` provides implementations of
    ``__getstate__`` and ``__setstate__`` that override this behavior.
    Immutable classes can then implement pickle via ``__reduce__`` or
    ``__getnewargs__``.

    Following the example of Python's built-in immutable types, such as `str`
    and `tuple`, the `immutable` decorator provides a ``__copy__``
    implementation that just returns ``self``, because there is no reason to
    actually copy an object if none of its shared owners can modify it.

    Similarly, objects that are recursively (i.e. are themselves immutable and
    have only recursively immutable attributes) should also reimplement
    ``__deepcopy__`` to return ``self``.  This is not done by the decorator, as
    it has no way of checking for recursive immutability.

    -----
    This is intended primarily as a stopgap for Python 3.8's more sophisticated
    ``functools.cached_property``, but it is also explicitly compatible with
    the `immutable` decorator, which may not be true of ``cached_property``.

    `cached_getter` guarantees that the cached value will be stored in
    an attribute named ``_cached_{name-of-decorated-function}``.  Classes that
    use `cached_getter` are responsible for guaranteeing that this name is not
    otherwise used, and is included if ``__slots__`` is defined.
