‚ùå JSON PARSING ERROR DETECTED

Error: {{ error_message }}

{% if error_context %}
Context around error:
```
...{{ error_context }}...
```

{% endif %}
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Your previous attempt had a JSON formatting error, NOT a content error.

DO NOT re-investigate or make up new issues!
DO NOT call any tools (read_file, read_diff, etc.) - you already did the investigation.
DO NOT invent file paths for COMMENTS - use ONLY the paths from files changed in this PR:

{% for path in file_paths %}
  ‚úì {{ path }}
{% endfor %}

üí° These paths are for the "file_path" field in your changes array.

YOUR TASK:
1. Take the SAME findings you already discovered in your investigation
2. Remove any duplicates (check against previous comments using the "one fix" test)
3. Format them as valid JSON with proper escaping
4. Use ONLY the file paths marked with ‚úì above
5. Use the EXACT field names specified (NOT alternatives)

‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
- ‚ùå DON'T use "file" - use "file_path"
- ‚ùå DON'T use "type" or "issue_type" - use "category"
- ‚ùå DON'T use "message" - use "description"
- ‚ùå DON'T use "proposed_fix" - use "suggestion"
- ‚ùå DON'T omit ANY of the 11 required fields
- ‚ùå DON'T make title longer than 80 characters (keep it SHORT!)

‚úÖ REQUIRED FIELDS (ALL 11 in EVERY change object):
file_path, start_line, end_line, severity, category, title, description, suggestion, code_snippet, suggested_code, rationale

Requirements for the JSON:
- All strings must be properly escaped (especially quotes, newlines, backslashes)
- All brackets and braces must be balanced
- No trailing commas in arrays or objects
- Valid JSON structure throughout
- Use ONLY file paths from the ‚úì list above

Generate the corrected JSON now (ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations):
