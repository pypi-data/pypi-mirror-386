    Use this tool to inform the user about:
    - Progress updates (e.g., "Completed reading all files, preparing review")
    - Important findings or observations
    - Next steps you're about to take
    - Anything else the user might want to know during the review process
    
    This is especially useful before time-consuming operations like building
    the final review summary.
