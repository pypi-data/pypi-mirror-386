# Control Plane OpenAPI MCP Server

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server provides seamless integration with the Facets Control Plane API through its OpenAPI specification. It enables AI assistants to understand, explore, and interact with the complete Facets Control Plane API, making infrastructure management and API integration more accessible through natural language interactions.

## Key Features

* **Real-time OpenAPI Integration**  
  Automatically fetches and processes the latest OpenAPI specification from Facets Control Plane, ensuring you always have access to current API documentation.

* **Built-in Script Generation Guidance**  
  Includes an MCP prompt that provides step-by-step guidance for creating production-ready scripts that interact with Control Plane APIs, with best practices for authentication, testing, and error handling.

* **Intelligent Operation Filtering**  
  Automatically excludes deprecated operations (17 filtered out of 566 total) to provide clean, relevant results and improved search performance.

* **Advanced Fuzzy Search**  
  Search through 549 active operations and 500+ schemas using natural language queries with intelligent matching across summaries, descriptions, tags, and operation IDs.

* **Comprehensive API Coverage**  
  Access complete operation details including parameters, request bodies, response schemas, and authentication requirements for all Facets Control Plane endpoints.

* **Smart Caching System**  
  Intelligent TTL-based caching minimizes API calls while ensuring fresh data, with configurable cache duration for optimal performance.

* **Detailed Schema Exploration**  
  Explore complex data structures with property listings, type information, and relationship mappings for all API schemas.

## Prerequisites

The MCP Server requires [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management and execution.

#### Install `uv` with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install uv
```

For other installation methods, see the [official uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## Integration with Claude

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "control-plane-openapi": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/your/cloned/control-plane-openapi-mcp", "control-plane-openapi-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CONTROL_PLANE_URL": "https://<customername>.console.facets.cloud",
        "FACETS_USERNAME": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
        "FACETS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>",
        "FACETS_PROFILE": "default",
        "CACHE_TTL": "3600"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

⚠️ Replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with your actual Facets credentials.

### Environment Variables

- `CONTROL_PLANE_URL`: Base URL of the Facets Control Plane (default: demo instance)
- `FACETS_USERNAME`: Your Facets username for API authentication
- `FACETS_TOKEN`: Your Facets access token for API authentication
- `FACETS_PROFILE`: Facets profile to use from credentials file (default: "default")
- `CACHE_TTL`: Cache time-to-live in seconds (default: 3600)

### Authentication

The server supports two authentication methods:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set `FACETS_USERNAME` and `FACETS_TOKEN`
2. **Credentials File**: Configure `~/.facets/credentials` with profile-based credentials

For credential setup, refer to the [Facets Authentication Guide](https://readme.facets.cloud/reference/authentication-setup).

## Usage Highlights

- Uses `search_api_operations` and `search_api_schemas` to find relevant endpoints using natural language
- Uses specific load operations to get detailed parameter and response information
- Uses `call_control_plane_api` to make actual API calls and get real data from your Facets environment
- Leverages the fuzzy search to find operations even with partial or approximate terms

## API Coverage

The server provides access to the complete Facets Control Plane API including:

- **Stack Management**: Create, update, delete, and manage infrastructure stacks
- **Cluster Operations**: Deploy, monitor, and manage Kubernetes clusters  
- **Artifact Management**: Handle CI/CD artifacts and routing rules
- **User & Access Control**: Manage users, groups, roles, and permissions
- **Resource Management**: Handle cloud resources and configurations
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Access deployment logs, metrics, and monitoring data
- **Authentication**: OAuth integrations, tokens, and account management

## Example Prompts

When using with Claude, try these example prompts:

```
"Show me all project-related operations in the Facets API"
"What are the required parameters for creating a new project?"
"Find operations related to environment deployments"
"Show me the project schema structure with all its properties"
"Generate a TypeScript interface for the project model"
"Get the current list of projects from my environment"
"Show me details of a specific project named 'my-production-project'"
"What environments are running in my Facets environment?"
"Create an example API call to get project information"
"Find all endpoints that handle artifact routing"
"What authentication methods are available in the API?"
```

   # or
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

### Testing the MCP Server

```bash
# Start the MCP server (will wait for stdin input)
uv run control-plane-openapi-mcp

# Test with custom OpenAPI URL
FACETS_OPENAPI_URL="https://your-instance.com/v3/api-docs" uv run control-plane-openapi-mcp
```
