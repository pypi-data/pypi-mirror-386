   abstract = {Doublets are prevalent in single-cell sequencing data and can lead to artifactual findings. A number of strategies have therefore been proposed to detect them. Building on the strengths of existing approaches, we developed scDblFinder, a fast, flexible and accurate Bioconductor-based doublet detection method. Here we present the method, justify its design choices, demonstrate its performance on both single-cell RNA and accessibility (ATAC) sequencing data, and provide some observations on doublet formation, detection, and enrichment analysis. Even in complex datasets, scDblFinder can accurately identify most heterotypic doublets, and was already found by an independent benchmark to outcompete alternatives.},

   abstract = {Despite their crucial role in health and disease, our knowledge of immune cells within human tissues remains limited. We surveyed the immune compartment of 16 tissues from 12 adult donors by single-cell RNA sequencing and VDJ sequencing generating a dataset of ~360,000 cells. To systematically resolve immune cell heterogeneity across tissues, we developed CellTypist, a machine learning tool for rapid and precise cell type annotation. Using this approach, combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells. Our multitissue approach lays the foundation for identifying highly resolved immune cell types by leveraging a common reference dataset, tissue-integrated expression analysis, and antigen receptor sequencing.},

@article{Fang2023,
   abstract = {Motivation: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a commonly used algorithm for characterizing gene expression changes. However, the currently available tools used to perform GSEA have a limited ability to analyze large datasets, which is particularly problematic for the analysis of single-cell data. To overcome this limitation, we developed a GSEA package in Python (GSEApy), which could efficiently analyze large single-cell datasets. Results: We present a package (GSEApy) that performs GSEA in either the command line or Python environment. GSEApy uses a Rust implementation to enable it to calculate the same enrichment statistic as GSEA for a collection of pathways. The Rust implementation of GSEApy is 3-fold faster than the Numpy version of GSEApy (v0.10.8) and uses >4-fold less memory. GSEApy also provides an interface between Python and Enrichr web services, as well as for BioMart. The Enrichr application programming interface enables GSEApy to perform over-representation analysis for an input gene list. Furthermore, GSEApy consists of several tools, each designed to facilitate a particular type of enrichment analysis.},
