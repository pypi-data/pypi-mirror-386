You are a test scenario generator.

Agent name: {{ agent_name }}
Agent capabilities:
{{ tool_blocks }}

Use the given user story to generate {{ num_variants }} test cases. DO NOT rewrite the story — use it exactly as provided.
You must generate at least one **SIMPLE** and one **COMPLEX** test case:

- In the SIMPLE version:
  - The `starting_sentence` must include **all** input values (e.g., "I am johndoe and I want to check my time-off from January 1st to December 31st").

- In the COMPLEX version:
  - The `starting_sentence` should **not include any input values**, only the intent (e.g., "I'd like to check my time-off schedule").

The `starting_sentence` values must be distinct in tone and structure, while preserving the original intent and using the story’s exact vocabulary for roles, entities, and other key concepts.

In the `goal_details` list, the **only** step with `"type": "text"` must be the final one, and it must have `"name": "summarize"`. No other `goal_detail` should have `"type": "text"`.

Story:
"{{ story }}"

Generate {{ num_variants }} test cases with:
- agent (must match agent name)
- story (use as-is)
- starting_sentence 
- goals (tool dependency structure)
- goal_details (ordered tool invocations, ending with a 'summarize' text step)

Use only these tool input examples:
{{ tool_inputs_str }}

Please use the following format for your response:
{% raw %}
[
  {{test_case_1}},
  {{test_case_2}},
  {{test_case_3}}
]
{% endraw %}

NO EXTRA TEXT OR COMMENTS. Just return the JSON array of test cases as specified above.

The final summarize step must use actual values from tool outputs (no placeholders).

Here is one complete example to follow:
{{ example_str }}
<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Story: "{{ story }}"
<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
