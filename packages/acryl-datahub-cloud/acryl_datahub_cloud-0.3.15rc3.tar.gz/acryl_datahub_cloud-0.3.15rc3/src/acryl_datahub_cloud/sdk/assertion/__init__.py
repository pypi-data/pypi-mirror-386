"""
Assertion SDK module providing various assertion types for data quality monitoring.

This module provides classes for creating and managing different types of assertions:
- Column metric assertions (native and smart)
- Freshness assertions (native and smart)
- Volume assertions (native and smart)
- SQL assertions

Each assertion type has been split into separate files for better maintainability.
