            studio: The studio env to run the job with. Mutually exclusive with image.

            env: Environment variables to set inside the job.
            interruptible: Whether the job should run on interruptible instances. They are cheaper but can be preempted.

                Defaults to the studio cloud account if running with studio compute env.
                If not provided will fall back to the teamspaces default cloud account.

                This should be the name of the respective credentials secret created on the Lightning AI platform.
            cloud_account_auth: Whether to authenticate with the cloud account to pull the image.
                Required if the registry is part of a cloud provider (e.g. ECR).
            artifacts_local: The path of inside the docker container, you want to persist images from.
                CAUTION: When setting this to "/", it will effectively erase your container.
                Only supported for jobs with a docker image compute environment.
            path_mappings: Dictionary of path mappings. The keys are the path inside the container whereas the value
                represents the data-connection name and the path inside that connection.
                Should be of form

                Only applicable when submitting docker jobs.
            max_runtime: the duration (in seconds) for which to allocate the machine.
                Irrelevant for most machines, required for some of the top-end machines on GCP.
                If in doubt, set it. Won't have an effect on machines not requiring it.
                Defaults to 3h
