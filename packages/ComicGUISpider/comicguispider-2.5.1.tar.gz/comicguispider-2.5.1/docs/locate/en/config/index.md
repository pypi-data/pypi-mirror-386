1. Mapping does not need to care about the domain name, as long as it is used in the current website, as long as it meets `can access without mapping` and `the entered is not an invalid url`, the program will automatically replace it with a usable domain name, such as `wnacg.com` will be automatically replaced with the default domain name under non-proxy mapping
