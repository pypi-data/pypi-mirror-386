## EARS Technical Requirements Guide

### Using EARS for the Stack

Apply EARS patterns when documenting technical decisions and quality gates:

#### Technology Stack EARS Example
```markdown
### Ubiquitous Requirements (Baseline)
- The system shall guarantee TypeScript type safety.
- The system shall provide cross-platform compatibility.

### Event-driven Requirements
- WHEN code is committed, the system shall run tests automatically.
- WHEN a build fails, the system shall notify developers immediately.

### State-driven Requirements
- WHILE in development mode, the system shall offer hot reloading.
- WHILE in production mode, the system shall produce optimized builds.

### Optional Features
- WHERE Docker is available, the system may support container-based deployment.
- WHERE CI/CD is configured, the system may execute automated deployments.

### Constraints
- IF a dependency vulnerability is detected, the system shall halt the build.
- Test coverage shall remain at or above 85%.
- Build time shall not exceed 5 minutes.
```
