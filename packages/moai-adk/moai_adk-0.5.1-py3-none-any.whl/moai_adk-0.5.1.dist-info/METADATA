## What is MoAI-ADK?

### The Problem: Trust Crisis in AI Development

Today, countless developers want help from Claude or ChatGPT, but can't shake one fundamental doubt: **"Can I really trust the code this AI generates?"**

The reality looks like this. Ask an AI to "build a login feature" and you'll get syntactically perfect code. But these problems keep repeating:

- **Unclear Requirements**: The basic question "What exactly should we build?" remains unanswered. Email/password login? OAuth? 2FA? Everything relies on guessing.
- **Missing Tests**: Most AIs only test the "happy path". Wrong password? Network error? Three months later, bugs explode in production.
- **Documentation Drift**: Code gets modified but docs stay the same. The question "Why is this code here?" keeps repeating.
- **Context Loss**: Even within the same project, you have to explain everything from scratch each time. Project structure, decision rationale, previous attempts—nothing gets recorded.
- **Impact Tracking Impossible**: When requirements change, you can't track which code is affected.

### The Solution: SPEC-First TDD with Alfred SuperAgent

**MoAI-ADK** (MoAI Agentic Development Kit) is an open-source framework designed to **systematically solve** these problems.

The core principle is simple yet powerful:

> **"No tests without code, no SPEC without tests"**

More precisely, it's the reverse order:

> **"SPEC comes first. No tests without SPEC. No complete documentation without tests and code."**

When you follow this order, magical things happen:

**1️⃣ Clear Requirements**
Write SPECs first with the `/alfred:1-plan` command. A vague request like "login feature" transforms into **clear requirements** like "WHEN valid credentials are provided, the system SHALL issue a JWT token". Alfred's spec-builder uses EARS syntax to create professional SPECs in just 3 minutes.

**2️⃣ Test Guarantee**
`/alfred:2-run` automatically performs Test-Driven Development (TDD). It proceeds in RED (failing test) → GREEN (minimal implementation) → REFACTOR (cleanup) order, **guaranteeing 85%+ test coverage**. No more "testing later". Tests drive code creation.

**3️⃣ Automatic Documentation Sync**
A single `/alfred:3-sync` command **synchronizes** all code, tests, and documentation. README, CHANGELOG, API docs, and Living Documents all update automatically. Six months later, code and docs still match.

**4️⃣ Tracking with @TAG System**
Every piece of code, test, and documentation gets a `@TAG:ID`. When requirements change later, one command—`rg "@SPEC:AUTH-001"`—**finds all related tests, implementations, and docs**. You gain confidence during refactoring.

**5️⃣ Alfred Remembers Context**
A team of AI agents collaborate to **remember** your project's structure, decision rationale, and work history. No need to repeat the same questions.

### MoAI-ADK's 3 Core Promises

For beginners to remember easily, MoAI-ADK's value simplifies to three things:

**First, SPEC comes before code**
Start by clearly defining what to build. Writing SPEC helps discover problems before implementation. Communication costs with teammates drop dramatically.

**Second, tests drive code (TDD)**
Write tests before implementation (RED). Implement minimally to pass tests (GREEN). Then clean up the code (REFACTOR). Result: fewer bugs, confidence in refactoring, code anyone can understand.

**Third, documentation and code always match**
One `/alfred:3-sync` command auto-updates all documentation. README, CHANGELOG, API docs, and Living Documents always sync with code. No more despair when modifying six-month-old code.

## Why Do You Need It?

### Real Challenges in AI Development

Modern AI-powered development faces various challenges. MoAI-ADK **systematically solves** all these problems:

| Concern                         | Traditional Approach Problem                       | MoAI-ADK Solution                                             |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Can't trust AI code"           | Implementation without tests, unclear verification | Enforces SPEC → TEST → CODE order, guarantees 85%+ coverage   |
| "Repeating same explanations"   | Context loss, unrecorded project history           | Alfred remembers everything, 19 AI team members collaborate   |
| "Hard to write prompts"         | Don't know how to write good prompts               | `/alfred` commands provide standardized prompts automatically |
| "Documentation always outdated" | Forget to update docs after code changes           | `/alfred:3-sync` auto-syncs with one command                  |
| "Don't know what changed where" | Hard to search code, unclear intent                | @TAG chain connects SPEC → TEST → CODE → DOC                  |
| "Team onboarding takes forever" | New members can't grasp code context               | Reading SPEC makes intent immediately clear                   |

### Benefits You Can Experience Right Now

From the moment you adopt MoAI-ADK, you'll feel:

- **Faster Development**: Clear SPEC reduces round-trip explanation time
- **Fewer Bugs**: SPEC-based tests catch issues early
- **Better Code Understanding**: @TAG and SPEC make intent immediately clear
- **Lower Maintenance Costs**: Code and docs always match
- **Efficient Team Collaboration**: Clear communication through SPEC and TAG

## 5-Minute Quick Start

Now let's start your first project with MoAI-ADK. Follow these 5 steps and in just **5 minutes** you'll have a project with SPEC, TDD, and documentation all connected.

### Step 1: Install uv (about 30 seconds)

First, install `uv`. `uv` is an ultra-fast Python package manager written in Rust. It's **10+ times faster** than traditional `pip` and works perfectly with MoAI-ADK.

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Verify installation
uv --version
# Output: uv 0.x.x
```

**Why uv?** MoAI-ADK is optimized to leverage uv's fast installation speed and stability. Perfect project isolation means no impact on other Python environments.

### Step 2: Install MoAI-ADK (about 1 minute)

Install MoAI-ADK as a global tool. This won't affect your project dependencies.

```bash
# Install in tool mode (recommended: runs in isolated environment)
uv tool install moai-adk

# Verify installation
moai-adk --version
# Output: MoAI-ADK v0.4.11
```

Once installed, you can use the `moai-adk` command anywhere.

### Step 3: Create Project (about 1 minute)

**To start a new project:**
```bash
moai-adk init my-project
cd my-project
```

**To add to an existing project:**
```bash
cd your-existing-project
moai-adk init .
```

This one command automatically generates:

```
my-project/
├── .moai/                   # MoAI-ADK project configuration
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── project/             # Project information
│   ├── specs/               # SPEC files
│   └── reports/             # Analysis reports
├── .claude/                 # Claude Code automation
│   ├── agents/              # AI team
│   ├── commands/            # /alfred commands
│   ├── skills/              # Claude Skills
│   └── settings.json
├── src/                     # Implementation code
├── tests/                   # Test code
├── docs/                    # Auto-generated documentation
└── README.md
```

### Step 4: Start Alfred in Claude Code (about 2 minutes)

Run Claude Code and invoke the Alfred SuperAgent:

```bash
# Run Claude Code
claude
```

Then enter this in Claude Code's command input:

```
/alfred:0-project
```

This command performs:

1. **Collect Project Info**: "Project name?", "Goals?", "Main language?"
2. **Auto-detect Tech Stack**: Automatically recognizes Python/JavaScript/Go, etc.
3. **Deploy Skill Packs**: Prepares necessary Skills for your project
4. **Generate Initial Report**: Project structure, suggested next steps

### Step 5: Write First SPEC (about 1 minute)

After project initialization completes, write your first feature as a SPEC:

```
/alfred:1-plan "User registration feature"
```

Automatically generated:
- `@SPEC:USER-001` - Unique ID assigned
- `.moai/specs/SPEC-USER-001/spec.md` - Professional SPEC in EARS format
- `feature/spec-user-001` - Git branch auto-created

### Step 6: TDD Implementation (about 3 minutes)

Once SPEC is written, implement using TDD:

```
/alfred:2-run USER-001
```

This command handles:
- 🔴 **RED**: Automatically write failing test (`@TEST:USER-001`)
- 🟢 **GREEN**: Minimal implementation to pass test (`@CODE:USER-001`)
- ♻️ **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality

### Step 7: Documentation Sync (about 1 minute)

Finally, auto-sync all documentation:

```
/alfred:3-sync
```

Automatically generated/updated:
- Living Document (API documentation)
- README updates
- CHANGELOG generation
- @TAG chain validation

### Complete!

After these 7 steps, everything is ready:

✅ Requirements specification (SPEC)
✅ Test code (85%+ coverage)
✅ Implementation code (tracked with @TAG)
✅ API documentation (auto-generated)
✅ Change history (CHANGELOG)
✅ Git commit history (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR)

**Everything completes in 15 minutes!**

### Verify Generated Results

Check if the generated results were properly created:

```bash
# 1. Check TAG chain (SPEC → TEST → CODE → DOC)
rg '@(SPEC|TEST|CODE):USER-001' -n

# 2. Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# 3. Check generated documentation
cat docs/api/user.md
cat README.md
```

> 🔍 **Verification Command**: `moai-adk doctor` — Checks if Python/uv versions, `.moai/` structure, and agent/Skills configuration are all ready.
> ```bash
> moai-adk doctor
> ```
> All green checkmarks mean perfect readiness!

---

## Keeping MoAI-ADK Up-to-Date

### Check Version
```bash
# Check currently installed version
moai-adk --version

# Check latest version on PyPI
uv tool list  # Check current version of moai-adk
```

### Upgrading

#### Method 1: MoAI-ADK Built-in Update Command (Simplest)
```bash
# MoAI-ADK's own update command - also updates agent/Skills templates
moai-adk update

# Apply new templates to project after update (optional)
moai-adk init .
```

#### Method 2: Upgrade with uv tool command

**Upgrade specific tool (recommended)**
```bash
# Upgrade only moai-adk to latest version
uv tool upgrade moai-adk
```

**Upgrade all installed tools**
```bash
# Upgrade all uv tool installations to latest versions
uv tool update
```

**Install specific version**
```bash
# Reinstall specific version (e.g., 0.4.2)
uv tool install moai-adk==0.4.2
```

### Verify After Update
```bash
# 1. Check installed version
moai-adk --version

# 2. Verify project works correctly
moai-adk doctor

# 3. Apply new templates to existing project (if needed)
cd your-project
moai-adk init .  # Keeps existing code, updates only .moai/ structure and templates

# 4. Check updated features in Alfred
cd your-project
claude
/alfred:0-project  # Verify new features like language selection
```

> 💡 **Tip**:
> - `moai-adk update`: Updates MoAI-ADK package version + syncs agent/Skills templates
> - `moai-adk init .`: Applies new templates to existing project (keeps code safe)
> - Running both commands completes a full update
> - When major updates (minor/major) release, run these procedures to utilize new agents/Skills

## 5 Key Concepts

MoAI-ADK consists of 5 key concepts. Each concept connects to the others, and together they create a powerful development system.

### Key Concept 1: SPEC-First (Requirements First)

**Metaphor**: Like building a house without an architect, you shouldn't code without a blueprint.

**Core Idea**: Before implementation, **clearly define "what to build"**. This isn't just documentation—it's an **executable spec** that both teams and AI can understand.

**EARS Syntax 5 Patterns**:

1. **Ubiquitous** (basic function): "The system SHALL provide JWT-based authentication"
2. **Event-driven** (conditional): "WHEN valid credentials are provided, the system SHALL issue a token"
3. **State-driven** (during state): "WHILE the user is authenticated, the system SHALL allow access to protected resources"
4. **Optional** (optional): "WHERE a refresh token exists, the system MAY issue a new token"
5. **Constraints** (constraints): "Token expiration time SHALL NOT exceed 15 minutes"

**How?** The `/alfred:1-plan` command automatically creates professional SPECs in EARS format.

**What You Get**:
- ✅ Clear requirements everyone on the team understands
- ✅ SPEC-based test cases (what to test is already defined)
- ✅ When requirements change, track all affected code with `@SPEC:ID` TAG

---

### Key Concept 2: TDD (Test-Driven Development)

**Metaphor**: Like finding the route after setting a destination, you set goals with tests, then write code.

**Core Idea**: Write tests **before** implementation. Like checking ingredients before cooking, this clarifies requirements before implementation.

**3-Step Cycle**:

1. **🔴 RED**: Write a failing test first
   - Each SPEC requirement becomes a test case
   - Must fail because implementation doesn't exist yet
   - Git commit: `test(AUTH-001): add failing test`

2. **🟢 GREEN**: Minimal implementation to pass the test
   - Make it pass using the simplest approach
   - Passing comes before perfection
   - Git commit: `feat(AUTH-001): implement minimal solution`

3. **♻️ REFACTOR**: Clean up and improve code
   - Apply TRUST 5 principles
   - Remove duplication, improve readability
   - Tests must still pass
   - Git commit: `refactor(AUTH-001): improve code quality`

**How?** The `/alfred:2-run` command automatically executes these 3 steps.

**What You Get**:
- ✅ Guaranteed 85%+ coverage (no code without tests)
- ✅ Refactoring confidence (always verifiable with tests)
- ✅ Clear Git history (trace RED → GREEN → REFACTOR process)

---

### Key Concept 3: @TAG System

**Metaphor**: Like package tracking numbers, you should be able to trace code's journey.

**Core Idea**: Add `@TAG:ID` to all SPECs, tests, code, and documentation to create **one-to-one correspondence**.

**TAG Chain**:
```
@SPEC:AUTH-001 (requirements)
    ↓
@TEST:AUTH-001 (test)
    ↓
@CODE:AUTH-001 (implementation)
    ↓
@DOC:AUTH-001 (documentation)
```

**TAG ID Rules**: `<Domain>-<3 digits>`
- AUTH-001, AUTH-002, AUTH-003...
- USER-001, USER-002...
- Once assigned, **never change**

**How to Use?** When requirements change:
```bash
# Find everything related to AUTH-001
rg '@TAG:AUTH-001' -n

# Result: Shows all SPEC, TEST, CODE, DOC at once
# → Clear what needs modification
```

**How?** The `/alfred:3-sync` command validates TAG chains and detects orphan TAGs (TAGs without correspondence).

**What You Get**:
- ✅ Clear intent for all code (reading SPEC explains why this code exists)
- ✅ Instantly identify all affected code during refactoring
- ✅ Code remains understandable 3 months later (trace TAG → SPEC)

---

### Key Concept 4: TRUST 5 Principles

**Metaphor**: Like a healthy body, good code must satisfy all 5 elements.

**Core Idea**: All code must follow these 5 principles. `/alfred:3-sync` automatically verifies them.

1. **🧪 Test First** (tests come first)
   - Test coverage ≥ 85%
   - All code protected by tests
   - Adding feature = adding test

2. **📖 Readable** (easy-to-read code)
   - Functions ≤ 50 lines, files ≤ 300 lines
   - Variable names reveal intent
   - Pass linters (ESLint/ruff/clippy)

3. **🎯 Unified** (consistent structure)
   - Maintain SPEC-based architecture
   - Same patterns repeat (reduces learning curve)
   - Type safety or runtime validation

4. **🔒 Secured** (security)
   - Input validation (defend against XSS, SQL Injection)
   - Password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
   - Protect sensitive information (environment variables)

5. **🔗 Trackable** (traceability)
   - Use @TAG system
   - Include TAG in Git commits
   - Document all decisions

**How?** The `/alfred:3-sync` command automatically performs TRUST verification.

**What You Get**:
- ✅ Production-quality code guaranteed
- ✅ Entire team develops with same standards
- ✅ Fewer bugs, prevent security vulnerabilities in advance

---

### Key Concept 5: Alfred SuperAgent

**Metaphor**: Like a personal assistant, Alfred handles all the complex work.

**Core Idea**: **19 AI agents** collaborate to automate the entire development process:

**Agent Composition**:
- **Alfred SuperAgent**: Overall orchestration (1)
- **Core Sub-agents**: Specialized tasks like SPEC writing, TDD implementation, documentation sync (10)
- **Zero-project Specialists**: Project initialization, language detection, etc. (6)
- **Built-in Agents**: General questions, codebase exploration (2)

**55 Claude Skills**:
- **Foundation** (6): TRUST/TAG/SPEC/Git/EARS principles
- **Essentials** (4): Debugging, performance, refactoring, code review
- **Alfred** (7): Workflow automation
- **Domain** (10): Backend, frontend, security, etc.
- **Language** (18): Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, C/C#, Ruby, PHP, SQL, Shell, and more
- **Ops** (1): Claude Code session management
- **Other** (2): Skill factory, Spec authoring

**How?** `/alfred:*` commands automatically activate the right expert team.

**What You Get**:
- ✅ No prompt writing needed (use standardized commands)
- ✅ Automatically remember project context (no repeating same questions)
- ✅ Auto-assemble optimal expert team (activate appropriate Sub-agents)

## First Hands-on: Todo API Example

Let's now **experience MoAI-ADK's complete workflow** firsthand. We'll build a simple "Todo Management API" and see how SPEC, TDD, and documentation connect.

### Step 1: PLAN - Write SPEC (about 3 minutes)

```bash
/alfred:1-plan "Todo add, view, update, delete API"
```

**Execution Result**:

Alfred's **spec-builder** automatically generates:

```yaml
# .moai/specs/SPEC-TODO-001/spec.md

---
id: TODO-001
version: 0.0.1
status: draft
created: 2025-10-22
updated: 2025-10-22
author: @user
priority: high
---

# @SPEC:TODO-001: Todo Management API

## Ubiquitous Requirements
- The system SHALL be able to add todos
- The system SHALL be able to view all todos
- The system SHALL be able to update specific todos
- The system SHALL be able to delete todos

## Event-driven Requirements
- WHEN a new todo is requested via POST /todos, the system SHALL save the todo and return a 201 response
- WHEN GET /todos/{id} is requested with an existing todo ID, the system SHALL return that todo
- WHEN GET is requested with a non-existent todo ID, the system SHALL return a 404 error

## Constraints
- Todo title SHALL be minimum 1 character, maximum 200 characters
- Each todo SHALL automatically record creation time
```

- 📋 `Plan Board`: Implementation ideas, risk factors, solution strategies
- ✅ `Acceptance Criteria`: Verification standards
- 🌿 `feature/spec-todo-001` Git branch

### Step 2: RUN - TDD Implementation (about 5 minutes)

```bash
/alfred:2-run TODO-001
```

**Phase 1: Establish Implementation Strategy**

The **implementation-planner** Sub-agent decides:
- 📚 Libraries: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
- 📁 Folder structure: `src/todo/`, `tests/todo/`
- 🏷️ TAG design: `@CODE:TODO-001:API`, `@CODE:TODO-001:MODEL`, `@CODE:TODO-001:REPO`

**Phase 2: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR**

**🔴 RED: Write Tests First**

```python
# tests/test_todo_api.py
# @TEST:TODO-001 | SPEC: SPEC-TODO-001.md

import pytest
from src.todo.api import create_todo, get_todos

def test_create_todo_should_return_201_with_todo_id():
    """WHEN a new todo is requested via POST /todos,
    the system SHALL save the todo and return a 201 response"""
    response = create_todo({"title": "Buy groceries"})
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert "id" in response.json()
    assert response.json()["title"] == "Buy groceries"

def test_get_todos_should_return_all_todos():
    """The system SHALL be able to view all todos"""
    create_todo({"title": "Task 1"})
    create_todo({"title": "Task 2"})

    response = get_todos()
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert len(response.json()) >= 2

def test_get_todo_with_invalid_id_should_return_404():
    """WHEN GET is requested with a non-existent todo ID,
    the system SHALL return a 404 error"""
    response = get_todo(999)
    assert response.status_code == 404
```

**Execute**: `pytest tests/test_todo_api.py -v`
**Result**: ❌ All fail (create_todo not defined)

**Git Commit**:
```bash
git commit -m "🔴 test(TODO-001): add failing API tests"
```

**🟢 GREEN: Minimal Implementation**

```python
# src/todo/api.py
# @CODE:TODO-001:API | SPEC: SPEC-TODO-001.md | TEST: tests/test_todo_api.py

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import uuid

app = FastAPI()
todos_db = {}

class TodoRequest(BaseModel):
    title: str

@app.post("/todos", status_code=201)
def create_todo(todo: TodoRequest):
    """@CODE:TODO-001:API - POST endpoint"""
    todo_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    todos_db[todo_id] = {"id": todo_id, "title": todo.title}
    return todos_db[todo_id]

@app.get("/todos")
def get_todos():
    """@CODE:TODO-001:API - GET all endpoint"""
    return list(todos_db.values())

@app.get("/todos/{todo_id}")
def get_todo(todo_id: str):
    """@CODE:TODO-001:API - GET by ID endpoint"""
    if todo_id not in todos_db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Todo not found")
    return todos_db[todo_id]
```

**Execute**: `pytest tests/test_todo_api.py -v`
**Result**: ✅ All pass!

**Git Commit**:
```bash
git commit -m "🟢 feat(TODO-001): implement minimal Todo API"
```

**♻️ REFACTOR: Code Improvement**

```python
# src/todo/models.py
# @CODE:TODO-001:MODEL | SPEC: SPEC-TODO-001.md

from datetime import datetime
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Todo(Base):
    """@CODE:TODO-001:MODEL - Todo data model"""
    __tablename__ = "todos"

    id = Column(String, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String(200), nullable=False, index=True)  # Constraint: max 200 chars
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)   # Auto creation time

    def validate(self):
        """@CODE:TODO-001:MODEL - Validation"""
        if not self.title or len(self.title) > 200:
            raise ValueError("Title must be 1-200 characters")
```

**Execute**: `pytest tests/test_todo_api.py -v`
**Result**: ✅ Still all pass!

**Git Commit**:
```bash
git commit -m "♻️ refactor(TODO-001): add database models and validation"
```

**Phase 3: Quality Verification**

```bash
# TRUST verification
✅ Test First: 87% coverage
✅ Readable: All functions < 50 lines
✅ Unified: Consistent API patterns
✅ Secured: Input validation complete
✅ Trackable: All code has @TAG:TODO-001
```

### Step 3: SYNC - Documentation Sync (about 1 minute)

```bash
/alfred:3-sync
```

**Automatically Performed**:

1. **TAG Chain Validation**
   ```bash
   ✅ @SPEC:TODO-001 → .moai/specs/SPEC-TODO-001/spec.md
   ✅ @TEST:TODO-001 → tests/test_todo_api.py
   ✅ @CODE:TODO-001 → src/todo/ (3 files)
   ✅ @DOC:TODO-001 → docs/api/todo.md (auto-generated)

   TAG Chain Integrity: 100%
   Orphan TAGs: None
   ```

2. **Living Document Generation**
   ```markdown

## AI Model Selection Guide

| Scenario                                             | Default Model         | Why                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Specifications, design, refactoring, problem solving | **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** | Strong in deep reasoning and structured writing |
| Document sync, TAG checks, Git automation            | **Claude 4.5 Haiku**  | Strong in rapid iteration, string processing    |

- Start with Haiku for patterned tasks; switch to Sonnet when complex judgment is needed.
- If you manually change models, noting "why switched" in logs helps collaboration.

## Claude Code Hooks Guide

MoAI-ADK provides 4 main **Claude Code Hooks** that seamlessly integrate with your development workflow. These hooks enable automatic checkpoints, JIT context loading, and session monitoring—all happening transparently in the background.

### What Are Hooks?

Hooks are **event-driven** scripts that trigger automatically at specific points in your Claude Code session. Think of them as safety guardrails and productivity boosters that work behind the scenes without interrupting your flow.

### Installed Hooks

#### 1. SessionStart (Session Initialization)

**Triggers**: When you start a Claude Code session in your project
**Purpose**: Display project status at a glance

**What You See**:
```
🚀 MoAI-ADK Session Started
   Language: Python
   Branch: develop
   Changes: 2 files
   SPEC Progress: 12/25 (48%)
```

**Why It Matters**: Instantly understand your project's current state without running multiple commands.

#### 2. PreToolUse (Before Tool Execution)

**Triggers**: Before executing file edits, Bash commands, or MultiEdit operations
**Purpose**: Detect risky operations and automatically create safety checkpoints + TAG Guard

**Protection Against**:
- `rm -rf` (file deletion)
- `git merge`, `git reset --hard` (Git dangerous operations)
- Editing critical files (`CLAUDE.md`, `config.json`)
- Mass edits (10+ files at once via MultiEdit)

**TAG Guard (New in v0.4.11)**:
Automatically detects missing @TAG annotations in changed files:
- Scans staged, modified, and untracked files
- Warns when SPEC/TEST/CODE/DOC files lack required @TAG markers
- Configurable rules via `.moai/tag-rules.json`
- Non-blocking (gentle reminder, doesn't stop execution)

**What You See**:
```
🛡️ Checkpoint created: before-delete-20251023-143000
   Operation: delete
```

Or when TAGs are missing:
```
⚠️ TAG 누락 감지: 생성/수정한 파일 중 @TAG가 없는 항목이 있습니다.
 - src/auth/service.py → 기대 태그: @CODE:
 - tests/test_auth.py → 기대 태그: @TEST:
권장 조치:
  1) SPEC/TEST/CODE/DOC 유형에 맞는 @TAG를 파일 상단 주석이나 헤더에 추가
  2) rg로 확인: rg '@(SPEC|TEST|CODE|DOC):' -n <경로>
```

**Why It Matters**: Prevents data loss from mistakes and ensures @TAG traceability. You can always restore from the checkpoint if something goes wrong.

#### 3. UserPromptSubmit (Prompt Input)

**Triggers**: When you submit a prompt to Claude
**Purpose**: JIT (Just-In-Time) context loading—automatically add relevant files

**How It Works**:
- You type: "Fix AUTH bug"
- Hook scans for AUTH-related files
- Auto-loads: SPEC, tests, implementation, docs related to AUTH
- Claude receives full context without you manually specifying files

**Why It Matters**: Saves time and ensures Claude has all the relevant context for your request.

#### 4. SessionEnd (Session Cleanup)

**Triggers**: When you close your Claude Code session
**Purpose**: Cleanup tasks and state preservation

**Why It Matters**: Ensures clean session transitions and proper state management.

### Technical Details

- **Location**: `.claude/hooks/alfred/`
- **Environment Variable**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (dynamically references project root)
- **Performance**: Each hook executes in <100ms
- **Logging**: Errors output to stderr (stdout reserved for JSON payloads)

### How to Disable Hooks

If you need to temporarily disable hooks, edit `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [],     // Disabled
    "PreToolUse": [...]     // Still active
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: Hook doesn't execute**
- ✅ Verify `.claude/settings.json` is properly configured
- ✅ Check `uv` is installed: `which uv`
- ✅ Ensure hook script has execute permissions: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/alfred/alfred_hooks.py`

**Problem: Performance degradation**
- ✅ Check if any hook exceeds 100ms execution time
- ✅ Disable unnecessary hooks
- ✅ Review error messages in stderr output

**Problem: Too many checkpoints created**
- ✅ Review PreToolUse trigger conditions
- ✅ Adjust detection thresholds in `core/checkpoint.py` if needed

### Installed Hooks (5 total)

| Hook | Status | Feature |
|------|--------|---------|
| **SessionStart** | ✅ Active | Project status summary (language, Git, SPEC progress, checkpoints) |
| **PreToolUse** | ✅ Active | Risk detection + auto checkpoint (critical-delete, delete, merge, script) + **TAG Guard** (missing @TAG detection) |
| **UserPromptSubmit** | ✅ Active | JIT context loading (auto-load related SPEC, tests, code, docs) |
| **PostToolUse** | ✅ Active | Auto-run tests after code changes (9 languages: Python, TS, JS, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Dart) |
| **SessionEnd** | ✅ Active | Session cleanup and state saving |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q. Can I install on an existing project?**
  - A. Yes. Run `moai-adk init .` to add only the `.moai/` structure without touching existing code.
- **Q. How do I run tests?**
  - A. `/alfred:2-run` runs them first; rerun `pytest`, `pnpm test`, etc. per language as needed.
- **Q. How do I ensure documentation stays current?**
  - A. `/alfred:3-sync` generates a Sync Report. Check the report in Pull Requests.
- **Q. Can I work manually?**
  - A. Yes, but keep the SPEC → TEST → CODE → DOC order and always leave TAGs.
