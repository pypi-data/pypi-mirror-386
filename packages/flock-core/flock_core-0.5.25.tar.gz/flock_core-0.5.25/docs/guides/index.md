## Best Practices

### Design Patterns
- ✅ Use small, focused agents with single responsibilities
- ✅ Leverage type contracts for implicit coordination
- ✅ Design artifacts as immutable domain events
- ✅ Enable batching for independent parallel work

### Performance
- ✅ Use `run_until_idle()` after batching publishes
- ✅ Enable auto-tracing only in dev/staging
- ✅ Set appropriate trace TTL for storage management
- ✅ Filter trace services to reduce overhead

### Production
- ✅ Implement proper visibility controls
- ✅ Monitor with production tracing
- ✅ Set up alerting on error rates
- ✅ Use correlation IDs for request tracking
