# üó∫Ô∏è Flock Roadmap to 1.0

**Building Enterprise Infrastructure for AI Agents**

This roadmap outlines Flock's path from v0.5.0 (production-ready core) to v1.0 (enterprise-complete) by Q4 2025.

We're confident to deliver all enterprise features in a single release: **Flock 1.0 in Q4 2025**.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Production-Ready (v0.5.0)

### Core Framework
- [x] Blackboard orchestrator with typed artifacts
- [x] Declarative agent subscriptions (no graph wiring)
- [x] Parallel + sequential execution (automatic)
- [x] Zero-trust security (5 visibility types)
- [x] Circuit breakers and feedback loop prevention
- [x] 743 tests with 77.65% coverage (86-100% on critical paths)
- [x] Type-safe retrieval API (`get_by_type()`)

### Observability
- [x] OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- [x] DuckDB trace storage (AI-queryable)
- [x] Real-time dashboard with WebSocket streaming
- [x] 7-mode trace viewer (Timeline, RED metrics, Dependencies, SQL)
- [x] Service filtering and CSV export
- [x] Full I/O capture with JSON viewer

### Developer Experience
- [x] MCP integration (Model Context Protocol)
- [x] Best-of-N execution
- [x] Batch processing and join operations
- [x] Conditional consumption (`where=lambda`)
- [x] Rich console output and FastAPI service
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)

    confidence: float

@flock_type
class LabResults(BaseModel):
    markers: dict[str, float]

@flock_type
class Diagnosis(BaseModel):
    condition: str
    reasoning: str
    confidence: float
