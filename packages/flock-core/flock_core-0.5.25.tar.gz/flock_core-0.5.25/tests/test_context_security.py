        - Visibility filtering was NOT enforced at context level
        - Agents could access private/tenant/classified data
        - Attack: Data leakage, tenant isolation bypass, RBAC bypass

        VULNERABILITY #2 (WRITE BYPASS):
        - Agents could call ctx.board.publish() to publish ANY artifact
        - Validation was NOT enforced (agent._make_outputs_for_group validated, but engines could bypass)
        - Agents could forge produced_by, visibility, correlation_id
        - Attack: Publish invalid data, impersonate other agents, declassify secrets

        VULNERABILITY #3 (GOD MODE):
        - Agents had direct ctx.orchestrator access
        - Could access internal state (_agents, _subscriptions, store, config)
        - Could perform orchestrator-level operations
        - Attack: Complete privilege escalation, system manipulation

        VULNERABILITY #4 (STORE ACCESS - Phase 8):
        - Engines could access ctx.store or ctx.provider to query arbitrary data
        - Even with provider security boundary, engines could bypass by calling methods
        - Engines could query cross-workflow data, bypass filters
        - Attack: Access control bypass, data exfiltration

        - Remove board and orchestrator from Context (Phases 1-6)
