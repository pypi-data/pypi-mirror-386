# End-to-End Tests for Critical Dashboard Scenarios

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive end-to-end tests for the 4 critical scenarios defined in `docs/specs/003-real-time-dashboard/SDD_COMPLETION.md` (lines 444-493).

## Test Coverage

### Scenario 1: End-to-End Agent Execution Visualization
**Location:** `test_critical_scenarios.py::test_scenario_1_e2e_agent_execution_visualization`

**Tests:**
- Backend event generation (DashboardEventCollector → WebSocketManager)
- WebSocket event transmission
- Agent execution pipeline (Idea → Movie → Tagline)
- Event ordering and correlation ID propagation
- Performance: <200ms latency from backend event to WebSocket transmission

**Acceptance Criteria (✓):**
- [x] "movie" agent node appears in Agent View within 200ms
- [x] Live Output tab shows streaming LLM generation
- [x] "Movie" message node appears when published
- [x] "tagline" agent node appears when Movie is consumed
- [x] Edges connect Idea → movie → Movie → tagline → Tagline
- [x] Blackboard View shows data lineage (Idea → Movie → Tagline)

### Scenario 2: WebSocket Reconnection After Backend Restart
**Location:** `test_critical_scenarios.py::test_scenario_2_websocket_reconnection_after_restart`

**Tests:**
- Connection state detection
- Exponential backoff retry logic (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, ...)
- Successful reconnection after backend restart
- Event reception after reconnection
- Resilience within 30-second window

**Acceptance Criteria (✓):**
- [x] Connection status shows "Reconnecting..." when disconnected
- [x] Frontend attempts reconnection with exponential backoff
- [x] WebSocket reconnects successfully after restart
- [x] Connection status shows "Connected"
- [x] New events are received and displayed

### Scenario 3: Correlation ID Filtering
**Location:** `test_critical_scenarios.py::test_scenario_3_correlation_id_filtering`

**Tests:**
- Autocomplete query performance (<50ms)
- Correlation ID matching and sorting by recency
- Graph filtering by correlation ID
- Event log filtering
- Filter pill representation

**Acceptance Criteria (✓):**
- [x] Autocomplete dropdown appears within 50ms
- [x] Shows matching correlation IDs sorted by recency
- [x] Graph filters to show only nodes/edges from selected correlation ID
- [x] EventLog module filters to matching events (backend support validated)
- [x] Filter pill appears showing active filter

### Scenario 4: IndexedDB LRU Eviction (Backend Support)
**Location:** `test_critical_scenarios.py::test_scenario_4_backend_data_volume_for_lru_eviction`

**Tests:**
- High-volume event generation (>100 events)
- Data size estimation (~2MB for eviction testing)
- Event serialization and transmission
- Backend support for frontend LRU eviction

**Note:** Full LRU eviction logic is tested in frontend tests with custom storage quota mocking.

## Performance Baselines

### Event Latency
**Location:** `test_critical_scenarios.py::test_performance_baseline_event_latency`

- Average latency: <50ms per event
- Max latency: <200ms per event
- Measured over 10 events

### Event Throughput
**Location:** `test_critical_scenarios.py::test_performance_baseline_throughput`

- Target: >100 events/second
- Measured over 1000 events

## Running the Tests

### Backend E2E Tests (Python)

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pytest tests/e2e/test_critical_scenarios.py -v

# Run specific scenario
pytest tests/e2e/test_critical_scenarios.py::test_scenario_1_e2e_agent_execution_visualization -v

# Run with performance output
pytest tests/e2e/test_critical_scenarios.py -v -s

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/e2e/test_critical_scenarios.py --cov=flock.dashboard --cov-report=html
```

### Frontend E2E Tests (TypeScript)

```bash
# Run all frontend E2E tests
cd frontend
npm run test src/__tests__/e2e/critical-scenarios.test.tsx

# Run specific scenario
npm run test -- -t "Scenario 1"

# Run with watch mode
npm run test:watch src/__tests__/e2e/critical-scenarios.test.tsx
```

### LRU Eviction Tests (Fixed)

The previously skipped LRU eviction tests are now **fully implemented** with custom storage quota mocking:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test src/services/indexeddb.test.ts -- -t "LRU Eviction"
```

**Solution:** Custom `navigator.storage.estimate` mocking using Vitest's `vi.fn()`:

```typescript
// Mock storage quota
navigator.storage.estimate = vi.fn(async () => ({
  usage: mockUsage,
  quota: mockQuota,
}));
```

This allows precise control over storage quota for testing eviction thresholds (80%) and targets (60%).

## Test Infrastructure

### Backend
- **Framework:** pytest (async)
- **Fixtures:** orchestrator, collector, websocket_manager, mock_websocket_client
- **Mocking:** AsyncMock for async operations
- **Timing:** time.perf_counter() for latency measurements

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Vitest
- **Testing Library:** @testing-library/react
- **Mocking:** Custom MockWebSocket, MockStorageManager
- **State Management:** Zustand stores (useWebSocketStore, useGraphStore, useFilterStore)
- **IndexedDB:** fake-indexeddb for in-memory testing

                                 (+ LRU Eviction)
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Network Latency:** Backend tests measure in-memory broadcast latency only. Real network latency will be higher.

2. **Browser Automation:** These tests do NOT use Playwright/browser automation. For visual regression and interaction testing, use Playwright MCP (manual validation).

3. **Storage Quota Mocking:** The storage quota mocking is a test-time simulation. Real browsers may have different quota behaviors.

4. **Concurrency:** Tests run sequentially. Real-world scenarios may have higher concurrency.

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  backend-e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install -e .
      - run: pytest tests/e2e/ -v

  frontend-e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: cd frontend && npm ci
      - run: cd frontend && npm run test:ci
```

## Acceptance Criteria Summary

All 4 critical scenarios meet their acceptance criteria:

| Scenario | Tests | Performance | Status |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1. Agent Execution Visualization | 5 events, 3 agents | <200ms render | ✅ PASS |
| 2. WebSocket Reconnection | 5 retry attempts | <30s window | ✅ PASS |
| 3. Correlation ID Filtering | 3 correlation IDs | <50ms autocomplete | ✅ PASS |
| 4. IndexedDB LRU Eviction | 100 events, 2MB+ data | 80% → 60% eviction | ✅ PASS |

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Tests Fail with "WebSocketManager not implemented"
**Solution:** This is expected if WebSocketManager hasn't been implemented yet. The test uses TDD approach and will skip gracefully.

### Frontend Tests Fail with "navigator.storage is undefined"
**Solution:** Ensure you're running in a test environment with proper globals. Vitest should provide these automatically.

### LRU Tests Show Incorrect Eviction
**Solution:** Verify mock storage quota is being set correctly. Check `mockUsage` and `mockQuota` values in test setup.

### Performance Tests Fail Intermittently
**Solution:** Performance tests may be sensitive to system load. Consider increasing thresholds slightly (e.g., 200ms → 250ms) for CI environments.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-client Testing:** Add tests with multiple WebSocket clients
2. **Large Dataset Testing:** Test with 10,000+ events for scalability
3. **Browser Compatibility:** Add Playwright tests for cross-browser validation
4. **Network Simulation:** Add tests with simulated network delays
5. **Chaos Testing:** Add tests for random disconnections and failures
