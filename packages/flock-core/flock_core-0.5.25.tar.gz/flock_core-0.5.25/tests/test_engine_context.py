"""Tests for Engine Context Reading - Phase 8.

This test suite verifies that engines read pre-filtered context from ctx.artifacts
instead of querying data themselves.

Phase 8 fixes ALL context security vulnerabilities:
- Orchestrator evaluates context BEFORE creating Context
- Context contains ONLY pre-filtered artifacts (no provider/store)
- Engines are pure functions: input + ctx.artifacts â†’ output
- Engines CANNOT query for more data (no capabilities)

The secure pattern (Phase 8):
- Orchestrator uses provider to evaluate context
- Orchestrator creates Context with pre-filtered artifacts
- Engine reads ctx.artifacts (no querying!)
