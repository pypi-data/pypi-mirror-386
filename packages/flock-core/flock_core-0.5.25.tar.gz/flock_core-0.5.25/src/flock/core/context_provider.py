"""Context Provider - Security Boundary Layer.

The Context Provider is the CRITICAL SECURITY BOUNDARY between agents
(untrusted business logic) and the blackboard store (infrastructure).

SECURITY FIX (2025-10-16): This module implements the fix for three
critical security vulnerabilities:

- Vulnerability #1 (READ BYPASS): Agents could bypass visibility via ctx.board.list()
- Vulnerability #2 (WRITE BYPASS): Agents could bypass validation via ctx.board.publish()
- Vulnerability #3 (GOD MODE): Agents had unlimited ctx.orchestrator access

Solution: Context Provider enforces visibility filtering BEFORE agents see data.
Agents can NO LONGER bypass security because they don't have direct store access.
