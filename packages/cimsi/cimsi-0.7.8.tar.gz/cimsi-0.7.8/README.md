## Installation

IMSI is normally pre-installed on support machines by technical staff, and users need only source an environment.

You can install IMSI manually as shown below. It is recommended to install it inside a Python or Conda virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment 
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/activate
# conda create -n imsi-test python=3.10

git clone git@gitlab.science.gc.ca:CanESM/imsi.git
cd imsi
pip install .      # for usage
# pip install -e . # for development
```

## Basic usage
```bash
imsi -h # for help

# Setup a CanESM5.1 p1 CMIP6 piControl run
imsi setup --repo=https://gitlab.com/cccma/canesm --ver=develop_canesm --exp=cmip6-piControl --model=canesm51_p1 --runid=imsi-test
imsi build          # compile executables
imsi save-restarts  # save desired restarts
imsi submit         # submit the run
```
