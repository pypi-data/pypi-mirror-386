All notable changes to InjectQ will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Auto-registration of concrete types**: New `allow_concrete` parameter (default: True) 
  automatically registers concrete types when registering instances to base types
- **Registration override control**: New `allow_override` parameter (default: True) 
  controls whether existing service registrations can be overwritten
- Enhanced `bind_instance()` method with `allow_concrete` parameter
- Enhanced `bind_factory()` method with `allow_concrete` parameter
- Enhanced `bind()` method with `allow_concrete` parameter
- New `AlreadyRegisteredError` exception for override conflicts
- Comprehensive documentation with MkDocs
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Advanced middleware support
- Enhanced async support with context managers
- Resource management utilities
- Performance profiling tools
- Diagnostic and validation utilities
- Migration guides from other DI libraries

### Changed
- **Breaking**: InjectQ constructor now accepts `allow_override` parameter
- **Breaking**: All binding methods now accept `allow_concrete` parameter
- Dict-like syntax (`container[Type] = instance`) now uses `allow_concrete=True` by default
- Improved subclass injection support - both base and concrete types can be resolved
- Improved type safety and mypy compliance
- Enhanced error messages and debugging information
- Optimized performance for large dependency graphs

### Fixed
- Subclass injection issues where concrete types weren't accessible after registering to base type
- Various bug fixes and stability improvements

## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 Release Notes

InjectQ 0.1.0 is the first stable release of our modern Python dependency injection library. This release focuses on providing a simple yet powerful API that grows with your application needs.

#### Key Highlights

**ðŸŽ¯ Multiple API Styles**: Choose the injection style that fits your needs:
- Dict-like interface for simple cases
- `@inject` decorator for automatic injection
- `Inject()` function for explicit control

**ðŸ”’ Type Safety First**: Full mypy compliance with early error detection and comprehensive type checking.

**âš¡ Performance Optimized**: Compile-time dependency resolution with caching for minimal runtime overhead.

**ðŸ§ª Testing Built-in**: Comprehensive testing utilities including test containers, mocking, and async support.

**ðŸ”— Framework Native**: Built-in integrations for FastAPI, Taskiq, and FastMCP with idiomatic patterns.

#### Breaking Changes

None - this is the first stable release.

#### Migration Guide

This is the initial release, so no migration is needed. However, if you're coming from other dependency injection libraries, check out our [migration guides](migration/from-kink.md).
