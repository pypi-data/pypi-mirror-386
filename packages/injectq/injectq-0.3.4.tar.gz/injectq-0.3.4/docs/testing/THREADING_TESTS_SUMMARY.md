## Key Testing Scenarios Covered

### Race Condition Testing
- ✅ Singleton vs Transient scope behavior under concurrent access
- ✅ Concurrent binding and resolution operations
- ✅ Scope clearing while other threads are resolving
- ✅ Factory function calls under high contention

### Cross-Thread Injection
- ✅ Shared singleton instances across threads
- ✅ Thread-local state management
- ✅ Data storage and retrieval across threads
- ✅ Dependency modification across threads

### Thread Safety Components
- ✅ AsyncSafeCounter - Thread-safe counter with hybrid locking
- ✅ ThreadSafeDict - Thread-safe dictionary operations
- ✅ HybridLock - Works with both sync and async contexts
- ✅ Thread-safe container operations

### Error Handling
- ✅ Circular dependency detection in threaded environment
- ✅ Failed injection handling across threads
- ✅ Exception propagation in async contexts
- ✅ Memory cleanup and resource management

### Performance Testing
- ✅ Container performance under heavy concurrent load (2000+ operations)
- ✅ Lock contention and throughput testing
- ✅ Memory pressure testing
- ✅ Async operation scalability

### Async-Specific Testing
- ✅ Event loop integration
- ✅ Mixed sync/async contexts
- ✅ Concurrent coroutine execution
- ✅ Resource cleanup in async environments

## Test Architecture

### Service Classes Used
- **CounterService** - Basic service with thread ID tracking
- **ThreadSafeCounterService** - Thread-safe version with internal locking
- **DataService** - Service for key-value storage and retrieval
- **DependentService** - Service with dependencies for injection testing
- **AsyncDependentService** - Async service with async operations
- **FailingService** - Service that intentionally fails for error testing

### Testing Patterns
1. **Concurrent Execution** - Multiple threads/coroutines executing simultaneously
2. **Sequential Dependencies** - Operations that must happen in order
3. **Resource Contention** - Limited resources accessed by multiple threads
4. **State Sharing** - Shared state modification and verification
5. **Error Injection** - Intentional failures to test error handling

## Coverage Statistics

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:
- **Thread safety mechanisms** in InjectQ core
- **Race condition scenarios** in dependency injection
- **Cross-thread communication** patterns
- **Async/await integration** with threading
- **Performance characteristics** under load
- **Error handling** in concurrent environments

## Recommendations

1. **Fix the 9 failing tests** to achieve 100% test coverage
2. **Add more edge case scenarios** for corner cases
3. **Performance benchmarking** integration for regression testing
4. **Stress testing** with higher thread counts and longer durations
5. **Memory leak detection** with longer-running tests

This test suite serves as a robust foundation for ensuring InjectQ's thread safety and reliability in concurrent applications.
