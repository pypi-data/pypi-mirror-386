## Overview

Peak shaving is a strategy to reduce energy costs by minimizing peak demand utilizing energy storage systems. This project provides tools to optimize a given consumption time series with peak-shaving reducing capacity costs and visualizing results using Grafana.

## Features

- Peak shaving optimization using [FINE by FZJ](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/FINE)
- Easy configuration of many parameters
- Support for dynamic prices
- Inclusion of PV system integration with automatic retrieving of generation timeseries depending on location (with detection for leap years)
- Dockerized deployment with Grafana dashboards
- Example configurations for various scenarios

## Installation

You can install peakshaving-analyzer using pip. Choose the appropriate installation method based on your needs:

### Using pip

To install the core package:

```bash
pip install peakshaving-analyzer
```

### Timescale Database and Grafana Dashboards

If you want to benefit from a supported database and integrated Grafana dashboards for scenario analysis, you can use the provided Docker Compose file.

Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NOWUM/peakshaving-analyzer.git
cd peakshaving-analyzer
```

2. Start the database and Grafana using the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will launch a container for TimescaleDB and Grafana with preconfigured dashboards for analysis. You can access the Grafana dashboards at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

You can use Peak Shaving Analyzer flexibly â€“ either with a YAML configuration file, directly from Python code or use the [OpenEnergyDataServer](https://github.com/open-energy-data-server/open-energy-data-server). Results can be saved locally as files or in a database.

### Using the CLI

Use `psa -h` to see the usage of the CLI tool and it's options.

### Loading the Configuration

**1. Load from YAML configuration file:**
```python
from peakshaving_analyzer import PeakShavingAnalyzer, load_yaml_config

config = load_yaml_config("/path/to/your/config.yml")
```

**2. Load from OEDS:**
```python
from peakshaving_analyzer import PeakShavingAnalyzer, load_oeds_config

config = load_oeds_config(load_oeds_config(con="your/database/uri", profile_id=id_to_analyze))
```

**3. Load from a Python dictionary:**

Please note that a lot of configuration is done by the loaders, so it's best to use one of the provided loaders.
```python
from peakshaving_analyzer import PeakShavingAnalyzer, Config

config_dict = {
    "name": "MyScenario",
    "consumption_timeseries": [...],
    # further parameters
}
config = Config(config_dict)
```

### Initialize the Peakshaving Analyzer and run it:

Running the `optimize()` method will return a `Results` object.
```python
psa = PeakShavingAnalyzer(config=config)
results = psa.optimize(solver="your_prefered_solver")
```

### Saving Results

Results objects can be printed to std-out, written to file (.csv, .yaml, .json) or converted to python objects.

**1. Save as file (e.g. CSV, YAML, ...):**
```python
results = psa.optimize()
results.to_csv("results.csv")
results.to_json("results.json")
results.to_yaml("results.yaml")
```

For saving the timeseries, please use the following functions:
```python
results = psa.optimize()
results.timeseries_to_csv("timeseries.csv")
results.timeseries_to_json("timeseries.json")
```


**2. Save to database (TimescaleDB):**
If you use the Docker environment, results are automatically written to TimescaleDB. You can also trigger saving explicitly:
```python
results = psa.optimize()
results.to_sql(connection="your/database/uri")
```

**3. Use as Python object:**

After optimization, results are available as a Python object for further processing:
```python
results = psa.optimize()
# Access individual values
print(results.total_yearly_costs_eur)

# print everything
results.print()

# convert to dict or dataframe
results_dict = results.to_dict()
results_dataframe = results.to_dataframe()
```

**4. Plot the resulting timeseries:**

The resulting timeseries (storage charging / discharging, state of charge, PV generation, grid usage, ...) can be easily plotted:

```python
results = psa.optimize()
results.plot_timeseries()
results.plot_consumption_timeseries()
results.plot_storage_timeseries()
```

For more details on configuration, see the example files in the `examples` directory.

## Examples

In the `examples` directory are four examples:
* A scenario examining only a storage system using hourly values with a fixed, non-dynamic price for the used energy.
* A scenario examining only a storage system using quarterhouly values with a fixed, non-dynamic price for the used energy.
* A scenario examining only a storage system using quarterhourly values with a dynamic, time-depended price for the used energy.
* A scenario examining a storage system as well as a photovoltaic system using hourly values with a dynamic, time-depended price for the used energy.

You can run these examples with `python3 ./examples/example/main.py` from the base directory.
