# Git Atoms Index

These atoms provide **read-focused, quantitative signals** about the repo,
keeping write operations **opt-in and guarded**.

**Read-only**
- [status.md](status.md) — working tree status (porcelain-like)
- [diff_unstaged.md](diff_unstaged.md) — diff of unstaged changes
- [diff_staged.md](diff_staged.md) — diff of staged changes
- [log.md](log.md) — recent commit log (structured)
- [sweep.md](sweep.md) — combined snapshot: status + diffs + log (for grounding)

**Safe helpers (mutating)**
- [stage.md](stage.md) — add specific files to index (requires `auto_confirm`)
- [reset.md](reset.md) — unstage all changes (requires `auto_confirm`)
- [commit.md](commit.md) — create commit (requires `allow_dangerous: true`)

**Notes**
- Prefer calling these from hooks/workflows that ALSO consult `workflows/policies/`.
- `commit.md` is intentionally strict; most high-level workflows should still centralize commits elsewhere.
