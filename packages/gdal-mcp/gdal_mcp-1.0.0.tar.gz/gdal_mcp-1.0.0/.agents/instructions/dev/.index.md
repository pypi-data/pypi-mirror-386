# Dev Module (.windsurf/workflows/dev)

**Purpose**
A small, configurable development loop that enhances a prompted task with quality gates. It is intentionally VCS‑free. Use hooks or other workflows to stage/commit/push.

## Files

- `quality.md` — Resolves tool commands from the environment (Poetry‑preferred, CLI fallback) and runs the selected gates:
  - format (e.g., black, isort)
  - lint (e.g., ruff, flake8)
  - typecheck (e.g., mypy)
  - tests (pytest with env‑default args)
  - Each gate can be toggled via `run_*` inputs; empty overrides skip a gate.

- `loop.md` — The core development loop:
  - Accepts a human **task** and a **scope**
  - Calls `quality.md` with switches/overrides
  - Emits a concise summary for downstream steps
  - **No VCS or ConPort side‑effects**

## Typical Consumption

From a higher‑level workflow (e.g., `continue.md`), after preflight:

```yaml
- id: dev
  action: Read the contents of the file.
  file: .windsurf/workflows/dev/loop.md
  with:
    task: "{{ inputs.task }}"
    scope: "{{ inputs.scope or '.' }}"
    run_format: "{{ inputs.quality_gate.format }}"
    run_lint:   "{{ inputs.quality_gate.lint }}"
    run_types:  "{{ inputs.quality_gate.typecheck }}"
    run_tests:  "{{ inputs.quality_gate.tests }}"
    # Optionally pass explicit commands to override auto-resolved tooling:
    # fmt_cmds:  ["poetry run black {{ inputs.scope }}", "poetry run isort {{ inputs.scope }}"]
    # lint_cmds: ["poetry run ruff check --fix --select I {{ inputs.scope }}"]
    # types_cmds:["poetry run mypy {{ inputs.scope }}"]
    # tests_cmd: "poetry run pytest -q"
