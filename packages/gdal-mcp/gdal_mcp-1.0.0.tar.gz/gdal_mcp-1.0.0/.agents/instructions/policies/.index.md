# .index.md (Policies)

**Purpose**
This index acts as the **single entrypoint** for all policies in this directory. Any workflow, hook, or agent should consume *this file first* to discover and apply all active policies.

---

## Active Policies
* [role.md](role.md) — Senior Engineer Task Execution Rule
* [always.md](always.md) — Standing positive instructions (baseline behavior, logging, library preference).
* [never.md](never.md) — Guardrails and prohibitions (things that must not be done without explicit override).

---

## Consumption Rules

* **Agents**:

  * Read and internalize all linked policies *fully* before executing any workflow.
  * Apply these policies continuously during execution.
  * If a conflict arises, assume `never.md` overrides `always.md` (safety > convenience).

* **Hooks (pre/post)**:

  * Include this index file as the **single point of reference**.
  * Do not reference individual policy files directly.
  * Record any policy violations or waivers in ConPort logs for traceability.

* **Future Policies**:

  * New files (e.g., `teaching.md`, `security.md`) must be added here to become active.
  * Policy files not listed here are considered inactive.

---

## Notes

* This file ensures stability: workflow definitions never need to change when policies are added or updated.
* Policies here define **behavior and personality**, not task-level operations (those belong in hooks and building blocks).
