# GDAL MCP

**The first geospatial AI substrate with epistemic reasoning**

> *"Before reprojecting to EPSG:3857, why is this CRS appropriate for your analysis? What spatial properties must be preserved? What distortion tradeoffs are acceptable?"*

GDAL MCP doesn't just execute geospatial operations‚Äîit **thinks through them**. Built on FastMCP with a reflection middleware that requires AI agents to justify methodological decisions before execution.

**üéâ v1.0.0 Released (2025-10-24)** ‚Äî First MCP server with built-in epistemic governance  
**üß† Reflection System** ‚Äî Pre-execution reasoning for CRS, resampling, hydrology, and aggregation

## üß† Why Reflection Matters

**Geospatial operations have consequences.** Choosing the wrong resampling method can introduce false elevation data. Selecting an inappropriate CRS can distort area calculations by 40%. Aggregating without understanding data distribution can hide critical outliers.

**Traditional approach:**
```
User: "Reproject this DEM to Web Mercator"
AI: *immediately executes gdal.Warp()*
```

**GDAL MCP with reflection:**
```
User: "Reproject this DEM to Web Mercator for a web map"
AI: *triggered to justify CRS choice*
    "Before reprojecting to EPSG:3857:
     - Intent: Preserve angular relationships for web tile rendering
     - Alternatives considered: EPSG:4326 (rejected: not conformal)
     - Tradeoffs: Distance/area distortion at high latitudes acceptable for visualization
     - Confidence: High"
*stores justification, proceeds with operation*
```

The AI doesn't just follow instructions‚Äîit **understands the methodology**.

## üéØ Real-World Examples

### Example 1: DEM Reprojection with Methodological Reasoning

**Scenario:** You need to reproject a 30m elevation model from WGS84 to UTM for slope analysis.

**User prompt:**
```
Reproject my DEM from test/data/elevation.tif to UTM Zone 10N. 
I need accurate slope calculations.
```

**What happens:**

1. **AI inspects the source:** `raster_info` reveals EPSG:4326, 30m resolution
2. **Reflection triggered (CRS):**
   - Why UTM Zone 10N (EPSG:32610)?
   - Intent: Preserve distance accuracy for slope/aspect calculations
   - Alternative: Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) ‚Äî rejected, non-conformal distortion
   - Tradeoff: Limited to ~6¬∞ longitude zone, acceptable for local analysis
3. **Reflection triggered (Resampling):**
   - Why cubic convolution?
   - Intent: Smooth gradients while preserving elevation values
   - Alternative: Nearest neighbor ‚Äî rejected, creates blocky artifacts in slope
   - Alternative: Bilinear ‚Äî rejected, cubic provides superior smoothness for derivatives
4. **Execution:** Reprojection proceeds with cached justifications
5. **Result:** Properly reprojected DEM with documented methodology

**Cache behavior:** Next time you reproject *any* DEM to UTM with cubic, no re-justification needed.

### Example 2: Multi-Resolution COG Creation

**User prompt:**
```
Create a Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF from this 10GB Landsat scene.
Optimize for web serving with multiple zoom levels.
```

**What happens:**

1. **AI plans the operation:** Convert with compression + overviews
2. **Smart defaults applied:**
   - Driver: COG (Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF)
   - Compression: DEFLATE (lossless, good ratio)
   - Tiling: 256√ó256 blocks (web-optimized)
   - Overviews: [2, 4, 8, 16] (zoom levels)
3. **Execution with real-time feedback:**
   ```
   Building overviews [2, 4, 8, 16]...
   Output: 1.2GB (88% reduction)
   Validation: ‚úì COG structure valid
   ```

### Example 3: Cache Intelligence

**First request:**
```
Reproject this imagery to EPSG:3857 using cubic resampling for a web map.
```
‚Üí Triggers both CRS and resampling justifications (~30 seconds)

**Second request (same session):**
```
Now reproject this other tile to EPSG:3857 with cubic for the same map.
```
‚Üí Cache hit! Both justifications reused (instant)

**Third request (different parameter):**
```
Actually, use bilinear instead to reduce processing time.
```
‚Üí CRS justification cached, only resampling re-justified

## ‚ö° Key Features

### üß† Reflection System (v1.0.0)

**The core innovation:** FastMCP middleware that intercepts tool calls and enforces epistemic discipline.

- **Pre-execution reasoning prompts** for operations with methodological implications
- **Structured justifications** (intent ‚Üí alternatives ‚Üí choice ‚Üí tradeoffs ‚Üí confidence)
- **Persistent cache** (`.preflight/justifications/{domain}/`) with SHA256-based lookup
- **Domain-specific reasoning:** CRS/datum, resampling, hydrology conditioning, aggregation
- **Automatic cache hits:** Same parameters = instant execution (no re-justification)

**Reflection domains:**
- `crs_datum` ‚Äî Coordinate system selection and datum transformations
- `resampling` ‚Äî Interpolation method choice for raster operations  
- `hydrology` ‚Äî Flow direction, watershed delineation, DEM conditioning *(planned)*
- `aggregation` ‚Äî Zonal statistics, temporal composites, data fusion *(planned)*

**How it works:**
1. User requests operation with methodological choices (e.g., "reproject to UTM")
2. Middleware intercepts `raster_reproject` call, checks cache
3. If no justification exists ‚Üí triggers `justify_crs_selection` prompt
4. AI provides structured reasoning ‚Üí stored with hash key
5. Operation proceeds with validated methodology
6. Future requests with same parameters skip justification (cache hit)
