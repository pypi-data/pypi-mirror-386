# GDAL MCP Vision

**Status**: Living Document  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-07  
**Purpose**: Define the long-term vision and guiding principles for gdal-mcp development

---

## Executive Summary

**gdal-mcp is not a drop-in replacement for GDAL commands.**

It is a foundation for **agentic geospatial reasoning** - enabling AI agents to understand spatial problems, compose analytical workflows, and bridge the gap between domain expertise and technical implementation.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### The Current Reality

Geospatial analysis requires two forms of expertise that rarely coexist in one person:

1. **Domain Knowledge**: Understanding terrain, hydrology, ecology, geology, urban planning, etc.
2. **Technical Implementation**: GDAL syntax, projection systems, algorithm parameters, data formats, etc.

**This creates barriers:**

- A 30-year veteran hydrologist who deeply understands watersheds cannot perform basic slope analysis because they don't know GDAL syntax
- A GIS analyst spends hours on Stack Overflow translating "what I want to do" into "the exact command to do it"
- Domain experts are blocked by technical complexity, not lack of understanding
- Knowledge remains siloed: experts can't operationalize their insights without developers

### Why This Matters

**Geospatial expertise is being wasted.** People who understand the science cannot apply their knowledge because the tools require a different kind of expertise entirely.

---

## The Vision

### What Success Looks Like

**In 5 years, a domain expert should be able to:**

> "Show me all areas where slope exceeds 30 degrees within 500 meters of perennial streams, excluding urban zones, and calculate the erosion risk for each parcel."

**And receive:**
- A complete analysis workflow executed correctly
- Results with spatial context
- Explanation of methodology
- Ability to refine and iterate in natural language

**No GDAL commands. No Python scripts. No Stack Overflow.**

Just domain expertise expressed in domain language, translated to precise geospatial operations by an AI agent that understands both.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Agentic Reasoning Over Command Translation

**Not This:**
```
User: "Reproject to Web Mercator"
AI: Executes gdalwarp with EPSG:3857
```

**This:**
```
User: "I need to display this elevation model in a web map"
AI: Reasons about requirements
    → Web display needs Web Mercator
    → Elevation models need appropriate resampling
    → Executes reprojection with cubic resampling
    → Suggests COG format for web performance
    → Explains why these choices were made
```

**The AI should understand *why*, not just *what*.**

### 2. Multi-Step Workflow Composition

**Not This:**
- Single tool calls in isolation
- User manually chains operations
- No context between steps

**This:**
- AI plans entire workflows
- Understands data flow between steps
- Optimizes processing order
- Handles intermediate results
- Adapts based on data characteristics

**Example:**
```
User: "Identify potential landslide zones in this region"

AI Reasoning:
1. Understand requirement: slope analysis + hydrology
2. Check available data: DEM, stream network, soil maps
3. Plan workflow:
   - Extract slope from DEM
   - Identify steep areas (>30°)
   - Calculate distance to streams
   - Overlay with soil permeability
   - Combine factors into risk score
4. Execute pipeline
5. Return spatially-indexed results
6. Explain methodology and assumptions
```

### 3. Domain Language, Not Technical Syntax

**Domain experts speak in:**
- Watersheds, not polygons
- Slope, not derivatives
- Riparian zones, not buffers
- Erosion potential, not algorithms

**The AI must:**
- Understand domain terminology
- Translate to technical operations
- Preserve semantic intent
- Explain in domain terms

### 4. Accessibility Without Compromise

**Target Users:**
- Hydrologists who understand watersheds but not programming
- Ecologists who understand habitat but not GIS
- Geologists who understand terrain but not GDAL
- Urban planners who understand zoning but not spatial analysis
- Field researchers who collect data but can't process it

**These users have:**
- Deep domain expertise (decades)
- Limited technical background
- Real analytical needs
- No time to learn GDAL

**They should not be limited by technical barriers.**

## Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current - v0.x)

- Raster analysis (slope, aspect, hillshade, viewshed)
- Format conversions (comprehensive)
- Multi-band operations
- Metadata management

**Focus**: Building the toolkit AI agents can compose

### Phase 3: Workflow Intelligence (v1.x - v2.0)

**Goal**: Enable multi-step reasoning and composition

- Workflow planning capabilities

## Design Implications

### What This Vision Means for Development

1. **Tool Design**
   - Tools must be composable (output → input chains)
   - Metadata must flow through pipelines
   - Context must be preservable
   - Operations must be explainable

2. **API Design**
   - Expose capabilities, not commands
   - Support workflow description
   - Enable reasoning about data characteristics
   - Provide semantic context

3. **Architecture**
   - Plan for stateful workflows
   - Support async long-running operations
   - Enable intermediate result inspection
   - Facilitate context sharing

4. **Documentation**
   - Emphasize *when* and *why*, not just *how*
   - Provide domain-oriented examples
   - Explain spatial concepts
   - Guide AI reasoning

## Success Metrics

**We know we're succeeding when:**

1. **Domain experts can work independently**
   - Hydrologist analyzes watersheds without GIS staff
   - Ecologist maps habitat without developers
   - Geologist models terrain without Stack Overflow

2. **Complex analyses become conversations**
   - Multi-step workflows described in sentences
   - Iterative refinement through dialogue
   - No manual scripting required

3. **Quality increases**
   - AI chooses appropriate methods
   - Spatial relationships preserved
   - Results are reproducible
   - Methodology is documented

4. **Knowledge is captured**
   - Expert workflows become templates
   - Best practices encoded
   - Institutional knowledge preserved

## What This Is Not

### We Are Not Building:

❌ **QGIS in chat form** - We're enabling reasoning, not replicating GUIs  
❌ **GDAL command generator** - We're composing workflows, not translating syntax  
❌ **Black-box magic** - We're making expertise accessible, not hiding complexity  
❌ **Replacement for domain knowledge** - We're amplifying expertise, not replacing it

### We Are Building:

✅ **A bridge** between domain expertise and technical implementation  
✅ **An amplifier** for geospatial knowledge that's currently trapped  
✅ **A foundation** for AI that understands spatial reasoning  
✅ **A democratizer** making powerful analysis accessible to experts

## Guiding Questions for Development

When evaluating features, ask:

1. **Does this enable reasoning or just execution?**
   - Good: "AI can understand why this operation is needed"
   - Bad: "AI can execute this command faster"

2. **Does this help domain experts or technical users?**
   - Good: "A hydrologist can express this in domain terms"
   - Bad: "A developer can write this command easier"

3. **Does this compose or isolate?**
   - Good: "This tool connects to other operations naturally"
   - Bad: "This tool only works in isolation"

4. **Does this explain or obscure?**
   - Good: "Users understand what happened and why"
   - Bad: "It works but users don't know how"

---

## Call to Action

**This vision will take years to realize.** It requires:

- Incremental, thoughtful development
- Partnership with domain experts
- Commitment to accessibility
- Patience with complexity
- Community collaboration

**But the destination is worth it:**

A world where geospatial expertise is no longer limited by technical barriers. Where hydrologists can analyze watersheds, ecologists can map habitats, and geologists can model terrain - all through natural conversation with AI that understands their domain.

**That's the vision. That's what we're building.**
