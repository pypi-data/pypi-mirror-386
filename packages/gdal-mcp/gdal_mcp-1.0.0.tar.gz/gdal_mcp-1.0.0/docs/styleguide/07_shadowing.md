# Shadowing

### Principle
Avoid name collisions between locals and imports.

### ‚úÖ Prefer
```python
import config

def run(cfg: Config):
    ...
````

### Also Fine

Prefix locals with `_` or rename (`config_`, `cfg`).

### ü§ù Our Philosophy

Avoid clever naming collisions.
Choose clarity every time.
