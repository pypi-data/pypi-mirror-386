# SOLID Principles (Lightweight)

### Principle
Follow the spirit of SOLID for maintainability.

**S** — Single Responsibility  
**O** — Open for extension, closed for modification  
**L** — Subtypes respect contracts  
**I** — Keep interfaces focused  
**D** — Depend on abstractions, not implementations

### Smells
- “God files” or `utils.py`
- Functions that do too many unrelated tasks
- Tight coupling between layers

### 🤝 Our Philosophy
These are ideals, not laws.  
We aim for clarity, not theoretical perfection.
