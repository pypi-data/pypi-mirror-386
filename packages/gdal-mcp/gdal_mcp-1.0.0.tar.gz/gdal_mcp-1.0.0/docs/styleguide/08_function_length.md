# Function Length

### Guideline
Keep functions around **20 lines or fewer**.  
Extract helpers when they grow complex.

### ‚úÖ Prefer
Small, well-named helpers with one purpose.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Soft Limit
Longer is okay if it reads cleanly and remains cohesive.  
Use judgment, not word count.

---

### ü§ù Our Philosophy
Functions should read like clear thoughts: short enough to hold in your head.
