# ü™∂ Our Python Styleguide

This styleguide exists to **make life easier, not harder.**

It captures the patterns that keep our codebase consistent, readable, and friendly for both humans and tools.  
These are *preferences*, not commandments.

We value:
- üß≠ **Clarity over cleverness**
- üîÑ **Consistency over purity**
- üí¨ **Empathy over elitism**

If your code is clear, maintainable, and works: you‚Äôre doing it right.

> üí° Use these as reference points when you‚Äôre unsure how to format something.
> We won‚Äôt nitpick or gatekeep style. Our goal is harmony, not homogeneity.

### ü§ù Our Philosophy

We share these guidelines to make collaboration smoother, not to judge anyone‚Äôs intelligence or experience.  
Every contributor brings their own style and background.  

These docs simply provide a **common baseline** so our collective work feels coherent and approachable.
