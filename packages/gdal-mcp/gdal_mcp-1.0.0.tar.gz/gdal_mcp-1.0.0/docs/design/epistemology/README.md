*Geospatial Agentic Governance Manifesto (v1)*

> **Epistemology** — the discipline concerned with *when* and *why* knowledge is justified,  
> not merely *how* it is produced.


## 1. The Problem This Solves

Modern LLMs already understand *how* to perform geospatial operations, but without epistemic grounding they cannot justify *why* a particular method is scientifically appropriate.
Without this justification layer, tool use collapses into *automation without methodology* — a sophisticated wrapper around GDAL rather than a scientifically competent agent.

In geospatial analysis, **the wrong method that “works” is often worse than no method at all**, because it silently produces invalid science.

This document defines *how* the agent should reason about *correctness*, not just execution.

## 2. Why Rules Are Insufficient (and Become Worse Over Time)

Rules attempt to *constrain* behavior.
But as models improve, the bottleneck is no longer *capability* — it is *justification*.

Hard rules:

* rot as edge cases grow,
* suppress emerging strategies,
* freeze historical methodology,
* and eventually conflict with better reasoning.

In future models, rule-based governance will be *strictly regressive*.

Epistemic governance, by contrast, **expands as models improve**.

---

## 3. What Epistemic Governance Is

Epistemology in an agentic context means:

> The conditions under which the model must **elevate its reasoning from “procedure” to “methodology.”**

It does not tell the model *what* to think;
it governs *when the model must stop and verify its own reasoning* against scientific ground truth.

This shift reframes GDAL-MCP:
- ❌ not an “execution wrapper”
- ✅ a *methodological conscience*

## 4. Division of Cognitive Responsibility

| Responsibility               | Holder                     | Why                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Conceptual understanding     | The agent                  | Modern models already know GIS concepts          |
| Procedural capability        | The agent                  | Reasoning is native; tool calls are an extension |
| Methodological justification | The **agent** (not system) | Scientific validity must be owned by cognition   |
| Grounding / evidence         | The MCP                    | Provides the substrate for epistemic checking    |

MCP serves evidence.
The agent serves judgment.

## 5. When Epistemic Escalation Must Occur

Escalation to methodology (domain reflective reasoning) must occur when **either** of:

1. **Uncertainty Trigger**
   The model is unsure whether its chosen approach will preserve scientific validity.

2. **Scientific Risk Trigger**
   The type of operation is one where correctness depends on *method*, not just syntax (e.g. reprojection, resampling, watershed conditioning, datum choice, etc.)

Escalation is *not punishment*.
It is *awareness of epistemic stakes*.

---

## 6. Methodology as Scaffolding, Not Constraint

Methodology prompts provide **supportive scaffolds** the agent may step into as needed.
They exist to **elevate reasoning**, not **replace** it.

The system never preloads a workflow.
The agent *chooses* when to consult methodology — preserving *agency and emergence*.

The goal is not “follow a recipe.”
The goal is “demonstrate a reason.”

---

## 7. Forward-Compatibility With Stronger Models

As models grow, methodological reflection becomes *less about teaching* and *more about auditing*.

Today:
“Have you chosen the appropriate method?”

Future:
“Have you discovered a better method than the textbook canon?”

This manifesto exists so that future cognition is **not constrained by the past**,
but **continues to justify itself in scientifically defensible ways.**

---

## 8. Core Commitments (Declarative)

The epistemic contract of this project:

1. The agent holds epistemic responsibility for *why*, not just *what*.
2. MCPs supply grounding, not constraint.
3. Escalation is triggered by *uncertainty OR scientific risk*.
4. Methodology is invoked on-demand, never soaked globally.
5. Reasoning must remain open-ended to support future discoveries.
6. Correctness derives from justification, not repetition.
7. Tools assist cognition — cognition does not defer to tools.

---

## 9. A Living Epistemology

This is a *first articulation* of a governance layer that scientific agents require — a layer that is neither mere prompting nor procedural rule-setting.

It is intentionally open, because epistemic practice in agentic systems is still an *unfolding field*.

We expect this document to evolve as models evolve, and as the community deepens its understanding of what “scientific correctness” means for systems capable of *independent methodological reasoning.*
