# wink-sdk-extranet-property-register
 # Introduction
 Welcome to the Wink API - A programmer-friendly way to manage, sell and book travel inventory on the Wink platform. The API gives you all the tools you need to ready your properties and inventory for sale across 1000s of our native sales channels.
 Integrators, affiliates, travel agents and content creators have the ability search for your travel inventory and promote / sell it in a wide variety of ways.

 # Integrations
 We have already integrated with the most well-known channel managers so you don't have to. To see our current integrations, please go to https://extranet.wink.travel and scroll to Connectivity section. Once your properties are set up, you can finish the setup by mapping your property to Wink using your channel manager partner portal. If your properties don't have a channel manager, you can easily manage rates and availability with this API.

 # Intended Audience
 Programmers are [most likely] a requirement to start integrating with Wink. Companies and organizations that would most benefit from integrating with us are new and existing travel companies that have relationships with suppliers and that need an advanced system from which to manage their travel inventory and get that same inventory out to as many eyeballs as possible at the lowest price possible.
 - Hotel chains
 - Hotel brands
 - Travel tech companies
 - Destination sites
 - Integrators
 - Aggregators
 - Destination management companies
 - Travel agencies
 - OTAs

 ## SDKs
 We are actively working on supporting the most used languages out there. If you don't see your language here, reach out to us with a request to officially add your language. In the meantime, if you want to roll your own SDK, you can do so by downloading the OpenAPI spec and using one of the many available OpenAPI generators available: [https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators).

 - Java SDK [https://github.com/wink-travel/wink-sdk-java](https://github.com/wink-travel/wink-sdk-java)

 ## Usage
 These features are made available to you via a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). This API is language agnostic.

 ## Versioning
 We chose to version our endpoints in a way that we hope affects your integration minimally. You request the version of our API you wish to work with via the `Wink-Version` header. When it's time for you to upgrade, you only have to change the version number to get access to our updated endpoints.

 ## Release history
 - Follow updates on Github: https://github.com/wink-travel/wink-sdk-java/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md



# Extranet Property Registration API
This part of the documentation concerns itself about adding new properties to Wink. There are two endpoints for you to onboard a property:

1. Manage leads
2. Manually: Use this endpoint if you already have all the property data. Use case: You want to migrate your existing properties to Wink.
3. Intelligently: With the assistance of Google Business Pages, you can select an existing property on Google, ingest it with the lead endpoint and let us create a Wink property for you. Note: This isn't always straightforward in places with non-standard addresses.

Browse the endpoints in the left navigation bar to get started.
