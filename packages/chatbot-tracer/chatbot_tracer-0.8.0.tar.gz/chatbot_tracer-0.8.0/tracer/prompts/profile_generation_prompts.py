You are a User Profile Designer for chatbot testing. Your task is to group the following chatbot functionalities into a MINIMAL number of LOGICAL user profiles.
The primary goal is to ensure ALL functionalities are covered for testing across the generated profiles, using as FEW profiles as reasonably possible.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS (Apply to ALL profiles):
- Create ONLY profiles for realistic end users with PRACTICAL GOALS.
- NEVER create profiles about users asking about chatbot capabilities or limitations.
- NEVER create profiles where the user is trying to test or evaluate the chatbot.
- Focus ONLY on real-world user tasks and objectives.
- Profiles should be genuine use cases, not meta-conversations about the chatbot itself.

AVAILABLE CHATBOT FUNCTIONALITIES ({num_functionalities} total, including input/output details):
{functionality_list_str}
{context_str}
**Instructions for Grouping:**

1.  **Analyze Relationships & Workflow:** Examine the functionalities. Identify functionalities that are intrinsically related, often used together, or form a sequence in a user journey. The WORKFLOW INFORMATION (if provided) is CRITICAL for grouping sequential transactional steps.
2.  **Define Coherent Roles/Personas:** For each group of functionalities, define a user role/persona that would naturally use them together (e.g., "Prospective Student Inquiring about Admissions," "Customer Placing a Standard Order," "User Troubleshooting an Issue").
{grouping_strategy_instruction}
3.  **Logical Grouping for Coverage & Efficiency:** Assign functionalities to profiles to ensure:
    *   **Complete Coverage:** Every functionality from the input list MUST be assigned to at least one profile.
    *   **Logical Cohesion:** Functionalities within a profile should make sense for the defined role to perform in a related series of interactions.
    *   **Efficiency:** Aim for the minimum number of profiles needed to cover all functionalities logically. A profile can and often should cover multiple related functionalities. Avoid creating profiles for single, isolated functionalities if they can be logically grouped.
4.  **Describe the Role:** For each profile, provide a concise description of the user's role or primary objective.
5.  **Output Format:** Structure your response exactly as follows:

## PROFILE: [Profile Name (e.g., New Item Order and Customization)]
ROLE: [Description of the user role/objective for this profile]
FUNCTIONALITIES:
- [Full functionality description string as provided in input, assigned to this profile]
- [Another full functionality description string assigned to this profile]
...

{context["language_instruction_grouping"]}
Make sure profile names and roles are descriptive. Ensure ALL input functionalities are assigned. The goal is to create the SMALLEST number of profiles that logically cover all functionalities.

**Goal Generation Instructions:**

1.  **Create 2-5 User-Centric Goals:** Goals must reflect what a real user wants to *achieve*.
2.  **Sequential & Coherent:** If testing a TRANSACTIONAL chatbot or a known workflow, goals should form a logical sequence of steps a user would take. Use the WORKFLOW INFORMATION and PARAMETER DETAILS.
3.  **Test Parameters with `{{variables}}`:** For functionalities with parameters (see PARAMETER DETAILS), formulate goals that naturally incorporate providing values for these parameters using their **exact names** as `{{parameter_name}}` placeholders.
4.  **Utilize Outputs as Inputs (Parameter Chaining):**
    Refer to "CONTEXTUAL KNOWLEDGE - CHATBOT CAN PROVIDE THESE LISTS OF CHOICES".
    If a functionality assigned to this profile *requires an input* that matches one of those listed choice categories (e.g., profile needs to test `select_item_type`, and you know `list_item_types` outputs "item_type_choices: TypeA, TypeB"), then:
    a. Create a goal to first *elicit* that list of choices from the chatbot (e.g., "Ask what item types are available.").
    b. Create a subsequent goal to *use one of those choices* (e.g., "Select the item type {{chosen_item_type}}.").
    The `{{chosen_item_type}}` variable will later be defined to iterate through TypeA, TypeB, etc.
5.  **Cover Assigned Functionalities:** The set of goals should aim to trigger the "TARGET FUNCTIONALITIES FOR THIS PROFILE".
6.  **Realistic & Practical:** Goals must be tasks a real user would perform.
7.  **Variable Placeholder Format:** Strictly use `{{variable_name}}`.
8.  **AVOID:**
    *   Goals about testing the chatbot, its limitations, or general knowledge.
    *   Meta-goals like "see what happens if I provide X."
    *   Goals that are too vague or too complex for a single user turn.

**Output Format:**

GOALS:
- "First user goal, possibly using {{variable_for_param1}}."
- "Second user goal, perhaps asking for choices, like 'What {{item_category_options}} are available?'"
- "Third goal, using a choice like 'Select the {{chosen_item_from_category}}'."

Generate ONLY the goals.
