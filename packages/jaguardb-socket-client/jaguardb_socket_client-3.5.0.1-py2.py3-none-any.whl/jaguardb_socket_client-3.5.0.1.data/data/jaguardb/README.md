# Jaguar Vector Database socket client programs

In the "JaguarDB Socket Client" package, you will discover a collection of programs designed to cater to diverse
client needs when interacting with the Jaguar server. This package offers a mode of operation: direct communication
with the Jaguar server through TCP/IP sockets for tasks such as data storage and querying.

Direct Communication with Jaguar Server: Clients have the option to establish a direct connection with the Jaguar
server. This allows for efficient data storage and retrieval, as well as streamlined queries, offering a robust
and platform-independent solution. 

The package requires and depends on shipped libJaguarClient.so and jaguarpy.so for Ubuntu 22.04 platforms.
