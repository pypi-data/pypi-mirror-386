# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-23
### Enhanced
- **Performance Optimizations**: Major parallelization improvements using joblib
  - Parallelized Moran's I computation in `filter_variant_moransI` with batch processing
  - Parallelized mutation enrichment computation in `MiToTreeAnnotator.get_M` method
  - Memory-efficient matrix caching to avoid redundant serialization across workers
  - Configurable core usage and temporary folder management for large datasets

### Added
- **Multi-allelic Site Filtering**: New quality control functionality
  - Added `filter_multiallelic_sites` function to remove variants from sites with multiple alleles
  - Integrated multi-allelic filtering in RedeeM data processing pipeline
  - Ensures each genomic position has only one variant type for cleaner analyses
- **Dual Implementation Support**: Both serial and parallel versions available for performance testing
- **Enhanced RedeeM Support**: Improved data processing for RedeeM scLT system

### Fixed
- Memory usage optimization in parallel processing by caching matrix variables
- Proper joblib backend configuration for stable parallel execution
- Improved progress tracking for long-running computations

### Technical
- Migrated from multiprocessing to joblib for better memory management
- Added batch processing patterns for scalable parallel computation
- Enhanced error handling and progress reporting in parallel workflows

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-08
### Enhanced
- Improved clonal inference algorithm with edge case handling for small phylogenies
- Added `af_treshold` parameter to `resolve_ambiguous_clones` for better clone merging control
- Split `infer_clones` and `resolve_ambiguous_clones` methods for better modularity
- Enhanced grid search optimization with better parameter handling
- Fixed root node exclusion in `_find_clones` to prevent single-clone edge cases

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where very small phylogenies would only return root as single clone
- Improved silhouette score calculation for edge cases with minimal clones
- Better parameter validation and error handling in clonal inference pipeline

### Refactored
- Cleaner separation between clone detection and clone resolution phases
- Improved code organization in `MiToTreeAnnotator` class
- Better debugging support with modular function structure

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-06
### Added
- Complete documentation overhaul with nbsphinx integration
- Interactive Jupyter notebook tutorial with full cell outputs and visualizations
- Comprehensive getting started guide with MiTo workflow examples

- ReadTheDocs integration with automated builds

### Improved
- Streamlined installation guide with clear step-by-step instructions
- Enhanced plotting library examples and demonstrations
- Better code organization and documentation structure
- Cleaner repository structure with proper .gitignore rules

### Fixed
- nbsphinx configuration for proper notebook rendering
- Image generation and display in documentation
- Documentation build process for ReadTheDocs compatibility
- File size issues with test data exclusion
