def avg_spectro(x, stride, fftlength=None, overlap=None, t0=None, fs=None, window='blackman', average='mean', **psdkwgs):

    Function to compute the averaged spectrogram of a time series ``x``. This is based on `scipy.signal.spectrogram <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.spectrogram.html>`_ function, with the key parameters redefined in units of seconds instead of points. This function computes consecutive Fourier transforms of the data. The result is then averaged (approximately) every ``stride`` seconds, according to the selected ``average`` method (classical choices are ``'mean'`` and ``'median'``). Notice that, depending on the choice of ``fftlength``, ``overlap``, and the original sampling frequency of the data ``fs``, the output has only approximatively a spacing of ``stride`` seconds.  This is done to avoid data loss, when the number of points in each non-overlapping FFT is not a sub-multiple of the point included in every stride. If you prefer to have exactly ``stride`` seconds spaced estimates, with consequent data loss, make use of the other ``multi_spectro`` method.
    
    Parameters

    x : array_like

    t0 : float, optional
        Epoch where to start the returned time vector
    fs : int, optional

    average : str, optional
        Typical choices are ``'mean'`` or ``'median'``. In principle, every other `Average and Variance statistical function of Numpy <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.statistics.html>`_ that can take an array as a single parameter is fine as well (but it is not guaranteed that it'll necessarily make sense, though).

    Function to compute a spectrogram  of a time series ``x`` over multiple processes.
    This is based on `scipy.signal.welch <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.welch.html>`_ function, with the key parameters redefined in units of seconds instead of points. This function estimates over different processes the PSD of the data every ``stride`` seconds by means of some modified versions of the Welch's method, that is averaging windowed (and possibly zero padded) FFTs of the data over overlapping segments. Valid averaging methods are the usual ``'mean'`` and ``'median'``, more robust to outliers in the data (such as glitches and other non-stationarities).
    Notice that, depending on the choice of ``fftlength``, ``overlap``, and the original sampling frequency of the data ``fs``, the PSD may not consider the last data in each segment. This typically happens when ``fftlength-overlap`` is not a sub-multiple of the ``stride``.
    If you prefer to avoid losing data in each segments, but speed and time spacing at exactly the value of ``stride`` is not required, the use of the other ``avg_spectro`` function is preferrable. This one is usually faster, though, making use of multiple processes.

    """
    Multi-Taper Method (MTM) by D.J. Thomson is a non-parametric way of computing the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a time series averaging various periodograms obained by means of a sequence of orthonormal windows. The latter can be given by a Sequence of Discrete Prolate Spheroidal functions (DPSS), that is, the eigenvectors (*eigentapers*) solution to the variational problem of minimizing the leakage outside of a window *W* (in the frequency domain, the PSD of these functions is maximally contained inside *W*), constrained to a norm given for example by the ell-2 norm: their sum of squares is equal to one. This gives a set of independent periodogram estimates, which can be averaged over the number of windws used. The advantage of doing this is a reduction of the variance by a factor equals to the number of tapers used. This is similar to the Welch method, where a large sequence of data is divided into segments and averaged over them. 
      
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        The time series we want to compute the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of
    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the time series ``x``
    NhBW : float, optional
        Normalized half-Bandwidth of the windows to use, which are then found to be a sequence of orthogonal Discrete Prolate Spheroidal
        functions with spectra maximally concentrated in the (normalized) interval (-NhBW,+NhBW), and subject to to the normalization condition
        given by ``norm``. The bandwidth of the windows is normalized with respect to the zoroth-frequency f0 = 1/T = fs/N, where N is the number
        of data points in ``x``
    Kmax : int, optional
        This parameter determines the maximum number of orthogonal windows to use. Notice that if ``eigenthr`` is set lower than 1, than a smaller number of windows can be eventually used, depending on their eigenvalues (that is, their concentration ratio inside the interval determined by ``NhBW``). In choosing this value, take also in mind that usually the first 2``NhBW``-1 eigenvalues are close to 1, while the latter are close to zero. If ``eigenthr`` is not provided, the previous condition is applied. Set ``eigenthr`` to 1 if you want all the ``Kmax`` that you set. Also, the frequency resolution of this estimate will eventually be ``fs``*``Kmax``/``len(x)``. Take this in mind when deciding the compromize between resolution and variance
    eigenthr : float, optional
        Only windows with eigenvalue higher than this threshold are eventually used; the latter are normalized to be in (1,0). This is done in order to avoid leakage with windows that are truncated at the borders of the data segment: this will cause a characteristic 1/f behaviour of the ASD. Select a higher value of this parameter if you notice this. If not provided, the number of window to use is set such that: ``Kmax`` = 2``NhBW``-1
    norm : {2, 'approximate', 'subsample'} | None, optional
        Leave it equals to 2, corresponding to the ell-2 norm (summ of squares equal to 1). Refer to `scipy.signal.windows.dpss documentation <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.windows.dpss.html>`_ for more details
    nproc : int, optional
        Number of proccessors for parallel computing. If set to one (default) no parallel computing is performed, and the various periodograms are obtained through a list comprehension
    return_eigens : bool, optional
        If ``True``, the function also returns a list of eigenvalues (concentration ratios) corresponding to the previous parameter, and possibly truncated by ``eigenthr`` parameter
    **PSDkwgs : dict, optional
        Other optional arguments to compute the periodogram PSD.

    """
    Function to compute a specttrogram  of a time series ``x`` by means of the Multi-Taper Method.
    This function integrates the ``mtm_psd()`` function with the ``multi_spectro`` function. For each segment of data of duration set with the parameter ``stride``, the PSD is estimated with the MTM method. This allows a better variance for shorter segments of data with respect to the Welch's method implemented in the other function. Notice also that this doesn't need to declare an ``fftlength`` since all the data in the stride is included in this transformation. Also, there is no loss of data.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Time series of measurement values
    stride : float
        Exact number of seconds for each PSD estimate, and therefore in each single column of the spectrogram

        Epoch where to start the returned time vector
    fs : int, optional 
        sampling frequency of the dataset. Default to 1 if not provided
    NhBW : float, optional
        Normalized half-Bandwidth of the windows to use
    Kmax : int, optional
        Maximum number of orthogonal windows to use
    eigenthr : float, optional
        Only windows with eigenvalue higher than this threshold are eventually used. If not provided, the number of window to use is set such that: ``Kmax`` = 2``NhBW``-1
    norm : {2, 'approximate', 'subsample'} | None, optional
