Molass Legacy is an open-source version of [MOLASS](https://pfwww.kek.jp/saxs/MOLASSE.html) a tool for the analysis of SEC-SAXS experiment data currently hosted at [Photon Factory](https://www2.kek.jp/imss/pf/eng/) and [SPring-8](http://www.spring8.or.jp/en/), Japan.

To install this package, use pip as follows.

```
pip install -U molass_legacy
```

If you want to use Excel reporting features, install with the `excel` extra:

```
pip install -U molass[excel]
```

> **Note:** The `excel` extra installs `pywin32`, which is required for Excel reporting and only works on Windows.
