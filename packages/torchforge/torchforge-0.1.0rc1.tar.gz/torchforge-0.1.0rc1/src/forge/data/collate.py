    """
    Generic collate function for packed samples from an IterablePackedDataset.
    Stacks tensors from all samples in the batch, while keeping non-tensor values
    as lists. Handles metrics by extending them into a single list. Delegates
    attention mask creation to a provided `mask_fn` callable that expects
    `document_ids` and `device` parameters to generate masks on-the-fly for
    packed sequences.
    Args:
        batch (list[dict[str, Any]]): A list of dictionaries containing samples.
        mask_fn (callable): A function that generates attention masks for packed sequences.
        device (str): The device to use for the tensors.
    Returns:
        dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the collated samples.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If all samples do not have the same keys.
