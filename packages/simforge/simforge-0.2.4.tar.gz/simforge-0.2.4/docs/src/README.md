# SimForge

**SimForge** is a framework for creating diverse virtual environments through procedural generation.

## Motivation

Procedural generation is a powerful technique for creating unique scenarios with an infinite number of variations. Although the gaming industry has embraced this approach for creating diverse and realistic environments, other fields, such as robotics and space exploration, have yet to leverage its potential fully. SimForge aims to bridge this gap by providing a unified and extensible framework for generating assets and integrating them into external game engines and physics simulators.

## Overview

The framework implements a modular approach with three ecosystem-agnostic concepts:

- [**Assets**](assets/index.md)
- [**Generators**](generators/index.md)
- [**Integrations**](integrations/index.md)

## Getting Started
