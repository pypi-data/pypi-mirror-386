# New Assets

SimForge [Assets](../assets/index.md) are always registered with a specific [Generator](../generators/index.md) that is responsible for creating them. This means that you first need to select one of the available generators before you define new assets. Each generator leverages a different set of tools and libraries to create assets, so the process of creating and defining assets will vary depending on your choice. Please refer to the generator documentation you intend to use for more information on how to create new assets.

In case you want to create assets with an external tool or library that does not have a SimForge generator yet, consider visiting the [New Generator](generators.md) guide to learn how to implement one.
