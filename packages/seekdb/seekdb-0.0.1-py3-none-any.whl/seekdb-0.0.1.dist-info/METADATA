# What is OceanBase SeekDB?
OceanBase SeekDB is a brand-new AI Native database product developed by the OceanBase team. Built upon the core engine of the OceanBase database, it further meets the demands of AI application scenarios, supporting essential AI features such as comprehensive vector indexing, full-text indexing, hybrid search, and AI Functions. To continuously enhance the developer experience, SeekDB has undergone extensive resource and performance optimization, allowing it to run in environments with as little as 1 core CPU and 1GB of memory. It features minimal deployment and starts up in seconds, supporting both client/server and embedded deployment modes to significantly lower the barrier to use.

## Core Features
### üöÄ Minimal Deployment, Built for Developers and AI Agents
