    "description": "Displays a UI component to inform the user that the agent has completed its turn and is now waiting for a user reply.\n\nThis tool should be called as the final action in an assistant's turn after providing a complete response or asking a question. It signals that the agent is done processing and is awaiting the user's next instruction or answer.\n\nThe `recommended_next_prompts` field can be used to suggest up to three possible follow-up responses the user might choose from. These should be **valid, reasonable, and contextually relevant** to the conversation at the time the tool is called. They are meant to guide the user toward likely next actions or replies without restricting them.\n\nWhen generating these suggestions:\n- Include at most **three** prompts.\n- Ensure **each prompt is distinctly different** â€” do not provide multiple variations of the same phrase.\n- Suggestions should be short, clear, and actionable.\n- At least one suggestion should be a generic progression option such as \"Continue\".\n- Other prompts should be tailored to the specific conversation or content just presented.\n\nExamples of valid `recommended_next_prompts` for different contexts:\n- After explaining a concept: [\"Continue\", \"Can you give an example?\", \"Explain it in simpler terms\"]\n- After showing data: [\"Continue\", \"Show me a chart of this data\", \"Compare with last month\"]\n\nArgs:\n    notebook_path: Path to the notebook file. System-managed, should not be set by LLM.\n    recommended_next_prompts: An optional list of up to three distinct, relevant suggestions for how the user might respond next.\n\nReturns:\n    bool: True if the waiting reply box was shown successfully, False otherwise.\n",
