| This addon extends the functionality of the ``fs_folder`` module to
  improve the user experience when working with folders in an external
  storage supporting WebDAV (e.g. Nextcloud).
| This module is not strictly required to use WebDAV storage.

Configuration
=============

To configure a WebDAV storage with fs_folder, you need to install
``webdav4[fsspec]`` library to make the webdav protocol available in the
FS Storage configuration.

- The Directory Path depends on your webdav provider. Exemple for
  Nextcloud : ``/remote.php/dav/files/username/path/Directory``.
- Add the login and url informations in the Options:

::

   {
       "base_url": "https://cloud.domain.com",
       "auth": ["username", "password"]
   }
