# THC4M3 ‚Äî Thick Client Helper for Burp
![Build](https://github.com/Pa7ch3s/THC4me/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

> **Status:** MVP (pre-release). Tested on macOS with Burp Suite Pro/Community and Java 17.
> THC4M3 is a minimal Burp extension that helps you test thick-client apps without drowning in noise: label/annotate only the traffic you care about, and generate a quick PAC file.
---

## ‚ú® What it does

- **Events table** that logs/labels interesting requests & responses  
- **Allow-lists** for **Host (regex)**, **Port (CSV)**, **MIME (regex)**  
- **Show/annotate only matching traffic** to reduce noise  
- **PAC generator** to route only your target domains via Burp  
- **Checklist sub-tab** for thick-client test setup (save/load/export)

No telemetry. Everything runs inside Burp.

# üîß Install

1. Download the latest `thc4m3.jar` from **[Releases](../../releases)**.  
2. In Burp: **Extensions ‚Üí Installed ‚Üí Add ‚Üí Java** and select the JAR.  
3. Confirm the **THC4M3** tab appears.

> If you‚Äôre on macOS and running Burp from a mounted **.dmg**, copy it to `/Applications` first.  
> If HTTPS fails due to TLS interception, install Burp‚Äôs CA certificate in your OS trust store or use `curl -k` during smoke tests.

# ‚ö° Quick start (MVP)

1. In the **THC4M3** tab, set:
   - **Host allow (regex):** e.g. `.*(api|login|auth|gateway).*|localhost|127\.0\.0\.1`
   - **Port allow (comma):** `80,443,8080,8443`
   - **MIME allow (regex):** `^(application/json|application/xml|text/.*|application/octet-stream)$`
2. Click **Apply Filters**.
3. (Optional) Click **Generate PAC‚Ä¶** and use it in your app/OS to only proxy target hosts via Burp.

# **Smoke tests**

## Send traffic through Burp on 127.0.0.1:8080
curl --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 -k https://postman-echo.com/get -I
curl --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 -k https://postman-echo.com/post \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"hello":"world"}'

# üß© Checklist tab

A thin, practical list for thick-client setup (pinning, TLS suites, IPC/local endpoints, file I/O caches/logs/secrets, etc.).
Use Save / Load / Export‚Ä¶ to persist or share checklists for a project.

# üõ†Ô∏è Build locally

Requires Java 17 and Gradle Wrapper (included).

./gradlew clean jar
## JAR: build/libs/thc4m3.jar
unzip -p build/libs/thc4m3.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF | grep Burp-Extender-Class
## Expect: Burp-Extender-Class: com.jb.thickclient.BurpExtender

---

# ‚ùì Troubleshooting

Extension loads but no tab: Ensure you launched Burp from /Applications (macOS app sandbox prompts can block access when run from a DMG).

HTTPS failures: Install Burp CA into your OS keychain, or use -k only for quick tests.

No events appear: Confirm your Host/Port/MIME allow-lists match, then generate a PAC or point your app to the Burp proxy.

---

# üß≠ Roadmap

Backfill labeling from Proxy history

Export/Import of all settings

Status chip / counters

Richer checklist with WSTG mappings
