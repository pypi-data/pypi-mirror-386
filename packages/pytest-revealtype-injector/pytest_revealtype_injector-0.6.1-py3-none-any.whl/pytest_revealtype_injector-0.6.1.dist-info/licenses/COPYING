pytest-revealtype-injector is released under MIT license (see COPYING.mit).

Original source code comes from part of types-lxml project, which is
release under Apache-2.0 license. But as the sole author of all source
code inside this repository, it is at my own discretion to follow pytest
license because this project is taking shape as a pytest plugin.
