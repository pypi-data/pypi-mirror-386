universal_tracking:
  description:
    Auto-generated properties used to track an entity (user, plan,
    measurement, etc.).
    These tracking properties are universal. Universal, in the sense
    that we guarantee the integrity of said properties across devices.
  type: object
  properties:
    id:
      description: >
        This ID uniquely identifies this entity across devices.
        It's actually a so-called UUID (universally unique ID).
      type: string
      format: uuid
internal_tracking:
  description:
    Auto-generated properties used to track an entity (user, plan,
    measurement, etc.).
    These tracking properties are internal. Internal, in the sense
    that we guarantee the integrity of said properties within the
    device. E.g., using the device clock and device user accounts.
  type: object
  required:
    - system_begin
    # At a later point, we can add `last_internal_update_by` to track
    # the internal user that authored the update.
  properties:
    system_begin:
      description:
        The point in time of the most recent internal update
        (including create/insert) of this entity.
        E.g., when an external service synchronizes its data with
        this device.
        Note that we track `system_begin` using the
        system clock of this device.
      type: string
      format: date-time

external_tracking:
  description:
    User-provided properties used to track an entity (user, plan,
    measurement, etc.).
    These tracking properties are external. External, in the sense
    that it's up the the user (of this API) to guarantee the
    integrity of said properties. Think of these properties as
    a user-provided "cookie" (like in the browser) that we store
    with each entity. The device simply stores this "cookie" and
    returns it along with the rest of the data on each request.
    What you (the user of this API) use this "cookie" for is
    completely up to you.
  type: object
  required:
    - last_application_update_at
    # At a later point, we can add `last_user_update_by` to track
    # the external user that authored the update.
  properties:
    last_application_update_at:
      description:
        The point in time of the most recent external update
        (including create/insert) of this entity.
        E.g., when a user (of this API) changes a record meant for this
        device. This is the point in time of the change to the record and
        not the point in time of synchronization with this device
        (see `system_begin` for the latter).
        Note that the user (of this API) provides `last_application_update_at`.
        Therefore, `last_application_update_at` follows the user's clock (e.g.,
        the clock on the user's laptop).

user_role:
  description:
    The user role defines the set of privileges that the corresponding

plaintext_password_or_null:
  description:
    The device authenticates users via this password.
    Internally, the device stores a cryptographically-secure hash

  description:
    Personal identification number (PIN).
    The device authenticates users via this PIN.
    Internally, the device stores a cryptographically-secure hash
    (Blowfish-based, variant 2a) of the PIN.
