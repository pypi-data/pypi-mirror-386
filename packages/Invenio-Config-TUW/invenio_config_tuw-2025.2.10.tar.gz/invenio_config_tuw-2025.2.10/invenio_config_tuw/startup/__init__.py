"""Invenio-Config-TUW hacks and overrides to be applied on application startup.

This module provides a blueprint whose sole purpose is to execute some code exactly
once during application startup (via ``bp.record_once()``).
These functions will be executed after the Invenio modules' extensions have been
initialized, and thus we can rely on them being already available.
