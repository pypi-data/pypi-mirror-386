    """
    Create a nanowire network represented by a NetworkX graph. Wires are 
    represented by the graph's vertices, while the wire junctions are 
    represented by the graph's edges.

    The text file input is assumed to be in two columns: x and y.
    Each wire is a pair of rows, one row containing the start point and the
    following containing the end point. The first two pairs of rows are the
    electrodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        Text file containing the start and end locations of the wires.

    conductance : float, optional
        The junction conductance of the nanowires where they intersect.
        Given in units of (Ron)^-1.

    diameter : float, optional
        The diameter of each nanowire. Given in units of D0.

    resistivity : float, optional
        The resistivity of each nanowire. Given in units of rho0.

    units : dict, optional
        Dictionary of custom base units. Defaults to None which will use the 
        default units given in `units.py`

    Returns
    -------
    NWN : Graph
        The created random nanowire network.
