# 🧩 ShareFromCLI

**ShareFromCLI** is a simple yet powerful Python-based CLI tool that lets developers share files and command snippets effortlessly from the terminal.  
It’s built for developers, workshops, and teams who need a quick, secure way to share files and code — without any setup or cloud dependency.

---

## 🚀 Installation

Install **ShareFromCLI** globally via **pip**:

```bash
pip install sharefromcli
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### 🏗️ Create a New Share Command

To create a new command for your file:

```bash
sharefromcli
```

Then follow the prompts:

```
✅ Token loaded successfully!
Do you want to create cmd or read the file (C/R): C
Pick the file name to read the content: 1.txt
```

Once done, you’ll get a shareable command like:

```
Here is your command below to install content:
> pip install sharefromcli
> sharefromcli read <id>
```

You can now share this `<id>` with anyone — they can retrieve the same file easily.

---

### 📥 Read a Shared File

To view or download a shared file:

```bash
sharefromcli read <file_id>
```

Then choose your preferred option:

```
Do you want to see the content or download the content as .txt (see/download): see
```

The file content or a downloadable `.txt` file will be returned instantly.

---

## ⏳ Expiry Policy

All shared file IDs automatically **expire after 7 days** for security and cleanup.  
Once expired, the link or ID will no longer work.

---

## 🧠 Example Workflow

#### Step 1: Create a Share Command
```bash
sharefromcli
```
→ Choose **C** (create)  
→ Pick a file, e.g., `1.txt`

#### Step 2: Share Command

sharefromcli read abc123
```

#### Step 3: Read File (Receiver)

```
→ Choose to **see** or **download** content.
