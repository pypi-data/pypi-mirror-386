# About

Semantics.py3 is a sharing name space for the protocol layer of 
[Semantics-*](), of the Python3 version.

The installed module is

```
    site-packages/semanticshare
```

To import the modules, e.g. in Python source,

```

for examples.

# May Be

This name space is supposed to be managed in service node, with
some IDE plugin (in the future, may be sponsored) to submit and 
manage this shared lib, and even install only needed parts.
