class Colley:  # pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
    """
    Calculates each team's Colley ratings

    Parameters
    ----------
    goals_home : array-like
        List of goals scored by the home teams

    goals_away : array-like
        List of goals scored by the away teams

    teams_home : array-like
        List of names of the home teams

    teams_away : array-like
        List of names of the away teams

    include_draws : bool
        Should tied results be included in the ratings?

    draw_weight : float
        if include_draws is `True` then this sets the weighting applied to tied scores.
        For example `0.5` means a draw is worth half a win, `0.333` means a draw
        is a third of a win etc
