# Installation

## System Dependencies

pythaiidcard requires several system-level dependencies for PC/SC smartcard communication.

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y pcscd libpcsclite-dev python3-dev swig
```

**What these packages do:**

- `pcscd` - PC/SC Smart Card Daemon (manages smartcard readers)
- `libpcsclite-dev` - Development files for PC/SC Lite library
- `python3-dev` - Python development headers (required for pyscard compilation)
- `swig` - Interface compiler for Python bindings

### Other Linux Distributions

=== "Fedora/RHEL/CentOS"
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install -y pcsc-lite pcsc-lite-devel python3-devel swig
    ```

=== "Arch Linux"
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S pcsclite swig python
    ```

=== "openSUSE"
    ```bash
    sudo zypper install pcsc-lite pcsc-lite-devel python3-devel swig
    ```

### Verify Installation

After installing system dependencies, verify that the PC/SC daemon is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status pcscd
```

If it's not running, start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl start pcscd
sudo systemctl enable pcscd  # Enable on boot
```

## Python Package Installation

### Using pip (Recommended)

```bash
pip install pythaiidcard
```

### Using uv (Fast)

```bash
uv add pythaiidcard
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ninyawee/pythaiidcard.git
cd pythaiidcard
uv sync --group dev
```

## Dependency Check

pythaiidcard automatically checks for required system dependencies on Linux systems. If dependencies are missing, you'll see a helpful error message:

```python
from pythaiidcard import ThaiIDCardReader

reader = ThaiIDCardReader()
# SystemDependencyError: Missing required system dependencies:
#
#   ✗ PC/SC Smart Card Daemon (pcscd)
#   ✗ PC/SC Lite development library (libpcsclite-dev)
#
# To install missing dependencies, run:
#
#   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y pcscd libpcsclite-dev python3-dev swig
```

### Skipping the Check

If you've installed dependencies via other means or want to skip the check:

```python
reader = ThaiIDCardReader(skip_system_check=True)
```

```

Then log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

## Verify Installation

Test that everything is working:

```python
from pythaiidcard import ThaiIDCardReader

# List available readers
readers = ThaiIDCardReader.list_readers()
for r in readers:
    print(f"Reader {r.index}: {r.name}")
    print(f"  Status: {'Card Present' if r.connected else 'No Card'}")
```

## Development Installation

For development with all optional dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ninyawee/pythaiidcard.git
cd pythaiidcard

# Install with development dependencies
uv sync --group dev

# Install system dependencies
mise run install-deps  # If you have mise installed
```

### Development Tools

The development environment includes:

- **ruff** - Linting and formatting
- **streamlit** - Web UI for debugging
- **mkdocs-material** - Documentation generation

### Running Tests
