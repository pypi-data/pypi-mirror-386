## Tested Card Readers

### Alcor Link AK9563 (Alcor Micro)

**Model:** Alcor Link AK9563 00 00
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Compatible
**Recommended Mode:** On-demand (manual read only)

#### Capabilities

!!! success "Working Features"
    - ‚úÖ Card detection (insertion/removal events)
    - ‚úÖ Manual card reading (via REST API or WebSocket command)
    - ‚úÖ Photo extraction (20-part JPEG, 5KB)
    - ‚úÖ All data fields (CID, name, address, dates, etc.)
    - ‚úÖ SHARED connection mode (SCARD_SHARE_SHARED)

!!! failure "Known Limitations"
    - ‚ùå Automatic read on card insertion
    - ‚ùå Multiple consecutive hardware reads without card removal

#### Hardware Limitations

##### Cannot Auto-Read on Insertion

**Symptom:** Card detection works, but automatic read fails with connection errors
**Error:** `Card was removed. (0x80100069)` immediately after insertion
**Cause:** Hardware/driver limitation - reader needs stabilization time after card insertion

!!! tip "Workaround"
    Disable auto-read and use on-demand mode (default in v2.2.0+). The system will detect card insertion and wait for manual read command.

##### Requires Card Removal Between Reads

**Symptom:** First read succeeds, subsequent reads fail or hang

!!! success "Solution"
    Version 2.1.0 implemented caching - serves cached data for repeated reads. Remove card to trigger fresh hardware read.

**User Workflow:**

1. Insert card
2. Click "Read Card" button (first read from hardware)
3. Data is cached for instant access
4. Remove card when done or when fresh read is needed

##### Connection Mode Requirements

!!! warning "Important"
    **Required:** SCARD_SHARE_SHARED mode (not EXCLUSIVE)
    **Reason:** EXCLUSIVE mode causes "card was reset" errors after first read
    **Fixed:** v2.0.0 changed default connection mode to SHARED

#### Configuration

##### Recommended Settings (Default)

```python
from api_server.services.card_monitor import CardMonitorService
from api_server.services.connection_manager import ConnectionManager

manager = ConnectionManager()
monitor = CardMonitorService(
    connection_manager=manager,
    auto_read_on_insert=False  # Default in v2.2.0+
)
```

##### Alternative (Not Recommended for AK9563)

```python
monitor = CardMonitorService(
    connection_manager=manager,
    auto_read_on_insert=True  # May fail with this reader
)
```

#### Usage Notes

**Best Practices:**

1. ‚úÖ Use on-demand mode (default)
2. ‚úÖ Detect card insertion events
3. ‚úÖ Prompt user to trigger manual read via UI
4. ‚úÖ Serve cached data for subsequent requests
5. ‚úÖ Instruct user to remove card for fresh read

**Performance Results:**

| Operation | Time | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Card insertion detection | < 1 second | ‚úÖ Working |
| Manual read with photo | 2-3 seconds | ‚úÖ Working |
| Cached read response | < 10ms | ‚úÖ Working |
| Card removal detection | < 5 seconds | ‚úÖ Working |
| Auto-read on insertion | N/A | ‚ùå Fails |

## General Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- PC/SC compliant smart card reader
- Support for T=0 or T=1 protocol
- Compatible with Thai National ID card
  **ATR:** `3B 79 96 00 00 54 48 20 4E 49 44 20 31 37`

### System Dependencies (Linux)

```bash
# Required packages
sudo apt-get install pcscd libpcsclite-dev swig

# Start pcscd service
sudo systemctl start pcscd
sudo systemctl enable pcscd
```

See [Installation Guide](installation.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Verification

#### Check Reader Detection

```bash
# List all connected readers
uv run python -c "from pythaiidcard import ThaiIDCardReader; print(ThaiIDCardReader.list_readers())"
```

#### Start API Server

```bash
# Start the desktop client server
uv run pythaiidcard-server

# Check server status
curl http://localhost:8765/api/status
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "version": "2.2.0",
  "readers_available": 1,
  "card_detected": true,
  "reader_name": "Alcor Link AK9563 00 00"
}
```

## API Server Modes

### On-Demand Mode (Default - v2.2.0+)

**Behavior:**

1. Card inserted ‚Üí `card_inserted` event broadcast
2. No automatic read attempt
3. User triggers manual read via button/API
4. First read fetches from hardware and caches
5. Subsequent reads serve cached data
6. Card removal invalidates cache

**Configuration:**

```python
CardMonitorService(manager, auto_read_on_insert=False)
```

**WebSocket Event:**

```json
{
  "type": "card_inserted",
  "message": "Card detected - ready for reading",
  "reader": "Alcor Link AK9563 00 00"
}
```

### Auto-Read Mode (Optional)

!!! warning "Compatibility"
    Auto-read mode may not work with all readers (e.g., Alcor Link AK9563). Use only with tested, compatible hardware.

**Behavior:**

1. Card inserted ‚Üí Immediately reads from hardware
2. Photo data included automatically
3. Data cached for subsequent requests

**Configuration:**

```python
CardMonitorService(manager, auto_read_on_insert=True)
```

**WebSocket Event:**

```json
{
  "type": "card_inserted",
  "message": "Card detected - reading automatically...",
  "reader": "Reader Name"
}
```
