- Shows card photo if available
- Quick copy buttons for CID, names, and address
- Export buttons for JSON, CSV, and photo data
- Card validity status and expiry warnings
- NHSO health insurance data display
- Laser ID display with copy functionality

## Troubleshooting

### No Readers Found
- Ensure your card reader is properly connected
- On Linux, check if `pcscd` service is running:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status pcscd
  ```
- Install required packages:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install pcscd libpcsclite-dev
  ```

### No Card Detected
- Verify the card is properly inserted
- Try removing and reinserting the card
- Check if the card is a Thai National ID card

### Connection Errors
- Restart the pcscd service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart pcscd
  ```
- Check reader permissions
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the reader

### Photo Reading Issues
- Photo reading can take 10-20 seconds
- Watch the progress indicator
- Uncheck "Include Photo" if you only need text data

## Development

The debug interface uses:
- **Streamlit**: Web UI framework
- **pythaiidcard**: Core library for card reading
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and models
- **PIL/Pillow**: Image handling

## Features Demonstrated

This debug interface showcases all features of the `pythaiidcard` library:

- Reader scanning and selection
- Connection management
- Data reading with error handling
- Progress callbacks for long operations
- Photo extraction and display
- Data validation and parsing
- Export capabilities

## Tips

- Use the debug logs to understand the APDU command flow
- Export data for testing without physical card access
- Monitor card expiry dates for validation testing
- Test different reader types and configurations
