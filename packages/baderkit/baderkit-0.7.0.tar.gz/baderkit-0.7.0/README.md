## About

BaderKit is a python implementation of Bader's Atomic Theory of Atoms in Molecules. It is largely based on the algorithms of [Henkelman et. al.](https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/code/bader/) at UT Austin. The app is maintained by the [Warren Lab](https://materials-lab.io/) at UNC Chapel Hill. For information on installation and use, see the [docs](https://sweav02.github.io/baderkit/)
