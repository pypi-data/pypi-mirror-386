## Purpose

This package is designed to simplify CCBHC reporting by automating the measurement process. It accepts all relevant clinical —such as PHQ-9s, AUDITs, and SDOH screenings— and insurance data and returns a labeled DataFrame indicating whether each patient meets the criteria for the chosen CCBHC measurements. The package is designed to be comprehensive in that you can give it ALL your historical data and it will output EVERY patient labeled in EVERY Measurement Year for a given Measurement. Take a look at this DEP-REM-6 example:

![simple example of how the package works](https://github.com/Pesach-Tikvah-Hope-Development-Inc/CCBHC_Measurements/blob/main/ccbhc_measurements/diagrams/Simple%20CCBHC_Measurements%20Example.png?raw=true)

[Click here for the more detailed DEP-REM-6 example pdf][Dep Rem 6 Diagram]

### 1. Data Processing
Our code is simple:
1. Import the Measurement you want to calculate.
2. Give it the required data (downloaded excel reports from your EHR, query data from SQL, or whatever)
3. Run ```get_all_submeasures()```. Under the hood, ```get_all_submeasures()``` determines which data meets the Measurments criteria and which does not.
4. Export your data to your preferred tool for analysis. If you want to keep it in pandas, you already have it. If you want to use Excel, or Power BI, you can export it there as well!

### 2. Dashboard Display
We've also created a base Power BI file as a foundation for a dashboard. [Check out the dashboard folder here.](CCBHC_Measurements/ccbhc_measurements/dashboard/)

The definition for these Measurements can be found at <https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/ccbhc-quality-measures-technical-specifications-manual.pdf>  

**IMPORTANT** We unsure if we will be implementing the I-SERV Measurement and its SubMeasures. We would like to hear your thoughts on the matter, feel free to email us and let us know what you think.

Moving forward, our focus will shift from the SAMHSA-required measurements to those mandated by New York State.

## Code Demonstration

This is a basic demonstration for the Dep-Rem-6 Measurement, see [here](https://github.com/Pesach-Tikvah-Hope-Development-Inc/CCBHC_Measurements/blob/main/ccbhc_measurements/demos) for more in depth demonstrations

```sh
import pandas as pd
import ccbhc_measurements as ccbhc
```

#### - Step 1: Load in the data into Pandas Dataframes

```sh
all_inclusive_excel_file = r"../file/path/to/Dep Rem Data.xlsx"
phq_data = pd.read_xlsx(all_inclusive_excel_file, sheet_name = "phq9")
diagnosis_data = pd.read_xlsx(all_inclusive_excel_file, sheet_name = "diagnosis")
demographic_data = pd.read_xlsx(all_inclusive_excel_file, sheet_name = "demographic")
insurance_data = pd.read_xlsx(all_inclusive_excel_file, sheet_name = "insurance")
```

#### - Step 2: Ensure that the dataframes follows the correct schema

[Dep Rem 6 Required Data Input and Output Diagram][Dep Rem 6 Diagram]

```sh
phq_data = phq_data[["patient_id","patient_DOB","encounter_id","encounter_datetime","total_score"]].copy()
diagnosis_data = diagnosis_data[["patient_id","encounter_datetime","diagnosis"]].copy()
demographic_data = demographic_data[["patient_id","race","ethnicity"]].copy()
insurance_data = insurance_data[["patient_id","insurance","start_datetime","end_datetime"]].copy()
```

#### - Step 3: Calculate Dep-Rem

```sh
submeasure_data = [phq_data,diagnosis_data,demographic_data,insurance_data]
measure = ccbhc.Dep_Rem(submeasure_data)
results = measure.get_all_submeasures()
for name, data in results.items():
    data.to_excel(name+".xlsx", index=False)
```
##### Example Data Output:

| patient_id | patient_measurement_year_id | encounter_id | age | medicaid | numerator | numerator_reason            |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | --- | -------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1          | 1-2024                      | 1            | 18+ | FALSE    | **TRUE**      | <mark>**Has Remission**</mark>                |
| 2          | 1-2025                      | 3            | 18+ | FALSE    | **FALSE**     | <mark>**Remission Period not Reached**</mark> |
| 3          | 3-2024                      | 4            | 18+ | FALSE    | **FALSE**     | <mark>**No PHQ-9 Follow Up**</mark>           |
| 4          | 4-2024                      | 5            | 18+ | FALSE    | **FALSE**     | <mark>**No Remission**</mark>                 |

#### - Step 4: Create a Dashboard in Power BI (Optional)
We've created an example dashboard in Power BI for easy implementation but feel free to use the analysis tool of your choice. Feel free to download it from [the dashboard folder](CCBHC_Measurements/ccbhc_measurements/dashboard/).
