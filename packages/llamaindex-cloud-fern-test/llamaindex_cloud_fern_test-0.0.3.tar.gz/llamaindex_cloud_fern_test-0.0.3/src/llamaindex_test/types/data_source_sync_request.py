    Request model for syncing pipeline data sources.

    Notes:
    - This endpoint pulls from the 3p data source and parses.
    - We accept pipeline_file_ids for now because callers (e.g. add_files_to_pipeline)
      often have these IDs handy. Internally we map them to external IDs to filter
      the reader, which enumerates by external ID.
    - Likely to evolve to take external IDs directly; keeping this for convenience.
