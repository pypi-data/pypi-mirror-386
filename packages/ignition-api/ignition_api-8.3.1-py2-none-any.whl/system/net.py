    The object created by this function is a wrapper around Java's
    HttpClient class. Usage requires creating a JythonHttpClient object
    with a call to system.net.httpClient, then calling a method (such as
    get(), post()) on the JythonHttpClient to actually issue a request.

    Args:
        timeout: A value, in milliseconds, to set the client's connect
            timeout setting to. Defaults to 60000. Optional.
        bypass_cert_validation: A boolean indicating whether the client
            should attempt to validate the certificates of remote
            servers, if connecting via HTTPS/SSL. Defaults to False.
            Optional.
        username: A string indicating the username to use for
            authentication if the remote server requests authentication;
            specifically, by responding with a WWW-Authenticate or
            Proxy-Authenticate header. Only supports Basic
            authentication. If username is specified but not password,
            an empty string will be used for the password in the Basic
            Authentication response. Defaults to None. Optional.
        password: A string indicating the password to use for
            authentication. Defaults to None. Optional.
        proxy: The address of a proxy server, which will be used for
            HTTP and HTTPS traffic. If a port is not specified as part
            of that address, it will be assumed from the protocol in the
            URL, i.e. 80/443. Defaults to None. Optional.
        cookie_policy: A string representing this client's cookie
            policy. Accepts values "ACCEPT_ALL", "ACCEPT_NONE", and
            "ACCEPT_ORIGINAL_SERVER". Defaults to
            "ACCEPT_ORIGINAL_SERVER". Optional.
        redirect_policy: A string representing this client's redirect
            policy. Acceptable values are listed below. Defaults to
            "Normal". Optional.
        version: A string specifying either HTTP_2 or HTTP_1_1 for the
            HTTP protocol. When omitted, the previous default of HTTP_2
            is implied. Optional.
        customizer: A reference to a function. This function will be
            called with one argument (an instance of
            HttpClient.Builder). The function should operate on that
            builder instance, which allows for customization of the
            created HTTP client. Defaults to None. Optional.

    Returns:
        An object wrapped around an instance of Java's HttpClient class.
        The httpClient object has methods that can be called to execute
        HTTP requests against a server.

            HTML email. Will auto-detect if omitted. Optional.
        to: A list of email addresses to send to.
        attachmentNames: A list of attachment names. Attachment names
            must have the correct extension for the file type or an
            error will occur. Optional.
        attachmentData: A list of attachment data, in binary format.
        timeout: A timeout for the email, specified in milliseconds.
            Defaults to 5 minutes (60,000*5). Optional.
        username: If specified, will be used to authenticate with the
            SMTP host. Optional.
        password: If specified, will be used to authenticate with the
            SMTP host. Optional.
        priority: Priority for the message, from "1" to "5", with "1"
            being highest priority. Defaults to "3" (normal) priority.
            Optional.
        smtpProfile: If specified, the named SMTP profile defined
            in the Gateway will be used. If this keyword is present, the
            smtp, username, and password keywords will be ignored.
            Optional.
        cc: A list of email addresses to carbon copy. Only available if
            a smtpProfile is used. Optional.
        bcc: A list of email addresses to blind carbon copy. Only
            available if a smtpProfile is used. Optional.

            failure. Defaults to 0. Only available if a smtpProfile is
            used. Optional.
        replyTo: An optional list of addresses to have the recipients
