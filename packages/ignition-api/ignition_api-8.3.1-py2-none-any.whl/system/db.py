    Database transactions are used to execute multiple queries in an

    transaction which will make all operations since the last commit not
    take place. The transaction is given a new unique string code, which
    is then returned. You can then use this code as the tx argument for
    other system.db.* function calls to execute various types of queries
    using this transaction.

    An open transaction consumes one database connection until it is
    closed. Because leaving connections open indefinitely would exhaust
    the connection pool, each transaction is given a timeout. Each time
    the transaction is used, the timeout timer is reset. For example, if
    you make a transaction with a timeout of one minute, you must
    complete that transaction within a minute. If a transaction is
    detected to have timed out, it will be automatically closed and its
    transaction id will no longer be valid.

    If no results are returned from the query, the special value None is

        query: A SQL query (typically a SELECT) to run as a prepared
            statement with placeholders (?) denoting where the arguments
            go, that should be designed to return one row and one
            column.

            placeholder (?) found in the query.
        database: The name of the database connection to execute
            against. If omitted or "", the project's default database
            connection will be used. Optional.
        tx: A transaction identifier. If omitted, the query will be
            executed in its own transaction. Optional.

    Returns:
         The value from the first row and first column of the results.

    """Runs a query against a database connection, returning the number
    of rows affected.

    Typically this is an UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE query. If no database
    is specified, or the database is the empty-string "", then the
    current project's default database connection will be used.

    Note:
        You may want to use the runPrepUpdate query if your query is
        constructed with user input (to avoid the user's input from
        breaking your syntax) or if you need to insert binary or BLOB
        data.

    Args:
        query: A SQL query, usually an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE query,
            to run.
        database: The name of the database connection to execute
            against. If omitted or "", the project's default database
            connection will be used.
        tx: A transaction identifier. If omitted, the update will be
            executed in its own transaction.
        getKey: A flag indicating whether or not the result should be
            the number of rows returned (getKey=0) or the newly
            generated key value that was created as a result of the
            update (getKey=1). Not all databases support automatic
            retrieval of generated keys.
        skipAudit: A flag which, if set to True, will cause the update
            query to skip the audit system. Useful for some queries that
            have fields which won't fit into the audit log.

    Returns:
        The number of rows affected by the query, or the key value that
        was generated, depending on the value of the getKey flag.
