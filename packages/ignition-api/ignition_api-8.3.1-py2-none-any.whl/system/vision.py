        component: The component to move or resize.
        newX: An optional x-coordinate to move to, relative to the
            upper-left corner of the component's parent container.
        newY: An optional y-coordinate to move to, relative to the
            upper-left corner of the component's parent container.
        newWidth: An optional width for the component.
        newHeight: An optional height for the component.
        duration: An optional duration over which the transformation
            will take place. If omitted or 0, the transform will take
            place immediately.
        callback: An optional function to be called when the

        framesPerSecond: An optional frame rate argument which dictates
            how often the transformation updates over the given
            duration. The default is 60 frames per second.
        acceleration: An optional modifier to the acceleration of the
            transformation over the given duration. See system.gui
            constants for valid arguments.
        coordSpace: The coordinate space to use. When the default Screen
            Coordinates are used, the given size and position are
            absolute, as they appear in the client at runtime. When
            Designer Coordinates are used, the given size and position
