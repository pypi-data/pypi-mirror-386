# Technical Specification: pygridmappr

## Overview

This document provides a detailed technical specification of the `pygridmappr` implementation, explaining the mathematical algorithms and design decisions that ensure faithful replication of the R package `gridmappr`.

## Algorithm Description

### Problem Formulation

Given:

- A set of _n_ geographic points **P** = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ} where pᵢ = (xᵢ, yᵢ)
- A grid of dimensions _r_ × _c_ (rows × columns)
- A compactness parameter λ ∈ [0, 1]
- An optional set of spacer cells **S** ⊂ {1,...,r} × {1,...,c}

Find: An assignment function f: **P** → **G** where **G** is the set of available grid cells, such that:

1. Each point is assigned to exactly one cell: |f⁻¹(g)| ≤ 1 for all g ∈ **G**
2. The total assignment cost is minimized

### Step 1: Coordinate Normalization

Geographic coordinates are scaled to match the grid dimensions:

```
x_scaled[i] = (x[i] - x_min) / (x_max - x_min) × n_col
y_scaled[i] = (y[i] - y_min) / (y_max - y_min) × n_row
```

**Edge cases handled:**

- If x_max = x_min (collinear points), set x_range = 1
- If y_max = y_min (collinear points), set y_range = 1

This ensures the scaled coordinates span [0, n_col] × [0, n_row].

### Step 2: Grid Cell Generation

Grid cells are generated with centers at:

```
cell_center[row, col] = (col - 0.5, row - 0.5)
```

Using 0-based internal indexing:

- Row 0 corresponds to user-facing Row 1 (bottom)
- Row (n_row-1) corresponds to user-facing Row n_row (top)

**Spacer handling:** Cells in the spacer set **S** are excluded from the available cell list.

### Step 3: Cost Matrix Construction

For each point _i_ and available cell _j_, compute the base cost:

```
C_base[i,j] = (x_scaled[i] - x_grid[j])² + (y_scaled[i] - y_grid[j])²
```

This is the squared Euclidean distance between the scaled geographic position and the grid cell center.

### Step 4: Compactness Adjustment

The compactness parameter modulates costs based on distance from the grid center.

#### 4.1 Grid Center Calculation

```
center_x = n_col / 2.0
center_y = n_row / 2.0
```

#### 4.2 Distance from Center

For each grid cell _j_:

```
d_center[j] = (x_grid[j] - center_x)² + (y_grid[j] - center_y)²
```

Normalize to [0, 1]:

```
d_normalized[j] = d_center[j] / max(d_center)
```

#### 4.3 Compactness Weight

```
w = 2(λ - 0.5)
```

Where λ is the compactness parameter:

- λ = 0.5 → w = 0 (no compactness effect)
- λ = 1.0 → w = 1 (maximum attraction to center)
- λ = 0.0 → w = -1 (maximum repulsion from center)

#### 4.4 Cost Modification

For each point _i_ and cell _j_:

```
penalty[i,j] = -w × d_normalized[j]
C[i,j] = C_base[i,j] + penalty[i,j] × mean(C_base[i,:])
```

**Rationale:** The penalty is scaled by the mean cost for point _i_ to ensure the compactness effect is proportional to the geographic spread. The negative sign means:

- Positive _w_: Reduces cost for cells near center (attraction)
- Negative _w_: Increases cost for cells near center (repulsion)

### Step 5: Optimal Assignment

The assignment problem is solved using the Hungarian algorithm via `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment`:

```python
row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(C)
```

This finds the permutation σ that minimizes:

```
Σᵢ C[i, σ(i)]
```

Subject to:

- Each point assigned to exactly one cell
- Each cell receives at most one point

**Complexity:** O(n³) where n = number of points

### Step 6: Result Formatting

The assignment is converted to 1-based indexing for output:

```
result['row'] = grid_cells[assignment, 0] + 1
result['col'] = grid_cells[assignment, 1] + 1
```

## Implementation Details

### Coordinate System Conventions

**Internal (0-based):**

- Origin at (0, 0) = bottom-left
- Row 0 = bottom, Row (n_row-1) = top
- Col 0 = left, Col (n_col-1) = right
- Cell centers at (col + 0.5, row + 0.5)

**External (1-based, matches R):**

- Origin at (1, 1) = bottom-left
- Row 1 = bottom, Row n_row = top
- Col 1 = left, Col n_col = right

**Spacer specification:** Users provide spacers as (row, col) tuples using 1-based indexing.

### Numerical Stability

Several measures ensure numerical stability:

1. **Distance normalization:** Distances from center are normalized to [0, 1]
2. **Relative scaling:** Compactness penalty is scaled by mean geographic distance
3. **Integer grid coordinates:** Grid positions use exact arithmetic where possible
4. **避免 division by zero:** Special handling when geographic extent is zero

### Determinism

The implementation is fully deterministic:

- No random initialization
- Hungarian algorithm is deterministic
- Same inputs always produce same outputs
- This enables reproducible research

## Quality Metrics

### Distance Metrics

After allocation, quality is assessed by comparing scaled geographic positions to grid positions:

```python
distance[i] = √((x_scaled[i] - x_grid[assignment[i]])² +
                (y_scaled[i] - y_grid[assignment[i]])²)
```

**Metrics computed:**

- **Mean distance:** `mean(distance)`
- **Total distance:** `sum(distance)`
- **Max distance:** `max(distance)`
- **RMSE:** `√(mean(distance²))`

Lower values indicate better preservation of geographic relationships.

## Comparison with R Implementation

### Identical Behavior

- **Algorithm:** Both use linear assignment (Hungarian algorithm)
- **Cost function:** Identical squared Euclidean distance
- **Compactness:** Same mathematical formulation
- **Coordinate system:** Both use 1-based indexing with bottom-left origin
- **Spacers:** Same specification format

| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Solver         | R's `lpSolve` or similar | `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` |
| Data structure | tibble                   | pandas DataFrame                       |
| Plotting       | ggplot2                  | matplotlib                             |

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Input Validation

1. **Missing columns:** Error if 'x' or 'y' not in DataFrame
2. **Compactness range:** Error if not in [0, 1]
3. **Grid dimensions:** Error if n_row < 1 or n_col < 1
4. **Insufficient cells:** Error if available cells < number of points

### Special Cases

1. **Single point:** Works correctly, assigns to one cell
2. **Collinear points:** Handled via x_range/y_range = 1 fallback
3. **Identical points:** All assigned to different cells (arbitrary order)
4. **Empty spacers:** Treated as no spacers
5. **All cells as spacers:** Caught by validation
