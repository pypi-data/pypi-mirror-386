iatikit is a toolkit for using [IATI data](https://iatistandard.org/). It includes a query language wrapper around [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath), to make dealing with disparate IATI versions easier.

The name was inspired by [Open Contracting](https://www.open-contracting.org/)'s [ocdskit](https://pypi.org/project/ocdskit/).
