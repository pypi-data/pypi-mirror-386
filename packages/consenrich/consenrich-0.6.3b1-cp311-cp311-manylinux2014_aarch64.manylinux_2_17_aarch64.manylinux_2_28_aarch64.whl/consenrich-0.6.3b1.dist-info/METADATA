# Consenrich

Consenrich is an adaptive linear state estimator that yields genome-wide, uncertainty-calibrated signal tracks from noisy multi-sample HTS data.

</p>


Special emphasis is placed on computational efficiency, model interpretability, and practical utility for downstream tasks that require well-resolved genome-wide signal estimates and uncertainty quantification across samples, such as:

* Consensus detection of open chromatin regions, TF footprints, nucleosome occupancy, histone modification
* Candidate selection and boundary refinement for differential analyses, fine-mapping, reporter assays, etc.

[**See the Documentation**](https://nolan-h-hamilton.github.io/Consenrich/) for usage examples, installation details, configuration options, and an API reference.
