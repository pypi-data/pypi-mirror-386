### How do I get set up?
The following links contain installation instructions for the supported platforms:

- [Setup a macOS Development Environment](docs/source/Install/installOnMacOS.rst)

- [Setup a Linux Development Environment](docs/source/Install/installOnLinux.rst)

- [Setup a Windows Development Environment](docs/source/Install/installOnWindows.rst)



### Basilisk Development guidelines

* [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [Coding Guidelines](docs/source/Support/Developer/CodingGuidlines.rst)


### Getting Started
To get started with Basilisk (BSK), several tutorial python files are provided in the installed package.  Within this
web page documentation site, they are listed and discussed in the [integrated example script](docs/source/examples/index.rst)
page.  The
documentation lists the scenarios in an order that facilitates learning basic BSK features. The python scripts
are stored under `basilisk/examples`. A good start would be to run `scenarioBasicOrbit.py`.

To play with the tutorials, it is suggested the user makes a copy of these tutorial files, and use the copies in order
to learn, test and experiment. Copy the folder `basilisk/examples` into a
new folder, and change to that directory.
To run the default scenario of `scenarioBasicOrbit`, in the directory of the
copied tutorials, execute the python script: `python scenarioBasicOrbit.py`

Now, when you want to use a tutorial, navigate inside that folder, and edit and execute the *copied* integrated tests.

Any new BSK module development should not occur within the BSK folder as this will be updated rapidly.  Rather,
new FSW algorithm or simulation code modules should be created in a custom folder outside of the BSK directory.
See the [building custom modules](docs/source/Install/buildExtModules.rst) web page
for more information.

To use the standalone 3D Visualization, download the [Vizard](docs/source/Vizard/VizardDownload.rst).
This is in development, but does provide a 3D view of many of the simulation states.


### Who do I talk to?

Questions and answers are fielded in the project's [Github Discussions](https://github.com/AVSLab/basilisk/discussions).
