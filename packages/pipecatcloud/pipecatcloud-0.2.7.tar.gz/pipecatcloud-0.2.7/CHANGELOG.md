# Pipecat Cloud Changelog

All notable changes to **Pipecat Cloud** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.7] - 2025-10-21

### Added

- Added a `stop` command to `pcc agent` that allows stopping an ongoing Pipecat
  Cloud session.

### Changed

- Fallback `RunnerArguments` now include a `body` field in the base class.

### Deprecated

- The `pcc init` command is now deprecated and will be removed in a future
  version. Use the [Pipecat CLI](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-cli)
  instead.

## [0.2.6] - 2025-10-09

### Added

- Added an optional `--profile` option to the `deploy` command which selects between
  `agent-1x`, with 0.5 vCPUs / 1 GB RAM, and `agent-2x`, with 1 vCPU / 2 GB RAM. The
  default profile is `agent-1x`.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `agent status` CLI command would return incorrect
  values for Min and Max Agents.

## [0.2.5] - 2025-10-02

### Added

- Added a `body` parameter to the fallback type, `WebsocketRunnerArguments`.

- Added `SmallWebRTCSessionManager`, a Session Manager to simplify bot creation
  in Pipecat Cloud using `SmallWebRTCTransport`.
- Added a `SmallWebRTCSessionArguments` dataclass.

- `deploy` command now accepts a `--enable-managed-keys` flag which enables
  properly configured agents to use Daily's API keys for supported upstream
  services. This can also be enabled via `pcc-deploy.toml` by adding the
  `enable_managed_keys` attribute and a boolean value.

- `agent status` now reflects the state of the managed keys feature.

## [0.2.4] - 2025-08-26

### Added

- Added `docker build-push` command for building, tagging, and pushing Docker
  images. Automatically parses registry information from the `image` field in
  `pcc-deploy.toml` and supports both Docker Hub and custom registries. Includes
  real-time build output and helpful authentication error hints.

### Changed

- `pcc init` now points to https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-quickstart.

## [0.2.3] - 2025-08-19

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where DailySessionArguments required positional args for
  `handle_sigint`, `handle_sigterm`, and `pipeline_idle_timeout_secs`.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-08-18

### Added

- Added `RunnerArguments` as a fallback type in the event that the Pipecat
  development runner is not imported.

### Changed

- Updated the `typer` dependency to support a range of versions in order to
  resolve conflicts with other packages. The new range supported is:
  `"typer>=0.15.3,<0.17.0"`.

- Relaxed the package requirements for `python-dotenv` and `uvicorn` to make it
  easier to work with Pipecat Cloud. The new supported versions are:

  - `"python-dotenv>=1.0.1,<2.0.0"`
  - `"uvicorn>=0.32.0,<1.0.0"`

- Updated all types to inherit from `RunnerArguments` to align the types with
  the Pipecat development runner types. This adds types:

  - `handle_sigint`
  - `handle_sigterm`
  - `pipeline_idle_timeout_secs`

### Fixed

- Fixed `ZeroDivisionError` in `agent sessions` command when calculating
  metrics for agents with zero sessions.

- Fixed `UnboundLocalError` in `agent sessions` command where
  `metric_renderables` was referenced before assignment due to earlier logic
  failures.

- `agent sessions` command previously threw `AttributeError` when no agent name
  was provided via command line or `pcc-deploy.toml`, it now exits gracefully
  with a clear error message.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-08-02

### Added

- Added a `pipecatcloud[pipecat]` extra for installing `pipecat-ai` dependency.

### Changed

- Session argument types now inherit from pipecat-ai runner types when available.
  `DailySessionArguments` and `WebSocketSessionArguments` now inherit from
  `pipecat.runner.types` when `pipecat-ai>=0.0.77` is installed to provide
  compatibility with the pipecat-ai development runner.

- Add clarifying information to the `pcc secrets image-pull-secret` setup.

- Modified the `aiohttp` minimum version to `3.11.12` and expanded `fastapi` to
  `>=0.115.6,<0.117.0` in order to align with `pipecat-ai`.

### Deprecated

- When `pipecat-ai` is not installed, session arguments fall back to standalone
  implementations. This fallback behavior is deprecated and will be removed in
  a future version. Install with `pip install pipecatcloud[pipecat]` for the
  preferred implementation.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-09

### Changed

- `deploy` command now requires valid image pull credentials (`--credentials`). Most repositories and use-cases require authorized image pulls, so this change aims to guide correct usage.
  - Deploying without credentials can be achieved with the `--no-credentials` / `-nc` or `--force` flags.
  - It is always recommend to provide a an image pull secret as part of your deployment.

## [0.1.8] - 2025-07-09

### Changed

- `deploy` command now shows a warning when image pull credentials are not provided.

### Added

- Add py.typed marker for static type checking support.

## [0.1.7] - 2025-06-12

### Added

- `agent sessions` command lists session history and various statistics (avg. start times, cold starts etc.)

- Bumped `typer` dependency to `0.15` to fix errors when using `--help` flag.

## [0.1.6] - 2025-04-25

### Changed

## [0.1.4] - 2025-03-28

### Changed

- `deploy` now shows a confirmation when `min-instances` is greater than 0 to assert usage will be billed.

### Fixed

- `auth login` now accepts a `--headless` / `-h` flag to skip automatic browser opening during authentication. This is particularly useful for:
  - Systems running in headless environments
  - WSL installations where browser context may not match the terminal
  - CI/CD pipelines
  - Users who prefer to manually copy and paste the authentication URL

## [0.1.3] - 2025-03-13

### Fixed

- `deploy` now correctly handles error states returned by the API

- `deploy` checks revision status vs. general service ready status (when updating)

### Added

  rooms when creating sessions.

  deployment.

- Added a `--format / -f` option for `agent logs`. Options are `TEXT` and
  `JSON`.
