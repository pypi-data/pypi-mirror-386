Through the vertices of a triangle $ABC$ are drawn three parallel lines, of
arbitrary direction, and the perpendiculars to these line through the same
vertices. Three rectangles are thus obtained of which the sides $BC$, $CA$,
$AB$ are diagonals, respectively. Prove that the three remaining diagonals
of these rectangles meet in a point on the nine-point circle of $ABC$.
