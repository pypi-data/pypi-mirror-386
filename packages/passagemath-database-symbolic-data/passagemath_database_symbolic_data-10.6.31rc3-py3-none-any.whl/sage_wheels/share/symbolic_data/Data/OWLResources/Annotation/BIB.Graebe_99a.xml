The paper [BIB/Graebe_99a] gives a report on some experiences with the
general purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) Axiom, Macsyma, Maple,
Mathematica, MuPAD, and Reduce solving systems of polynomial equations
and the way they present their solutions. This snapshot (taken in the
spring 1996) of the current power of the different systems in a
special area concentrates both on CPU-times and the quality of the
output.

It discusses the following examples:

Sym1_211 as Example 1
Katsura_3 as Example 3
Katsura_4 as Example 7
Sym1_311 as Example 4
Sym1_321 as Example 6
Cyclic_5 as Example 5
Cyclic_4 as Example 8 (with w as parameter)
Raksanyi as Example 9
Robot-Romin as Example 10 (with a,b,c,l2,l3 as parameters)
Krider as Example Kri
Gerdt-85 as Example G1
Gerdt-91b as Example G6
Gerdt-90 as Example G7
Gonnet-83_1 as Example Go
