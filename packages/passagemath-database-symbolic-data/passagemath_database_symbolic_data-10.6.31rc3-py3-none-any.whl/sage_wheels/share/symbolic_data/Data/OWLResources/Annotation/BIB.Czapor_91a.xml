The paper [BIB/Czapor_91a] discusses several lex. Groebner
heuristics. Normal selection is usually bad. Better pair selection
strategies order S-polynomials either by their degree or by their
expected degree.

It discusses the following examples:

Trinks as Problem 1
Katsura_5 as Problem 2
Czapor-87_2 as Problem 3
Butcher as Problem 5
Hairer_2 as Problem 6
Hairer_2_1 as Problem 6
Cyclic_5 as Problem 7
Cyclic_7_1 as Problem 8
Caprasse as Problem 9
Fee_3 as Problem 10
Katsura_6 as Problem 11
Cyclic_5_1 as Problem 13
Cyclic_6 as Problem 14
