  <note>

The paper [BIB/Gerdt_92a] contains a description of the authors'
Reduce package ASYS, that solves polynomial systems via Groebner
methods and homogeneity analysis.  Homogeneity analysis detects torus
actions on the system to reduce the number of variables. Applies these
techniques to solve polynomial equations coming from diff. equations.
Comparison with AlPi and Felix. It discusses the following examples:

Gerdt-85 as example 1
Gerdt-91b as example 2
Gerdt-90 as example 3
Cyclic_5 as example 4
Cyclic_5_1 as example 5
