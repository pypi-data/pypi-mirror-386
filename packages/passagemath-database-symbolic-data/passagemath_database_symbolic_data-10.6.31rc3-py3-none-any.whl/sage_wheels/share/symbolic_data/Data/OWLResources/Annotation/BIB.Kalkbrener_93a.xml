The paper [BIB/Kalkbrener_93a] discusses solving polynomial systems by
computing regular chains, i.e.. such triangular systems
$(f_1,...,f_k)$ where $lc(f_i)(a_1,...,a_j)\neq 0$ on all zeroes
$(a_1,...,a_j)\in Z(f_1,...f_{i-1})$.  Employs a mixture between
pseudo division and the D5 technique.

It discusses the following examples:

Cyclic_4 as 3.1.
Trinks as (1)
Katsura_5 as (2)
Rose as (3)
Czapor-86a as (4)
Fee_1 as (5a)
Fee_2 as (5b)
Fee_3 as (5c)
Czapor-86b as (6)
Czapor-86c_1 as (7a)
Czapor-86c_2 as (7b)
Czapor-86c as (7c)
