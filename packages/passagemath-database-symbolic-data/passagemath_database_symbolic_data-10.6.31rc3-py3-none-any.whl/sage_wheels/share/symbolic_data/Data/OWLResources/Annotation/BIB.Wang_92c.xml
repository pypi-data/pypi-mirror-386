The paper [BIB/Wang_92c] discusses several strategies to speed up the
computation of characteristic series using weakened versions of basic
sets: top reduced, full reduced, quasi-basic sets. Best results are
reproted with weak basic sets. Examples:

Wu-90 as Problem 3
Fee_2 as Example 17
TD-89 as Problem 29
Vermeer as Example 47
Discriminant_5 as Problem 50
