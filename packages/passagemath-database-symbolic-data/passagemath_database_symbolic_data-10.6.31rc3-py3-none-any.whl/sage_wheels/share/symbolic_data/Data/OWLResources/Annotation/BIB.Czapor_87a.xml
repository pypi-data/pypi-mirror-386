The paper [BIB/Czapor_87a] discusses Groebner basis computations under
different heuristics. Remark that tail reduction for lex Groebner
bases may be prohibitive. Some remarks on the Groebner factorizer.

It contains the following examples:

Butcher as Problem 2
Fee_3 as Problem 3
Czapor-87 as Problem 4
Czapor-87_1 as Problem 4a
Czapor-87_2 as Problem 4b
Trinks as Problem 5
Katsura_5 as Problem 6
Rose as Problem 7
