  <note>

The paper [BIB/Wang_92a] gives a comparison of different methods for
polynomial systems decomposition.  The focus is on characteristic sets
with (algebraic) factorization, that yields an irreducible
decomposition. Ideal bases of these components may be reconstructed
via ideal quotient computations.  Run time comparisons on 20 examples.

It discusses the following examples:

Neff-89 as Example 2
Wang-89 as Example 3
Wang-92a as Example 4
FourCircles as Example 5
Discriminant_4 as Example 6
Bronstein-86 as Example 7
Robot-RR as Example 8
Wang-92c as Example 9
Discriminant_5 as Example 10
Geometry.Brahmagupta as Example 11
Butcher as Example 12
Wang-92e as Example 13
Wang-92f as Example 14
Hairer_2 as Example 15
Wu-90 as Problem 16
