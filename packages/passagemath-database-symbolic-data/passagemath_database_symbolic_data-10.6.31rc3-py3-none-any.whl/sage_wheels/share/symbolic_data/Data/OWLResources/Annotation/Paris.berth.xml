 I have a lot of elimination problems, tried Singular on one of them --
 10 days computing time, 500 MB memory and no result so far.
 
 The problems are of the form
 
 p_1^n_1 A + p_2^n_2 = 0
 p_3^n_3 B + p_4^n_4 = 0
  etc.
 
 where the p_i are polynomials in x_1...x_n and one wants to eliminate
 the x_i to get a relation between A, B etc. (I just thought you might be
 interested in challenging problems, solving  problems of the above class
 would have some effect on solving ordinary differential equations).</note>
