[Happy Eyeball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs)
([RFC 8305](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8305.html))

## Use case

This library exists to allow connecting with
[Happy Eyeball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs)
([RFC 8305](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8305.html))
when you
already have a list of addrinfo and not a DNS name.

The stdlib version of `loop.create_connection()`
will only work when you pass in an unresolved name which
is not a good fit when using DNS caching or resolving
names via another method such as `zeroconf`.

## Installation

Install this via pip (or your favourite package manager):

`pip install aiohappyeyeball`

## License

## Example usage

```python

addr_infos = await loop.getaddrinfo("example.org", 80)

socket = await start_connection(addr_infos)
socket = await start_connection(addr_infos, local_addr_infos=local_addr_infos, happy_eyeballs_delay=0.2)

transport, protocol = await loop.create_connection(
    MyProtocol, sock=socket, ...)

# Remove the first address for each family from addr_info
pop_addr_infos_interleave(addr_info, 1)

# Remove all matching address from addr_info
remove_addr_infos(addr_info, "dead::beef::")

# Convert a local_addr to local_addr_infos
local_addr_infos = addr_to_addr_infos(("127.0.0.1",0))
```
