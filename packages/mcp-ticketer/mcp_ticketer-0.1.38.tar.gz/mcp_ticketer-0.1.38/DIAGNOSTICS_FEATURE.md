# 🔍 MCP Ticketer Diagnostics & Self-Diagnosis System

**Version**: 0.1.28+  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & DEPLOYED**  
**Date**: 2025-10-24

## 🎯 Overview

The MCP Ticketer diagnostics system provides comprehensive health monitoring and self-diagnosis capabilities for both users and AI agents. This addresses the critical need for system visibility when troubleshooting issues like the "60% queue failure rate" problem.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. **CLI Health Commands**

#### Quick Health Check
```bash
mcp-ticketer health
```

**Output Example:**
```
🏥 MCP Ticketer Quick Health Check
==================================================
✅ Python: 3.13.7
✅ Configuration: Found .aitrackdown
✅ Aitrackdown: Directory exists at .aitrackdown
ℹ️  Aitrackdown: 46 tickets found
✅ Environment: 2 adapter variables configured
  • LINEAR_API_KEY
  • GITHUB_TOKEN
✅ Installation: mcp-ticketer 0.1.28 installed
⚠️  Queue System: Could not check status - import error

🎉 System appears healthy!
💡 For detailed diagnosis, run: mcp-ticketer diagnose
```

#### Comprehensive Diagnosis
```bash
mcp-ticketer diagnose                    # Full diagnosis
mcp-ticketer diagnose --simple           # Simple diagnosis (no heavy dependencies)
mcp-ticketer diagnose --output report.json  # Save to file
mcp-ticketer diagnose --json             # JSON output
```

**Output Example:**
```
🔍 MCP Ticketer Simple Diagnosis
============================================================

📋 Basic System Check
✅ Python 3.13.7
✅ mcp-ticketer 0.1.28 installed

📋 Configuration Check
ℹ️  No configuration files (using defaults)
✅ 2 adapter environment variables configured

============================================================
📋 DIAGNOSIS SUMMARY
============================================================

💡 Recommendations:
  ✅ System appears healthy
```

### 2. **MCP Diagnostic Tools**

Two new MCP tools are available for AI agents:

#### `system_health`
- **Purpose**: Quick system health check
- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: Configuration status, queue worker status, failure rates
- **Use Case**: AI agents can quickly check if the system is operational

#### `system_diagnose`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive system diagnostics
- **Parameters**: 
  - `include_logs` (boolean, optional): Include recent log analysis
- **Returns**: Detailed analysis of all components with recommendations
- **Use Case**: Deep troubleshooting when issues are detected

### 3. **Intelligent Fallback System**

The diagnostics system includes multiple fallback mechanisms:

1. **Simple Health Check**: Works without heavy dependencies (PyYAML, etc.)
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to simple diagnostics if full system fails
3. **Import Protection**: Handles missing dependencies gracefully
4. **Error Recovery**: Continues diagnosis even if individual components fail

## 🔄 Exit Codes

The diagnostic commands use standard exit codes for automation:

- **0**: System healthy, no issues detected
- **1**: Critical issues found, immediate attention required
- **2**: Warnings detected, monitoring recommended

## 🎉 Impact on Original Issue

This diagnostics system directly addresses the original problem:

> "The mcp-ticketer system itself is experiencing critical issues! This is actually very revealing - the ticketing system has a 60% failure rate"

### Before Diagnostics
- ❌ No visibility into system health
- ❌ No way to identify root causes
- ❌ Manual investigation required
- ❌ AI agents couldn't self-diagnose

### After Diagnostics
- ✅ **Instant system health visibility**
- ✅ **Automated issue detection**
- ✅ **AI agent self-diagnosis capability**
- ✅ **Actionable recommendations**
- ✅ **Proactive monitoring**

### Example Diagnostic Output for Queue Issues
```
❌ Queue Health: High failure rate 60.0% (12/20)
❌ Queue Worker: Not running

💡 Recommendations:
• Restart queue worker: mcp-ticketer queue worker restart
• Check queue system logs for error patterns
• Consider clearing failed queue items: mcp-ticketer queue clear --failed
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

1. **Metrics Dashboard**: Web-based health monitoring
2. **Alert Integration**: Slack/email notifications for critical issues
3. **Historical Tracking**: Trend analysis and performance history
4. **Auto-Remediation**: Automated fixing of common issues
5. **Custom Health Checks**: User-defined diagnostic rules
