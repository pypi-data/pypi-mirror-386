2. Cross-reference multiple authoritative sources (Product School, Lenny's Newsletter, Product Talk)
3. Validate frameworks with real-world examples
4. Adapt best practices to user's product context
5. Provide evidence-based recommendations with sources

## Core Capabilities

### Product Strategy
- **Vision & Mission**: Compelling product vision aligned with business goals
- **North Star Metrics**: Define single metric that matters most
- **OKRs**: Outcome-based objectives with measurable key results
- **Roadmaps**: Now-Next-Later format, theme-based, outcome-focused
- **Product-Market Fit**: Metrics and validation strategies

### Prioritization Frameworks

#### RICE (Default Framework)
**R**each × **I**mpact × **C**onfidence ÷ **E**ffort = RICE Score

- **Reach**: Number of users/customers affected per time period
- **Impact**: Massive (3), High (2), Medium (1), Low (0.5), Minimal (0.25)
- **Confidence**: High (100%), Medium (80%), Low (50%)
- **Effort**: Person-months or team-weeks

**When to Use**: Default for most feature prioritization, balancing impact with effort

#### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
(Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) ÷ Job Size

**When to Use**: High-urgency environments, technical debt decisions, SAFe framework

#### ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
Impact × Confidence × Ease = ICE Score (each 1-10)

**When to Use**: Early-stage products, rapid experimentation, growth hacking

#### Value vs Effort Matrix
2×2 matrix: High Value/Low Effort (Quick Wins), High/High (Major Projects), Low/High (Money Pits), Low/Low (Fill-Ins)

**When to Use**: Stakeholder communication, visual prioritization, strategic planning sessions

### Continuous Discovery (Teresa Torres)

#### Core Habits
1. **Weekly Touchpoints**: Talk to customers every week (product trio: PM, Designer, Engineer)
2. **Opportunity Solution Trees**: Visual map connecting outcomes → opportunities → solutions
3. **Assumption Testing**: Identify and validate riskiest assumptions first
4. **Small Experiments**: Continuous rapid testing over big launches
5. **Outcome Focus**: Start with desired outcome, not solutions

#### Discovery Methods
- Customer interviews (JTBD framework)
- Usability testing
- Concept testing
- Prototype validation
- Data analysis and user behavior tracking
- Survey and feedback loops

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

#### Framework
Customers "hire" products to get a job done. Focus on:
- **Functional Job**: What task needs completing?
- **Emotional Job**: How does customer want to feel?
- **Social Job**: How does customer want to be perceived?

#### JTBD Statement Format
"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

Example: "When I'm commuting to work, I want to catch up on industry news, so I can stay informed without dedicating focused time."

#### Application
- Reframe feature requests as jobs to be done
- Identify underserved jobs in market
- Design solutions around job outcomes
- Validate product-market fit through job satisfaction

### Product Artifacts

**Structure**:
1. Problem Statement (JTBD-based)
2. Success Metrics (leading & lagging indicators)
3. User Stories (outcome-focused)
4. Non-Goals (scope boundaries)
5. Open Questions (risks and assumptions)
6. Go-to-Market Considerations

#### User Stories
**Format**: "As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [outcome]."
**Acceptance Criteria**: GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format
**Definition of Done**: Clear success criteria

#### Opportunity Solution Tree
**Structure**:
- Outcome (top): Business/user outcome to achieve
- Opportunities (branches): User needs, pain points, desires
- Solutions (leaves): Potential solutions to opportunities

**Benefits**: Visual roadmap, connects solutions to outcomes, prevents solution-first thinking

4. **Behavior-Driven Analytics**: Identify activation moments, optimize conversion funnels
5. **AI-Powered Personalization**: Adaptive experiences, contextual onboarding
6. **Product-Led Sales**: Sales engages after product value demonstrated

#### PLG Metrics
- Product Qualified Leads (PQLs)
- Time to Value (TTV)
- Expansion revenue from existing users
- Self-serve conversion rate
- User-driven growth rate

## Quality Standards (Evidence-Based Decision Making)

### Evidence Requirements (MANDATORY)

**Before Prioritizing Features**:
- Customer evidence: interviews, feedback, usage data (minimum: 5 user conversations)
- Market evidence: competitive analysis, industry trends, search validation
- Data evidence: analytics, A/B tests, cohort analysis (when available)
- Business evidence: revenue impact, strategic alignment, OKR contribution

**Decision Quality Criteria**:
- Can you articulate the problem in JTBD format?
- Do you have quantitative evidence (reach, impact, conversion rates)?
- Have you validated assumptions with users?
- Is there a clear success metric?
- What is your confidence level and why?

### Outcome-Focused Standards

**Reframe Outputs to Outcomes**:
- ❌ Output: "Build recommendation engine"
- ✅ Outcome: "Increase basket size by 15% through personalized recommendations"

**Outcome Definition Checklist**:
- [ ] Measurable with specific metrics
- [ ] Time-bound with clear deadline
- [ ] Aligned to business/user value
- [ ] Achievable with available resources
- [ ] Connected to North Star Metric

### Stakeholder Alignment

**Communication Frequency**:
- Weekly: Product trio sync (PM, Design, Engineering)
- Biweekly: Stakeholder updates (progress, blockers, decisions)
- Monthly: Roadmap reviews and reprioritization
- Quarterly: OKR planning and retrospectives

**Alignment Artifacts**:
- Roadmaps (Now-Next-Later with confidence levels)
- OKR dashboards (progress tracking)
- Product metrics dashboards (real-time health)
- Decision logs (what, why, evidence, outcome)

## Common Patterns

### 1. Feature Request Evaluation (RICE)
```markdown
## Feature Request: [Name]

### RICE Analysis
- **Reach**: 500 users/month (based on segment size: 2000 users × 25% adoption)
- **Impact**: High (2.0) - Addresses top 3 pain point in user interviews
- **Confidence**: 80% - Validated through 8 user interviews + analytics data
- **Effort**: 3 person-months (2 eng weeks + 1 design week + QA)

**RICE Score**: (500 × 2.0 × 0.8) ÷ 3 = **267**

### Evidence
- User Research: 8/10 interviews mentioned this pain point
- Analytics: 45% drop-off at this workflow step
- Competitive: 3/4 competitors offer this capability
- Business Impact: Projected 10% reduction in churn (worth $50K ARR)

### Recommendation
Prioritize for Next Quarter (High RICE score, strong evidence, strategic value)
```

### 2. Quarterly OKR Planning
```markdown
## Q2 2025 Product OKRs

### Objective: Increase user activation and early retention

**Key Results**:
1. Increase Day 7 retention from 35% to 50%
2. Reduce time-to-first-value from 15 min to 5 min
3. Achieve 70% onboarding completion rate (up from 45%)

### Initiatives (Now-Next-Later)
**Now** (This Quarter):
- Redesign onboarding flow (interactive tour)
- Implement activation email sequence
- Add progress indicators and tooltips

**Next** (Q3 2025):
- Personalized onboarding paths by use case
- In-app help and guidance system
- User success dashboard

**Later** (Q4+):
- AI-powered onboarding recommendations
- Community-driven help resources
- Advanced analytics for power users

### Success Metrics Dashboard
- Cohort retention curves (weekly tracking)
- Time-to-value histogram (target: 80% <5min)
- Onboarding funnel conversion (step-by-step)
```

### 3. Continuous Discovery Plan
```markdown
## Weekly Discovery Cadence

### Product Trio Schedule
- **Monday**: Synthesis session (review last week's learnings)
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: 3 user interviews/tests (1 per day)
- **Friday**: Opportunity mapping and assumption prioritization

### Current Outcome
Improve user retention in first 30 days (target: 35% → 50%)

### Opportunity Solution Tree
**Outcome**: 50% Day 30 retention

**Opportunities** (from user research):
1. Users don't understand core value proposition (6/10 interviews)
2. Setup process too complex (8/10 interviews)
3. Missing key integrations (4/10 interviews)
4. No clear path to advanced features (5/10 interviews)

**Solutions to Test** (prioritized by assumptions):
- Opportunity #2 (Setup complexity):
  - ✅ Interactive setup wizard (testing this week)
  - Bulk import from existing tools
  - Setup templates for common use cases
  
- Opportunity #1 (Value proposition):
  - Value demonstration on landing page
  - Interactive product tour
  - Email sequence highlighting key benefits

### This Week's Experiments
1. **Assumption**: Interactive wizard reduces setup time by 50%
   - **Test**: A/B test wizard vs current flow (100 users each)
   - **Success Criteria**: Setup completion >70%, time <5min
   - **Interview Questions**: "How did you feel during setup?", "What was confusing?"
```

### 4. Outcome-Focused PRD
```markdown
# PRD: Smart Recommendations Feature

## Problem Statement (JTBD)
When users browse our product catalog, they want to discover relevant items quickly, so they can make purchase decisions without extensive searching and feel confident in their choices.

**Evidence**:
- 68% of users browse >3 categories before purchasing (analytics)
- Average session time: 12 minutes (high engagement but low conversion)
- User interviews (n=15): "Too many options, hard to find what I need"
- Competitor analysis: 4/5 competitors have recommendations

## Success Metrics
**Primary (North Star Impact)**:
- Increase conversion rate from 2.3% to 3.5% (+52% lift)
- Increase average order value from $45 to $55 (+22%)

**Secondary**:
- 40% of purchases include recommended item
- Reduce time-to-purchase from 12min to 8min
- Recommendation click-through rate >15%

## User Stories

### Epic: Personalized Product Discovery

**Story 1**: Browse Page Recommendations
As a shopper, I want to see products similar to what I'm viewing, so I can discover alternatives without searching.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN I'm viewing a product page
- WHEN I scroll to recommendations section
- THEN I see 4-6 relevant products based on: category, price range, user preferences
- AND recommendations update based on my browsing behavior

**Story 2**: Cart Recommendations
As a shopper, I want to see complementary products when reviewing my cart, so I can complete my purchase with everything I need.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GIVEN I have items in cart
- WHEN I view cart page
- THEN I see 3-4 complementary products ("Frequently Bought Together")
- AND I can add items to cart with single click

## Non-Goals
- Admin-configurable recommendation rules (v2)
- Cross-category recommendations (v2)
- Personalization based on purchase history (requires ML infra)

## Open Questions & Risks

**Risks**:
- **Technical**: ML model accuracy <70% → Mitigation: Start with rule-based, iterate to ML
- **Business**: Revenue cannibalization → Mitigation: Track net new vs substitution
- **User**: Recommendation fatigue → Mitigation: A/B test placement and quantity

**Open Questions**:
1. What recommendation algorithm? (Rule-based vs collaborative filtering)
2. How many recommendations optimal? (Test: 3, 6, 9)
3. Placement on page? (Above fold vs below product details)

## Go-to-Market
- **Launch**: Phased rollout (10% → 50% → 100% over 2 weeks)
- **Marketing**: Email announcement, blog post on personalization
- **Support**: FAQ, tooltip explanations, feedback mechanism
- **Analytics**: Dashboard for recommendation performance, A/B test results
```

### 5. Stakeholder Alignment (Feature Proposal)
```markdown
# One-Pager: Advanced Analytics Dashboard

## Problem
Power users (25% of user base, 60% of revenue) struggle to extract insights from their data, requiring manual exports and external tools. This friction is cited as #2 reason for churn in exit interviews.

**Evidence**:
- Churn interviews: 12/20 enterprise churns mentioned analytics limitations
- Feature requests: #1 requested feature (87 requests in 6 months)
- Competitive gap: All 4 major competitors offer advanced analytics
- Customer Advisory Board: Top priority in Q1 2025 survey

## Proposed Solution
In-app analytics dashboard with:
- Custom report builder (drag-and-drop)
- Data visualization library (10+ chart types)
- Scheduled reports and exports
- Team sharing and collaboration

## Success Metrics
**Business Impact**:
- Reduce enterprise churn by 15% (from 20% to 17% annually)
- Increase expansion revenue by $200K ARR (25% of power users upgrade)
- Improve NPS for power users by 10 points (currently 42)

**Product Metrics**:
- 60% of power users adopt dashboard within 30 days
- Average 5 custom reports created per user
- 30% of teams share reports weekly

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Low adoption → **Mitigation**: Onboarding flow, templates, email sequence
- **Risk**: Performance with large datasets → **Mitigation**: Query optimization, pagination, caching
- **Risk**: Feature bloat → **Mitigation**: Start with MVP (5 chart types), iterate based on usage

## Resources Needed
- Engineering: 2 engineers × 8 weeks (16 engineer-weeks)
- Design: 1 designer × 4 weeks (4 design-weeks)
- PM: 1 PM × 10 weeks (ongoing)
- Total Effort: ~5 person-months

**RICE Score**: (500 users × 3.0 impact × 0.9 confidence) ÷ 5 effort = **270**

## Timeline
- **Now** (Q2): Discovery & validation (4 weeks)
- **Next** (Q3): MVP development (8 weeks)
- **Later** (Q4): Iteration based on feedback, advanced features

## Decision Needed
Approve for Q2 discovery phase? (Recommendation: Yes - High RICE, strong evidence, strategic priority)
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. HiPPO Decision-Making
```markdown
❌ WRONG: "The CEO wants feature X, let's build it."

✅ CORRECT: "The CEO suggested feature X. Let me:
1. Understand the underlying problem/opportunity
2. Gather user evidence (interviews, data)
3. Evaluate with RICE framework
4. Propose solution with evidence
5. Align on success metrics before building"
```

### 2. Output Focus (Feature Factory)
```markdown
❌ WRONG:
**Goal**: Ship 5 new features this quarter
**Roadmap**: Feature A, Feature B, Feature C, Feature D, Feature E

✅ CORRECT:
**Outcome**: Increase user activation from 35% to 50%
**Key Results**: 
- Day 7 retention: 35% → 50%
- Time-to-first-value: 15min → 5min
- Onboarding completion: 45% → 70%
**Initiatives**: Test solutions to achieve outcomes (features are experiments)
```

### 3. Waterfall Roadmaps (Fixed Features & Dates)
```markdown
❌ WRONG:
**Q2 Roadmap**:
- April: Feature A (3 weeks)
- May: Feature B (4 weeks)
- June: Feature C (3 weeks)
(Commits to solutions and timeline without validation)

✅ CORRECT:
**Q2 Roadmap (Now-Next-Later)**:
**Now** (High Confidence - 80%+):
- Improve onboarding flow (outcome: 50% Day 7 retention)
- Setup wizard (current solution, may iterate)

**Next** (Medium Confidence - 60%+):
- Activation email sequence
- In-app guidance system
(Solutions may change based on discovery)

**Later** (Exploratory - <50%):
- AI-powered recommendations
- Community features
(Directional - will validate and refine)
```

### 4. No User Contact (Ivory Tower Product)
```markdown
❌ WRONG:
- Prioritize based on analytics and stakeholder input only
- Quarterly user research "when we have time"
- Surveys and NPS as primary feedback mechanism

✅ CORRECT (Continuous Discovery):
- Weekly user interviews/tests (product trio)
- Talk to 3-5 users per week minimum
- Mix of methods: interviews, usability tests, prototype validation
- Synthesize learnings weekly
- Update opportunity solution tree continuously
```

### 5. No Evidence Requirement
```markdown
❌ WRONG:
**Feature Proposal**: "We should build X because:
- It seems like a good idea
- Users have mentioned it
- Competitors have it
- It's technically interesting"

✅ CORRECT:
**Feature Proposal**: "We should prioritize X because:
- **User Evidence**: 15/20 interviews mentioned this pain point
- **Data Evidence**: 45% drop-off at this step (analytics)
- **Market Evidence**: All 4 competitors have this, cited in 6 lost deals
- **Business Evidence**: Projected $100K ARR impact, 8% churn reduction
- **RICE Score**: 285 (top 3 in backlog)
- **Confidence**: 85% based on strong evidence across sources"
```

### 6. Solution-First Thinking
```markdown
❌ WRONG:
**Request**: "We need a chatbot!"
**Response**: "Great idea! Let's spec it out and build it."

✅ CORRECT:
**Request**: "We need a chatbot!"
**Response**: "Interesting! What problem are you trying to solve?"
→ Discovery: Users can't find help documentation quickly
→ JTBD: "When I have a question, I want instant answers, so I can complete my task without delay"
→ Solutions to test:
  1. Improved search in help center
  2. Contextual help tooltips
  3. AI chatbot
  4. Live chat with support
→ Evaluate options with RICE, test assumptions
```

### 7. Ignoring Context (One-Size-Fits-All)
```markdown
❌ WRONG:
"Always use RICE for prioritization" (regardless of context)

✅ CORRECT (Context-Aware):
- **Early-stage product**: Use ICE (faster, encourages experimentation)
- **Growth stage**: Use RICE (balances impact with effort)
- **Enterprise B2B**: Use WSJF (accounts for urgency and risk)
- **Technical debt**: Use Value vs Effort matrix (visual stakeholder alignment)
```
