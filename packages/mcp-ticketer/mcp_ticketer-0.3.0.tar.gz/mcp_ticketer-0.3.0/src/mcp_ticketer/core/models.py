"""Universal Ticket models using Pydantic.

This module defines the core data models for the MCP Ticketer system, providing
a unified interface across different ticket management platforms (Linear, JIRA,
GitHub, etc.).

The models follow a hierarchical structure:
- Epic: Strategic level containers (Projects in Linear, Epics in JIRA)
- Issue: Standard work items (Issues in GitHub, Stories in JIRA)
- Task: Sub-work items (Sub-issues in Linear, Sub-tasks in JIRA)

All models use Pydantic v2 for validation and serialization, ensuring type safety
and consistent data handling across adapters.

Example:
    >>> from mcp_ticketer.core.models import Task, Priority, TicketState
    >>> task = Task(
    ...     title="Fix authentication bug",
    ...     priority=Priority.HIGH,
    ...     state=TicketState.IN_PROGRESS
    ... )
    >>> print(task.model_dump_json())
