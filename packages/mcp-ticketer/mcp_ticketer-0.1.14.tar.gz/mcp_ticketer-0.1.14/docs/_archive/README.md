# Documentation Archives

This directory contains archived versions of project documentation files.

## Archive Naming Convention

Files are archived with timestamps:
- `CLAUDE.md.2024-01-15T10-30-45.md` - Regular archive
- `CLAUDE.md.2024-01-15T10-30-45.md.gz` - Compressed archive (older than 7 days)

## Archive Management

- Archives are created automatically when documentation is updated
- Older archives are compressed after 7 days
- Archives older than 90 days are automatically deleted
- Maximum of 10 archives kept per file

## Restoration

To restore an archived file:
1. Find the desired version by timestamp
2. Copy it back to the project root
3. Rename to remove the timestamp
