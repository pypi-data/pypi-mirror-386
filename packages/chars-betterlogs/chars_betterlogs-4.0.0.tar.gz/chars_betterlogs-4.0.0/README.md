# Char's Better Logs

A project started to fix a problem I was having with the default python logging library

## USAGE

Simply install it with `pip install chars-betterlogs` and add it to your code with:
```python
from chars_betterlogs.logs import Logging
```

then make a variable:
```python
#                         The Filename         String to add before the log        Whether to print the log (Defaults to True)
logger:Logging = Logging('filename.log', 'This gets added before the log starts!', False)
```

Tada you now have a callable logger!

### Example Script
```python
from chars_betterlogs.logs import Logging
from datetime import datetime

logger:Logging = Logging('log_' + str(datetime.today().strftime('%d_%m_%Y-%H_%M_%S')) + '.log')

logging.log_info('yipee!')
logging.close() # Don't forget to end the log file before the script ends!
```
