"""
Non-Local Means Denoising Implementation using torch_nlm

This module provides OpenHCS-decorated wrapper functions for the torch_nlm library,
which implements memory-efficient non-local means denoising with GPU acceleration.

Non-local means is an advanced denoising algorithm that preserves fine details
and textures by comparing patches across the entire image rather than just
local neighborhoods. The torch_nlm implementation provides significant speedup
over traditional CPU implementations, especially for large 3D volumes.

Doctrinal Clauses:
- Clause 3 — Declarative Primacy: All functions are pure and stateless
- Clause 65 — Fail Loudly: No silent fallbacks or inferred capabilities
- Clause 88 — No Inferred Capabilities: Explicit PyTorch and torch_nlm dependency
- Clause 273 — Memory Backend Restrictions: GPU-only implementation

    Apply Non-Local Means denoising to a 3D image stack using torch_nlm.

    Non-Local Means is an advanced denoising algorithm that preserves fine details
    and textures by comparing patches across the entire image rather than just
    local neighborhoods. This implementation uses torch_nlm for GPU acceleration.

    Args:
        image: 3D PyTorch tensor of shape (Z, Y, X)
        kernel_size: Size of the neighborhood for patch comparison (default: 11)
        std: Standard deviation for weight calculation (default: 1.0)
        kernel_size_mean: Kernel size for initial mean filtering (default: 3)
        sub_filter_size: Number of neighborhoods computed per iteration for memory efficiency (default: 32)
        slice_by_slice: Process each Z-slice independently using 2D NLM (default: True).
                       If False, uses 3D NLM processing across all dimensions.
        **kwargs: Additional arguments (ignored for compatibility)

    Returns:
        Denoised 3D PyTorch tensor of shape (Z, Y, X)

    Raises:
        ImportError: If torch_nlm is not available
        TypeError: If input is not a torch.Tensor
        ValueError: If input is not 3D
        RuntimeError: If tensor is not on CUDA device

    Additional OpenHCS Parameters
    -----------------------------
    slice_by_slice : bool, optional (default: True)
        If True, process 3D arrays slice-by-slice using 2D non-local means to avoid
        cross-slice contamination. If False, use 3D non-local means processing.
        Recommended for stitched microscopy data to prevent artifacts at field boundaries.
