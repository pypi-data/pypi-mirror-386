	abstract = {Mathematical expressions for the secondary emission yield as a function of impact voltage and direction are required by computer programs for ray tracing, and are intended to follow secondary trajectories also. It is shown that the accuracy requirements are quite severe for lower voltage impacts, up to about three times V\_max (where V\_max is the voltage at which the normal secondary emission ratio reaches its maximum value delta\_max), but are less stringent above this range. A new formula is proposed for the low-voltage region, which agrees with experimental data better than the Lye and Dekker formula. For the voltage region above 4 V\_max, the Lye and Dekker formula is retained, with a smooth transition centered between 3 and 4 V\_max. The directional effect is modeled by adjusting the values of delta\_max and V\_max before applying either formula, rather than applying either Bruinings or Mullers correction factor afterward. This results in an automatic modeling of the known absence of any appreciable directional effect below about half V\_max. Some experimental verification of the formula used to modify delta\_max is presented.},

	abstract = {Radio-frequency (RF) systems used in vacuum can be damaged by electronic avalanches triggered by the multipactor effect. This undesirable phenomenon can appear for RF components used in space communication payloads as well as in experimental fusion devices, among others. To determine the multipactor breakdown threshold, expensive multipactor experimental tests can be made or multipactor simulations can be performed. This second method uses the Total Electron Emission Yield (TEEY) curve as input and the breakdown threshold predicted by simulation highly depends on this curve. Consequently we decided to make a sensitivity study of multipactor breakdown threshold in relation to the TEEY curve variations. We study the silver conductor material with a RF waveguide transformer. Two critical energy regions are found for a small gap waveguide structure: energies around first cross-over energy and energies between the first cross-over and the yield maximum. Electron emission data have to be accurate on these regions to get a coherent multipactor threshold. Six TEEY models are benchmarked with respect to their capability to accurately model these regions.},

In particular. the results strongly suggest that the first crossover energy can be very dependent on surface properties, whereas the energy at maximum yield is entirely controlled by bulk properties. Refinement of the low-energy part of the reduced yield curve by means of the results of the more realistic three- dimensional theory leads to the development of the expression E{\textasciitilde}, = O.51Eom8m - 132. Comparison between theory and experiment for several secondary-emitting materials is presented to demonstrate the accuracy of this useful relation. Finally. the implications of these results for different classes of materials are discussed in terms of basic physical properties. such as density, electrical conductivity, work function. and band gap.},

	abstract = {The development of analytical techniques based on measurements of electron elastic-backscattering probabilities stimulated an interest in the theoretical description of such phenomena. The most accurate and reliable theoretical models involve Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of electron trajectories in solids; however, this approach generally requires considerable computer effort. It has been shown that the performance of a modified analytical theory originally proposed by Oswald et al (1993 J. Electron Spectrosc. Relat. Phenom. 61 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0368-2048(93)80019-I] 251 ), designated with the acronym OKGM, compares reasonably well with MC calculations. The MC data are usually underestimated by the OKGM model, and the mean percentage deviation, averaged over nine elements and five energies up to 5 keV, is equal to 8.8{\textbackslash}\% for typical experimental configurations. However, the agreement between ratios of backscattering probabilities from MC simulations and the OKGM model agree much better due to the fact that underestimation of backscattering probability by the OMGM theory is partially cancelled. The percentage deviation between ratios from these theoretical models decreases to 3.14{\textbackslash}\%. The OKGM model should then be useful for determining inelastic mean free paths (IMFPs) from measured elastic-peak intensities. The accuracy of the obtained IMFPs is comparable with IMFPs from MC simulations.},

	abstract = {The multipactor phenomenon is characterized by a very fast growth of the electronic population in radio-frequency (RF) devices under vacuum. As this effect limits the transmissible RF power and can harm RF systems, it has been widely studied during the last few decades. Due to the high cost of experimental tests, simulation tools are heavily used to predict the threshold of multipactor growth. However, their reliability is limited for complex configurations, e.g., when dielectrics or magnetic fields are present. A crucial element of these multipactor simulations is the secondary-emission model. Dionne's model is able to model both metals and dielectrics secondary emission but is one-dimension only. As the three-dimensional aspect is essential for complex configurations, the Dionne model is extended to three-dimensions. Measurements of the total electron emission yield have been carried out at the ONERA and show a good agreement for low-impact energy and low-impact angle electrons, which is relevant in multipactor simulations.},
