# The TEEY measurements were performed in Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) facility designed to the study of electron emission.
# A dry turbo-molecular pump associated with an oil-free primary pump allows the system to be maintained at a vacuum
# level down to 3e-9 millibar. The sample holder allows the variation of the electron incidence angle from 0° (normal
# incidence angle) to 80°. An ELG-2022B electron gun from Kimball Instrument was used. The electron beam was pulsed
# during TEEY measurements to limit the surface conditioning effect. The facility is equipped with a Faraday cup, a
# hemispherical electron energy analyser and a X-ray Mgkalpha source. The sample holder and the collector can be
# independently biased to choose the desired potential. The sample holder is ordinarily negatively biased in order to
# prevent the low energy emitted electron to come back to the sample surface and prevent the generation of tertiary
# electrons.
#
# This file contains the measured TEEY of a copper sample (Cu #1) heated in situ under UHV at 200°C for 2 hours and
# eroded in situ under 1 keV Ar flux at normal incidence for 3 hours.
# XPS study showed that after the heating, the sample was contaminated, mainly with oxygen and carbon; after the
# erosion, it was almost pure.
#
# First line is incidence angle in degrees.
# First column is incident energy in eV.
# TEEY is the next columns (excluding the first line).
