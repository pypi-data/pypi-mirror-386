Validators Module

This module contains all validation logic and rules for the alignment
validation system. Validators implement specific validation algorithms
and rule sets for different aspects of component alignment.

Components:
- contract_spec_validator.py: Contract and specification alignment validation
- dependency_classifier.py: Dependency classification and categorization
- dependency_validator.py: Dependency relationship validation
- property_path_validator.py: Property path validation and verification
- script_contract_validator.py: Script and contract alignment validation
- testability_validator.py: Testability pattern validation

Validation Features:
- Rule-based validation logic
- Configurable validation severity levels
- Detailed error reporting with recommendations
- Pattern-based validation algorithms
- Cross-component relationship validation
