"""
Pipeline scripts module.

This module contains the actual processing scripts used by pipeline steps.
Scripts are designed to be standalone and executed independently without
dependencies on contract validation utilities.
"""

# Note: The actual script modules (currency_conversion, dummy_training, etc.)
# are typically executed as standalone scripts and don't need to be imported
# as modules. They are included here for completeness but may not be directly
# importable due to their script-oriented design.
