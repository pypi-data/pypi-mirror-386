genal: A Python Toolkit for Genetic Risk Scoring and Mendelian Randomization
============================================================================

:Author: Cyprien Rivier
:Date: |today|
:Version: "0.8"

Genal is a python module designed to make it easy to run genetic risk scores and mendelian randomization analyses. It integrates a collection of tools that facilitate the cleaning of single nucleotide polymorphism data (usually derived from Genome-Wide Association Studies) and enable the execution of key clinical population genetic workflows. The functionalities provided by genal include clumping, lifting, association testing, polygenic risk scoring, and Mendelian randomization analyses, all within a single Python module.

The module prioritizes user-friendliness and intuitive operation, aiming to reduce the complexity of data analysis for researchers. Despite its focus on simplicity, Genal does not sacrifice the depth of customization or the precision of analysis. Researchers can expect to maintain analytical rigour while benefiting from the streamlined experience.

Genal draws on concepts from well-established R packages such as TwoSampleMR, MR-Presso, MendelianRandomization, and gwasvcf, adapting their proven methodologies to the Python environment. This approach ensures that users have access to tried and tested techniques with the versatility of Python's data science tools. 

To install the latest release, type::

    pip install genal-python
