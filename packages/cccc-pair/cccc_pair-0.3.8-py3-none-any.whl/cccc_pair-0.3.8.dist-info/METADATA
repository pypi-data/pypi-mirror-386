           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# CCCC Pair - Multi-Peer Orchestrator for Evidence-First Delivery

Two always-on AI peers co-drive your repo as equals. They plan, build, critique, and converge by evidence - not by talk. You stay in control from tmux or your team chat.

:rocket: Not a chatbot UI. Not an IDE plugin. A production-minded orchestrator for long-running, real work.

## Why CCCC (pain -> payoff)

Single-agent pain (you may recognize these):
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: Stalls & restarts - context evaporates between runs; work drifts.
- :speech_balloon: Low-signal threads - long monologues, little verification, no audit trail.
- :triangular_flag_on_post: Decisions vanish - hard to see what changed and why.

CCCC payoff with two peers and repo-native anchors:
- :handshake: Multi-peer synergy - one builds, the other challenges; better options appear; errors die faster.
- :white_check_mark: Evidence-first loop - only tested/logged/committed results count as progress.
- :memo: POR/SUBPOR anchors - one strategic board (POR) + per-task sheets (SUBPOR) keep everyone aligned without ceremony.
- :bell: Low-noise cadence - built-in nudge/self-check trims chatter; the panel shows what matters, incl. "Next self-check" and "Next auto-compact".
- :mag: Auditable decisions - recent choices & pivots are captured; you can review and roll forward confidently.

## When to use CCCC
- You want autonomous progress you can trust, with small, reversible steps.
- You need collaboration you can observe in tmux/IM, not a black box.
- Your project benefits from a living strategic board and lightweight task sheets living in the repo.
- You care about repeatability: tests, stable logs, and commits as the final word.

## How it works (60 seconds)
- :link: One simple contract: peers write `<TO_USER>` / `<TO_PEER>` with a final fenced `insight` (who/kind/next/refs).
- :file_folder: Two anchors in your repo under `docs/por/`:
  - `POR.md` (strategic board): North-star, deliverables, roadmap (Now/Next/Later), risk radar, recent decisions/pivots, maintenance log.
  - `T######-slug/SUBPOR.md` (per-task sheet): goal/scope, 3-5 acceptance checks, cheapest probe, kill criteria, implementation notes, REV log, next step.
- :busts_in_silhouette: Optional Aux peer for big reviews or heavy lifting. Strategic notes sit in POR; tactical offloads sit in each SUBPOR.
- :tv: tmux UI: two panes (PeerA/PeerB) and a compact status panel. You will always see the POR path and "Next: self-check | auto-compact (policy)".

## Peers & Models (default choices, not a lock-in)

- :large_blue_circle: Peer A = Claude Code (default). We pick it for strong reasoning, careful code edits, and robust long sessions.
- :yellow_circle: Peer B = Codex CLI (default). We pick it for decisive implementation, fast iteration, and stable CLI behavior.
- :sparkles: Optional Aux = Gemini CLI (on-demand). We use it when a burst of non-interactive work helps (broad reviews, heavy tests, bulk transforms). Rationale: Gemini's long interactive sessions can be less stable in some setups, but it shines at short, structured jobs - perfect for an Aux you summon and dismiss.

Notes
- The two main peers collaborate as equals - both can think strategically and execute tactically. Aux is opt-in and task‑oriented.
- You can swap models at startup: a small roles wizard asks you to bind actors for PeerA, PeerB, and (optionally) Aux. Your choices are saved and reused next time; you can reconfigure on the next start.
- Aux is ON when you pick an actor for Aux; otherwise Aux is OFF (no runtime on/off toggles).
- CCCC is vendor‑agnostic; the orchestrator talks a simple mailbox contract.
- Strategy lives in `docs/por/POR.md`; execution details live in task SUBPORs - the peers update these naturally while working.

## What you get
- Small, reversible changes that ship continuously.
- A repo-native strategic board and per-task history you can actually read.
- IM bridges (Telegram/Slack/Discord) that bring the work to where your team already is.

---

## Requirements
- Python `>= 3.9`
- tmux (`brew install tmux` or `sudo apt install tmux`)
- git

Recommended CLIs
- :large_blue_circle: Peer A: Claude Code (default, available for Peer/Aux)
- :yellow_circle: Peer B: Codex CLI (default, available for Peer/Aux)
- :sparkles: Aux (optional): Gemini CLI (default, available for Peer/Aux)
- :robot: Also supported: Factory Droid (available for Peer/Aux)
- :hammer_and_wrench: Also supported: OpenCode (available for Peer/Aux)

## Install
- pipx (recommended)
  ```bash
  pipx install cccc-pair
  ```
- or venv
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv v && . v/bin/activate && pip install cccc-pair
  ```

## Quick Start (5 minutes)
1) Initialize in your repo
```bash
cccc init
```
2) Check environment
```bash
cccc doctor
```
3) (Optional) Connect Telegram
```bash
cccc token set  # paste your bot token (stored under .cccc/settings, gitignored)
```
4) Run orchestrator (tmux UI)
```bash
cccc run
```
- tmux opens: left/right = PeerA/PeerB, bottom-right = status panel.
- You can attach a bridge later with `cccc bridge ...` or set `autostart` in `.cccc/settings`.
5) Prepare your CLIs (one‑time)
- Put your project brief/scope in `PROJECT.md` (repo root). CCCC will weave it into the runtime SYSTEM so both peers align.
- Ensure the CLI commands for the actors you select are on PATH (e.g., `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `droid`, `opencode`), or set env overrides like `CLAUDE_I_CMD` / `CODEX_I_CMD` if needed.
- On first run, the roles wizard will ask you to choose actors for PeerA/PeerB (and optionally Aux). You can reconfigure on the next run with the same wizard.
- Inspect current bindings anytime: `cccc roles`.

Aux (optional)
- Aux runs as a one‑off helper when you ask for it; there are no runtime on/off toggles.
- In tmux: run `/c <prompt>` or `c: <prompt>` to invoke Aux once.
- In chat bridges: use `/aux-cli "<prompt>"` to invoke Aux once.
- For a strategic review or external check, use `/review` to send a clear reminder bundle to both peers.

## A typical session (end-to-end, ~3 minutes)
1) Explore (short)
- In chat (or tmux), route an idea to both: `both: add a short section to README about team chat tips`.
- One peer frames intent; the other asks one focused question.
2) Decide (concise CLAIM)
- Write a CLAIM in `to_peer.md` with acceptance & constraints; the other peer COUNTERs with a sharper place or safer rollout.
3) Build (evidence-first)
- Propose a small, verifiable change with a 1-2 line EVIDENCE note (tests OK / stable logs / commit refs).
- Orchestrator logs outcomes to the ledger; the status panel updates.
4) Team visibility
- Telegram/Slack/Discord (optional) receive concise summaries; peers stay quiet unless blocked.

Cadence
- Every N handoffs (configurable), the orchestrator triggers a short self‑check to keep both peers aligned.
- PeerB also receives a "POR update requested …" reminder: review `POR.md` and all active `SUBPOR.md` (Goal/Acceptance/Probe/Kill/Next), align POR Now/Next with each SUBPOR Next, close/rescope stale items, ensure evidence/risks/decisions have recent refs, and check for gaps (create a new SUBPOR after peer ACK if needed).

## Foreman (User Proxy)
- Purpose: a lightweight “user proxy” that runs on a timer and either does one non‑interactive task or writes one short user‑voice request to the right peer.
- Enable at startup: in the roles wizard, choose a Foreman agent (or `none` to disable). You can reuse Aux or pick an actor like `opencode`.
- Task brief: edit `./FOREMAN_TASK.md` (free‑form; describe what matters now and list the standing tasks you want Foreman to perform). The system rules live at `.cccc/rules/FOREMAN.md`.
- Cadence: runs every 15 minutes by default (first run is slightly delayed after startup); runs never overlap.
- Visibility:
  - Panel shows: `Foreman: RUNNING | last @ HH:MM rc=N | next @ HH:MM | cc: ON/OFF`.
  - IM shows Foreman messages as `[FOREMAN→PeerA] …` or `[FOREMAN→PeerB] …` (short text; long outputs are stored in `.cccc/work/foreman/<timestamp>/`).
- Controls:
  - `/verbose on|off` toggles peer summaries and Foreman CC to chat.
  - `/foreman on|off|status` (only allowed if Foreman was enabled at startup) shows/toggles the scheduler.

## Folder layout (after `cccc init`)
```
.cccc/
  adapters/bridge_*.py            # chat bridges (optional)
  settings/                        # runtime profiles (tmux/bridges)

  state/                           # ledger.jsonl, status/session (ephemeral)
  logs/                            # extra logs (ephemeral)
  orchestrator_tmux.py panel_status.py prompt_weaver.py ...

docs/
  por/
    POR.md                         # strategic board (North-star, deliverables, roadmap, risks, decisions)
    T000123-your-task/SUBPOR.md    # per-task sheet (goal/acceptance/probe/kill/impl/REV/next)
```

## POR/SUBPOR anchors (in your repo)
- `docs/por/POR.md` is the strategic board.
- `docs/por/T######-slug/SUBPOR.md` is a per-task sheet.
- Peers keep these brief and current as they work; you can read them any time.

## FAQ (short)
- **Does CCCC lock me into a UI?** No. tmux is default; IM bridges are optional and transport-agnostic.
- **Can I run only locally?** Yes. Everything works without any bridge.
- **What about safety?** Chats never change state. "Done" means tests/logs/commits. Irreversible changes are explicit and deliberate.
