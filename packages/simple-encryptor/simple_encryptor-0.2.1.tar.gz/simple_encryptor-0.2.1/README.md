# Simple Encryptor

A secure and easy-to-use AES-GCM encryption/decryption package for Python.

## Why Use Simple Encryptor?

- **No Key Management Hassle**: Just provide any key of your choice - no strict length requirements
- **Military-Grade Security**: Uses AES-GCM encryption (same standard used by banks and governments)
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with minimal setup
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install simple-encryptor
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from encryptor import Encryptor

# Create an encryptor with your chosen key
encryptor = Encryptor("my-secret-key-123")

# Encrypt your data
data = "Hello, World!"
encrypted = encryptor.encrypt(data)
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted}")

# Decrypt your data
decrypted = encryptor.decrypt(encrypted)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted}")
```

### File Encryption

```python
# Encrypt a file
encryptor.encrypt_file("document.txt", "document.txt.encrypted")

# Decrypt a file
encryptor.decrypt_file("document.txt.encrypted", "document_restored.txt")
```

## Key Features

- **Any Key Length**: Use any key you want - short or long, it doesn't matter
