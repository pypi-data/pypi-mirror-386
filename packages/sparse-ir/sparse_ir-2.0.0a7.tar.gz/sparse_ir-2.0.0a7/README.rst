sparse-ir - A library for the intermediate representation of propagators
========================================================================
This library provides routines for constructing and working with the
intermediate representation of correlation functions.  It provides:

 - on-the-fly computation of basis functions for arbitrary cutoff Î›
 - basis functions and singular values are accurate to full precision
 - routines for sparse sampling


Installation
------------
Install via `pip <https://pypi.org/project/sparse-ir>`_::

    pip install sparse-ir

Install via `conda <https://anaconda.org/spm-lab/sparse-ir>`_::

    conda install -c spm-lab sparse-ir

sparse-ir requires `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_, `scipy <https://scipy.org/>`_,
and `pylibsparseir <https://pypi.org/project/pylibsparseir>`_ (a thin Python wrapper
for the `libsparseir <https://github.com/SpM-lab/libsparseir>`_ C API).

To manually install the current development version, you can use the following::

   # Only recommended for developers - no automatic updates!
   git clone https://github.com/SpM-lab/sparse-ir
   cd sparse-ir
   uv sync

Note: `uv` is a fast Python package manager. If you don't have it installed,
you can install it with ``pip install uv`` or use ``pip install -e .`` instead.

Building documentation
----------------------
To build the documentation locally, first install the development dependencies::

   uv sync --group doc

Then build the documentation::

   uv run sphinx-build -M html doc _build/html

The documentation will be available in ``_build/html/html/index.html``.

Documentation and tutorial
--------------------------
Check out our `comprehensive tutorial`_, where we self-contained
notebooks for several many-body methods - GF(2), GW, Eliashberg equations,
Lichtenstein formula, FLEX, ... - are presented.

Refer to the `API documentation`_ for more details on how to work
with the python library.

There is also a `Julia library`_ and (currently somewhat restricted)
`C library with Fortran bindings`_ available for the IR basis and sparse sampling.

Getting started
---------------
Here is a full second-order perturbation theory solver (GF(2)) in a few
lines of Python code::

    # Construct the IR basis and sparse sampling for fermionic propagators
    import sparse_ir, numpy as np
    basis = sparse_ir.FiniteTempBasis('F', beta=10, wmax=8, eps=1e-6)
    stau = sparse_ir.TauSampling(basis)
    siw = sparse_ir.MatsubaraSampling(basis, positive_only=True)

    # Solve the single impurity Anderson model coupled to a bath with a
    # semicircular states with unit half bandwidth.
    U = 1.2
    def rho0w(w):
        return np.sqrt(1-w.clip(-1,1)**2) * 2/np.pi

    # Compute the IR basis coefficients for the non-interacting propagator
    rho0l = basis.v.overlap(rho0w)
    G0l = -basis.s * rho0l

    # Self-consistency loop: alternate between second-order expression for the
    # self-energy and the Dyson equation until convergence.
    Gl = G0l
    Gl_prev = 0
    while np.linalg.norm(Gl - Gl_prev) > 1e-6:
        Gl_prev = Gl
        Gtau = stau.evaluate(Gl)
        Sigmatau = U**2 * Gtau**3
        Sigmal = stau.fit(Sigmatau)
        Sigmaiw = siw.evaluate(Sigmal)
        G0iw = siw.evaluate(G0l)
        Giw = 1/(1/G0iw - Sigmaiw)
        Gl = siw.fit(Giw)

You may want to start with reading up on the `intermediate representation`_.
It is tied to the analytic continuation of bosonic/fermionic spectral
functions from (real) frequencies to imaginary time, a transformation mediated
by a kernel ``K``.  The kernel depends on a cutoff, which you should choose to
be ``lambda_ >= beta * W``, where ``beta`` is the inverse temperature and ``W``
is the bandwidth.

One can now perform a `singular value expansion`_ on this kernel, which
generates two sets of orthonormal basis functions, one set ``v[l](w)`` for
real frequency side ``w``, and one set ``u[l](tau)`` for the same obejct in
imaginary (Euclidean) time ``tau``, together with a "coupling" strength
``s[l]`` between the two sides.

By this construction, the imaginary time basis can be shown to be *optimal* in
terms of compactness.

Development
-----------
For developers, this repository includes tools to ensure consistency between
different package managers:

- **Version Consistency Check**: Ensures that ``pylibsparseir`` version
  specifications in ``pyproject.toml`` and ``.conda/meta.yaml`` are consistent.

  Run the check manually::

      python check_version_consistency.py

  Or install as a pre-commit hook::

      pip install pre-commit
      pre-commit install
