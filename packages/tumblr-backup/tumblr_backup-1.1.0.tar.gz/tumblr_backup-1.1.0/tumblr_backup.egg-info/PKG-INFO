# tumblr-backup

### About this fork

This is a fork of bbolli's
[tumblr-utils](https://github.com/bbolli/tumblr-utils), with a focus on
tumblr\_backup.py. It adds Python 3 compatibility, various bug fixes, a few
enhancements to normal operation, support for dashboard-only blogs, and several
other features - see the output of `tumblr-backup --help` for the full list of
options.

---

## 0. Description

tumblr-backup is a script that backs up your [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) blog
locally.

The backup includes all images both from inline text as well as photo posts. An
index links to monthly pages, which contain all the posts from the respective
month with links to single post pages. Command line options select which posts
to backup and set the output format. The audio and video files can also be
saved.

By default, all posts of a blog are backed up in minimally styled HTML5.

You can see an example of its output [on my home page](http://drbeat.li/tumblr).


## 1. Installation

1. Install the latest Python 3.
2. Run `pip install tumblr-backup` from a command line.
3. Create an "app" at https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps. Follow the instructions
   there; most values entered don't matter.
4. Run `tumblr-backup --set-api-key API_KEY`, where API\_KEY is the OAuth Consumer
   Token from the app created in the previous step.
5. Run `tumblr-backup blog-name` as often as you like manually or from a cron
   job.

There are several optional extras that enable additional features:

1. The `video` extra enables the `--save-video` and `--save-video-tumblr` options, which
   download videos using yt-dlp. If you need HTTP cookies to download, use an appropriate
   browser plugin to extract the cookie(s) into a file and use option `--cookiefile=file`.
   See [issue 132].
2. The `exif` extra enables the `--exif` option, which adds post tags to the EXIF metadata
   of JPEG files. This pulls in the `py3exiv2` module which may have additional
   prerequites depending on your platform. See the below section on installing py3exiv2.
3. The `bs4` extra enables the `--save-notes` option, which saves the list of accounts
   that reblogged or liked a public post.
4. The `jq` extra enables the `--filter` option to filter the downloaded posts with arbitrary
   rules based on their metadata.
5. The `dashboard` extra enables backing up dashboard-only blogs by installing `quickjs` for
   fast NPF (Neue Post Format) rendering. This is required for dashboard-only blogs. It pulls in `quickjs` by default.
   `miniracer` is also supported, in case the `quickjs` package is not available - but it must be installed manually to
   use it as a fallback (`pip install mini-racer`).
6. The `all` extra includes all of the above features.

To install one or more extras, put them in square brackets after the package name in the
pip command. Multiple extras may be separated by commas. Make sure to quote the command
properly, as square brackets have a special meaning in many environments when not quoted.

For example:
```
pip install 'tumblr-backup[video,bs4]'
```

[issue 132]: (https://github.com/bbolli/tumblr-utils/issues/132)


### 1a. Notes About py3exiv2

`py3exiv2` is not a pure Python package, and requires OS-specific dependencies. If you
would like to install the `exif` or `all` extras, you may need to install additional
dependencies for the `pip install` command to succeed.

For example, on macOS, these steps successfully install the `exif` extra (requires [Homebrew]):
```
brew install boost-python3 exiv2
export CPATH=/opt/homebrew/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib
pip install 'tumblr-backup[exif]'
```

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/

### Arguments

_blog-name_: The name of the blog to backup.

If your blog is under `.tumblr.com`, you can give just the first domain name
part; if your blog is under your own domain, give the whole domain name. You
can give more than one _blog-name_ to backup multiple blogs in one go.

The default blog name(s) can be changed by copying `settings.py.example` to
`settings.py` and adding the name(s) to the `DEFAULT_BLOGS` list.

### Environment variables

`LC_ALL`, `LC_TIME`, `LANG`: These variables, in decreasing importance,
determine the locale for month names and the date/time format.

### Exit code

The exit code is 0 if at least one post has been backed up, 1 if no post has
been backed up, 2 on invocation errors, 3 if the backup was interrupted, or 4
on HTTP errors.


## 3. Operation

By default, tumblr-backup backs up all posts in HTML format.

The generated directory structure looks like this:

    ./ - the current directory
        <outdir>/ - your blog backup
            index.html - table of contents with links to the monthly pages
            backup.css - the default backup style sheet
            custom.css - the user's style sheet (optional)
            override.css - the user's style sheet override (optional)
            archive/
                <yyyy-mm-pnn>.html - the monthly pages
                …
            posts/
                <id>.html - the single post pages
                …
            media/
                <image.ext> - image files
                <audio>.mp3 - audio files
                <video>.mp4 - video files
                …
            json/
                <id>.json - the original JSON posts
                …
            tags/
                index.html - the index of all tag indices
                <tag>/index.html - the index for <tag>
                    archive/
                        <yyyy-mm-pnn>.html - the monthly pages for <tag>
            theme/
                avatar.<ext> - the blog’s avatar
                style.css - the blog’s style sheet

The default `outdir` is the `blog-name`.

If option `-D` is used, one folder per post is generated, and the post's
images are saved in the same folder. The monthly archive is also stored in a
folder per month. This results in the same URL structure as on the Tumblr page.

The directories look like this:

    ./ - the current directory
        <outdir>/ - your blog backup
            index.html - table of contents with links to the monthly pages
            backup.css - the default backup style sheet
            custom.css - the user's style sheet (optional)
            override.css - the user's style sheet override (optional)
            archive/
                <yyyy-mm-pnn>/
                    index.html - the monthly page
                …
            posts/
                <id>/
                    index.html - the single post page
                    <image.ext> - the image file(s) for this post
                    <audio>.mp3 - audio files
                    <video>.mp4 - video files
                    …
                …
            json/
                <id>.json - the original JSON posts
                …
            theme/
                avatar.<ext> - the blog’s avatar
                style.css - the blog’s style sheet

The modification time of the single post pages is set to the post’s timestamp.
tumblr-backup applies a simple style to the saved pages. All generated pages are
[HTML5](http://html5.org).

The index pages are recreated from scratch after every backup, based on the
existing single post pages. Normally, the index and monthly pages are in
reverse chronological order, i.e. more recent entries on top. The options `-R`
and `-r` can be used to reverse the order.

Option `--tag-index` creates a tag index for each tag used in the posts.
It can be reached through the "Tag index" link in the main index.

If you want to use a custom CSS file, call it `custom.css`, put it in the backup
folder and do a complete backup. Without a custom CSS file, tumblr-backup saves
a default style sheet in `backup.css`. The blog's style sheet itself is always
saved in `theme/style.css`.

It you want to override just a few default styles, create the file
`override.css` in the backup folder. This file is included automatically by the
default style sheet. You may have to mark your overriding styles with
`!important` to make them stick because `override.css` is imported first in the
style sheet.

Tumblr saves some image files without extension. This probably saves a few
billion bytes in their database. tumblr-backup restores the image extensions. If
an image is already backed up, it is not downloaded again. If an image is
re-uploaded/edited, the old image is kept in the backup, but no post links to
it. The format of the image file names can be selected with the `-I` option.

It must be noted that saved inline images (from non-photo posts) keep their
name. This means that only the first image with any given name will be saved;
the others with the same name will point to the first one.

The download of images can be disabled with option `-k`. In this case, the
image URLs will point to the original location.

With option `-e`, IPTC keyword tags can be added to image files. There are
three possibilities:

1. `-e kw1,kw2` adds the post's tags plus `kw1` and `kw2` as keywords
2. `-e ''` adds just the post's tags
3. `-e -` removes all keywords from the image

In incremental backup mode, tumblr-backup saves only posts that have higher ids
than the highest id saved locally. Note that posts that are edited after being
backed up are not backed up again with this option.

In JSON backup mode, the original JSON source returned by the Tumblr API is
saved under the `json/` folder in addition to the HTML format.

Automatic archive mode `-a` is designed to be used from an hourly cron script.
It normally makes an incremental backup except if the current hour is the one
given as argument. In this case, tumblr-backup will make a full backup. An
example invocation is `tumblr-backup -qa4` to do a full backup at 4 in the
morning. This option obviates the need for shell script logic to determine what
options to pass. If you don't want cron to send a mail if no new posts have been
backed up, use this crontab entry:

    0 * * * * tumblr-backup -qa4 <blog-name> || test $? -eq 1

This changes the exit code 1 to 0.

In Blosxom format mode, the posts generated are saved in a format suitable for
re-publishing in [Blosxom](http://www.blosxom.com) with the [Meta
plugin](http://www.blosxom.com/plugins/meta/meta.htm). Images are not
downloaded; instead, the image links point back to the original image on
Tumblr. The posts are saved in the current folder with a `.txt` extension. The
index is not updated.

In order to limit the set of backed up posts, use the `-n` and `-s` options. The
most recent post is always number 0, so the option `-n 200` would select the 200
most recent posts. Calling `tumblr-backup -n 100 -s 200` would skip the 200 most
recent posts and backup the next 100. `-n 1` is the fastest way to rebuild the
index pages.

The option `-T` limits the backup to posts of the given type. `-t` saves only
posts with the given tags. `-Q` combines both: it accepts comma-separated
requests of the form `TYPE:TAG1:TAG2:…`, where the tags for each post type can
be different. Omitting the TAGs is allowed; this saves posts of this type with
any or no tags. Example: `-Q any:personal,quote,photo:me:self` saves all posts
tagged 'personal', all quotes, and photos tagged 'me' or 'self' or 'personal'
(because of the `any` request).

The option `--no-reblog` suppresses the backup of reposts of other blogs'
posts.

If you combine `-n`, `-s`, `-i`, `-p`, `-t`, `-T`, `-Q` and `--no-reblog`, only
posts matching all criteria will be backed up.

All options use only public Tumblr APIs, so you can use the program to backup
blogs that you don’t own.
