        """
        Wrapper for passing Jacobian-vector product functions to IDA. The
        Jacobian-vector product interface is only supported by iterative solvers
        (gmres, bicgstab, tfqmr).

        Parameters
        ----------
        setupfn : Callable or None
            A function to setup data before solving the Jacobian-vector product.
            Use None if not needed. The required signature is in the notes.
        solvefn : Callable
            A function that solves for the Jacobian-vector product ``J*v`` (or
            an approximation to it). The required signature is in the notes.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            'setupfn' must be type Callable or None.
        TypeError
            'solvefn' must be type Callable.

        Notes
        -----
        The solve and setup functions require specific function signatures. For
        'solvefn' use ``f(t, y, yp, res, v, Jv, cj[, userdata])``. Any return
        values are ignored. Instead, the function should fill the pre-allocated
        memory for 'Jv' (a 1D array) with the solution (or approximation) to
        ``J*v``. Use ``[:]`` to fill the array rather than overwriting it. For
        example, ``Jv[:] = f(...)`` is correct whereas ``Jv = f(...)`` is not.
        The user is responsible for managing their own Jacobian data if needed.
        'setupfn' can be used to help setup any needed values/data so that
        'solvefn' is not overly complex.

        'setupfn' requires the signature ``f(t, y, yp, res, cj[, userdata])``.
        As with 'solvefn', any return values are ignored. However, you can use
        the function to define global variables or add them to ``userdata`` so
        they can be passed to 'solvefn'. The order of function calls is always
        'resfn' -> 'setupfn' -> 'solvefn' for each integration step.
