# yardstick

A tool that can parse and compare the results of vulnerability scanner tools.

Manage and explore scan results:
```
# capture a new scan result for a specific tool and image
yardstick result capture --image ubuntu:20.04 -t grype@v0.11.0

# list all scan results that have been captured
yardstick result list

# explore the scan results interactively
yardstick result explore <UUID>
```

Manage true positive / false positive labels for images:
```
# explore labels applied to specific scan-result matches for an image and tool pair
yardstick label explore <UUID>

# list all managed labels
yardstick label list
```

Supported scanners:
- `grype`
- `syft`

### F.A.Q.

*"Why is syft on this list? It's not a vulnerability scanner!"*

Right you are, however, capturing SBOM results that can be fed into grype or for
reference during analysis is quite useful!


*"Yardstick doesn't support vulnerability scanner X..."*

PR's are welcome! The goal of this tool is to provide the analysis capabilities
to understand how we can make these scanners better.



## Result Sets

Result sets can be useful to operate on and track results from scans taken at the same time. For instance:
```yaml
# .yardstick.yaml
result-sets:
  example:
    matrix:
      images:
        - ubuntu:20.04
      tools:
        - name: grype
          version: v0.32.0
        - name: grype
          version: v0.48.0
```

```bash
# capture results for all tools
$ yardstick result capture -r example

# see the specific result details
$ yardstick result list -r example

# perform a label comparison using all tooling
$ yardstick label compare -r example
```


## Configuration

Sample application config:
```yaml
# .yardstick.yaml

x-ref:
  images: &images
    - docker.io/cloudbees/cloudbees-core-mm:2.346.4.1@sha256:b8ec61aad2f5f9be2dc9c68923eab1de0e8b026176093ad2e0742fca310bf3bf

result-sets:
  pr-vs-latest:
    description: "latest released grype vs grype from the current build"
    matrix:
      images: *images
      tools:
        - name: syft                      # go ahead and capture an SBOM each time to help analysis later
          version: v0.54.0
          produces: SBOM

        - name: grype                     # from the latest published github release
          version: latest
          takes: SBOM

        - name: grype:pr                  # from a local PR checkout install (feed via an environment variable)
          version: env:CURRENT_GRYPE_COMMIT
          takes: SBOM
```
