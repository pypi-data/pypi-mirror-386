# This is an example configuration to enable detect-secrets in the pre-commit hook.
# Add this file to the root folder of your repository.
#
# Read pre-commit hook framework https://pre-commit.com/ for more details about the structure of config yaml file and how git pre-commit would invoke each hook.
#
# This line indicates we will use the hook from ibm/detect-secrets to run scan during committing phase.
