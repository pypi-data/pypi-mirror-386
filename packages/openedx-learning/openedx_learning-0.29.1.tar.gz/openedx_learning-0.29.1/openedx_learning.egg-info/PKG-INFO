Open edX Learning Core (and Tagging)
====================================

|pypi-badge| |ci-badge| |codecov-badge| |doc-badge| |pyversions-badge|
|license-badge|

Overview
--------

The ``openedx_learning`` package holds Django apps that represent core learning concepts and data models that have been extracted from edx-platform. At the moment, this repo also contains the ``openedx_tagging`` package, but this will likely be moved out in the future.

Motivation
----------

The short term goal of this project is to create a small, extensible core that is easier to reason about and write extensions for than edx-platform. The longer term goal is to create a more nimble core learning platform, enabling rapid experimentation and drastic changes to the learner experience that are difficult to implement with Open edX today.

Replacing edx-platform is explicitly *not* a goal of this project, as only a small fraction of the concepts in edx-platform make sense to carry over here. When these core concepts are extracted and the data migrated, edx-platform will import apps from this repo and make use of their public in-process APIs.

Architecture
------------

Parts
~~~~~

* ``openedx_learning.lib`` is for shared utilities, and may include things like custom field types, plugin registration code, etc.
* ``openedx_learning.apps`` contains our Learning Core Django apps, where foundational data structures and APIs will live. The first of these is ``authoring``, which holds apps related to the editing and publishing of learning content.
* ``openedx_tagging.core`` contains the core Tagging app, which provides data structures and apis for tagging Open edX objects.

Learning Core Package Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Learning Core code should never import from ``edx-platform``.

We want to be very strict about dependency management internally as well. Please read the `.importlinter config file <.importlinter>`_ file and the `Python API Conventions ADR <docs/decisions/0016-python-public-api-conventions>`_ for more details.


Model Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have a few different identifier types in the schema, and we try to avoid ``_id`` for this because Django uses that convention to reference IDs in other models/tables. So instead we have:

* ``id`` is the auto-generated, internal row ID and primary key. This never changes. Data models should make foreign keys to this field, as per Django convention.
* ``uuid`` is a randomly generated UUID4. This is the stable way to refer to a row/resource from an external service. This never changes. This is separate from ``id`` mostly because there are performance penalties when using UUIDs as primary keys with MySQL.
* ``key`` is intended to be a case-sensitive, alphanumeric key, which holds some meaning to library clients. This is usually stable, but can be changed, depending on the business logic of the client. The apps in this repo should make no assumptions about it being stable. It can be used as a suffix. Since ``key`` is a reserved name on certain database systems, the database field is ``_key``.
* ``num`` is like ``key``, but for use when it's strictly numeric. It can also be used as a suffix.

* [Scaling Django to 500 apps](https://2021.djangocon.us/talks/scaling-django-to-500-apps/) (Dan Palmer, DjangoCon US 2021)

Code Overview
-------------

The ``openedx_learning.apps`` package contains all our Django applications.

Development Workflow
--------------------

One Time Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:ormsbee/openedx-learning.git
  cd openedx-learning

  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it
  mkvirtualenv -p python3.11 openedx-learning


Every time you develop something in this repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block::

  # Activate the virtualenv
  workon openedx-learning

  # Grab the latest code
  git checkout master
  git pull

  # Install/update the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)
  make validate

  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  vim …

  # Run your new tests
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the tests and quality checks
  make validate

  # Commit all your changes
  git commit …
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.

Configuring Visual Studio Code
------------------------------

If you are using VS Code as your editor, you can enable the Testing bar by copying from the example configuration provided in the ``.vscode`` directory::

    cd .vscode/
    cp launch.json.example launch.json
    cp settings.json.example settings.json
