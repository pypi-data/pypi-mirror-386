              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# NVIDIA Eval Factory

The goal of NVIDIA Eval Factory is to advance and refine state-of-the-art methodologies for model evaluation, and deliver them as modular evaluation packages (evaluation containers and pip wheels) that teams can use as standardized building blocks.

## Quick Start Guide

NVIDIA Eval Factory provides you with evaluation clients that are specifically built to evaluate model endpoints using our Standard API.

### Prerequisites

**Important**: Both the model under test and the judge model must be deployed by the user locally before running evaluations.

### Launching an Evaluation for an LLM

1. Install the package:
    ```bash
    pip install nvidia-safety-harness
    ```

2. Deploy your models locally: 
   - Deploy the model you want to evaluate (model under test), e.g. on `http://localhost:8000`
   - Deploy the appropriate judge model for your evaluation type, e.g. on `http://localhost:8001` (see [Judge Configuration](#judge-configuration))
   - Both models should be accessible via HTTP API endpoints

3. Authenticate with Hugging Face: You need to authenticate to the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/quick-start#authentication) as some datasets or models might need to be downloaded during evaluation.
    ```bash
    huggingface-cli login
    ```

4. List the available evaluations:
    ```bash
    $ eval-factory ls
    safety_eval: 
      * aegis_v2
      * aegis_v2_reasoning
      * wildguard
    ```

5. (Optional) Set API keys for the model under test endpoint and the judge model endpoint, if they are protected:
    ```bash
    export MUT_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    export JUDGE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

6. Run the evaluation:
   ```bash
    eval-factory run_eval \
    --model_id "meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct" \
    --model_url http://localhost:8000/v1 \
    --model_type chat \
    --api_key_name MUT_API_KEY \
    --output_dir /workspace/results \
    --eval_type aegis_v2 \
    --overrides="config.params.extra.judge.url=http://localhost:8001/v1"
   ```

7. Gather the results:
    ```bash
    cat /workspace/results/results.yml
    ```

## CLI Specification

1. Required flags:
   * `--eval_type <string>`: The type of evaluation to perform
   * `--model_id <string>`: The name or identifier of the model under test to evaluate
   * `--model_url <url>`: The API endpoint where the model under test is accessible
   * `--model_type <string>`: The type of the model under test to evaluate, currently either "chat", "completions", or "vlm"
   * `--output_dir <directory>`: The directory to use as the working directory for the evaluation. The results, including the `results.yml` output file, will be saved here. Make sure to use the absolute path

2. Required overrides:
   * `config.params.extra.judge.url`: URL for the judge model endpoint

3. Optional flags:
   * `--api_key_name <string>`: The name of the environment variable that stores the bearer token for the model under test API, if authentication is required (specify as "MUT_API_KEY" if needed)
   * `--run_config <path>`: Specifies the path to a YAML file containing the evaluation definition
   * `--dry_run`: Allows you to print the final configuration and command without executing the evaluation

## Configuring Evaluations via YAML

Evaluations in NVIDIA Eval Factory are configured using YAML files that define the parameters and settings required for the evaluation process. These configuration files follow a standard API which ensures consistency across evaluations.

Example of a YAML configuration:
```yaml
config:
  type: aegis_v2
  params:
    limit_samples: 10
    extra:
      judge:
        url: http://localhost:8001/v1
target:
  api_endpoint:
    model_id: meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct
    type: chat
    url: http://localhost:8000/v1
```

The priority of overrides is as follows:
1. Command-line arguments
2. User configuration (as seen above)
3. Task defaults (defined per task type)
4. Framework defaults

**Example:**

```bash
eval-factory run_eval \
    --run_config config.yaml \
    --api_key_name MUT_API_KEY \
    --output_dir /workspace/results
```

With `--dry_run`, the following configuration is printed to the console:

```bash
eval-factory run_eval \
    --run_config config.yaml \
    --api_key_name MUT_API_KEY \
    --output_dir /workspace/results \
    --dry_run
```

**Output:**

```bash
Rendered config:

command: '{% if target.api_endpoint.api_key is not none %}export API_KEY=${{target.api_endpoint.api_key}}  &&
  {% endif %} {% if config.params.extra.judge.api_key is not none %}export JUDGE_API_KEY=${{config.params.extra.judge.api_key}}
  && {% endif %} safety-eval  --model-name  {{target.api_endpoint.model_id}} --model-url

  --judge-inference-params concurrency={{config.params.extra.judge.parallelism}},retries={{config.params.max_retries}}  {%

```

## Tasks Configuration

Each evaluation requires its own judge model to be deployed by the user, e.g. on `http://localhost:8001`.

### Aegis_v2
**Judge Model:** `llama-3.1-nemoguard-8b-content-safety`
- Deployment: Follow [NIM deployment guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/llama-3-1-nemoguard-8b-contentsafety/latest/getting-started.html)
- Endpoint Type: Completion endpoint
- Tokenizer: `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` (ensure Hugging Face access)

Please note that if you evaluate reasoning model with aegis_v2, you should use `aegis_v2_reasoning` that is going to evaluate responses with and without thinking traces. No reasoning adapter should be turned on for that evaluation.

### Wildguard
**Judge Model:** `allenai/wildguard`
- Deployment: Use [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) version `v0.8.5`
- Endpoint Type: Completion endpoint
- Tokenizer: `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3` (base model tokenizer)
- Command:
  ```bash
  docker run -it --gpus all -p 8001:8000 vllm/vllm-openai:v0.8.5 --model allenai/wildguard
  ```
