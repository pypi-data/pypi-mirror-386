    "## Relevant Properties\n",
    "For reasons related to how CARMA was originally designed, condensate properties are tied to the limiting gas resevoir the condensate is formed from.  Thus, defining a custom condensate means creating a custom `carmapy.Gas` object.  This unfortunately has a side effect that each gas can only form condensates of a single chemical formula (ie a gas can form Pure Fe and Fe on TiO₂ condensates but cannot also form Fe₂SiO₄ on TiO2 as the latter has a different chemical formula).\n",
    "\n",
    "A large number of properties need to be defined for a custom condensate, we will go through them below but you can also see a reference page for the `carmapy.Gas` object [here](https://carmapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/carmapy.Gas.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "For purposes of this tutorial, we will be recreating Al₂O₃\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so we need to know the following properties:\n",
    "- The density of the condensate\n",
    "- The molar mass of the condensate\n",
    "- The molar mass of the limiting gas species\n",
    "- The collisional diameter\n",
    "- The cosine of the contact angle between the gas species and any seed particles it might be condensing on\n",
    "- The [Hill Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula#Hill_system) Formula for the gas species\n",
    "- The formula for the saturation vapor pressure of the condensate (explained below)\n",
    "- The formula for the surface tension of the condensate (expalined below)\n",
    "- The stochiometry factor of the condensation reaction (explained below)\n",
    "- Whether or not the reaction is considered a type III reaction (explained below)\n",
    "- (Optionally) the latent heat of evaporation for the condensate\n",

    "### Simple Properties\n",
    "- Al₂O₃ has a density of 3.99 g/cm³\n",
    "- Al₂O₃ has a molar mass of 101.926 g/mol\n",
    "- The limiting gas species, Al, has a molar mass of 26.98 g/mol\n",
    "- Al₂O₃'s collisional diameter is approximately $3.825\\times10^{-8}$ cm (value estimated from Dobrovinskaya et al. 2009)\n",
    "- The cosine of the contact angle betweel Al₂O₃ and TiO₂ is 0.724172 (value taken from P. Gao et al. 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saturation Vapor Pressure\n",
    "The saturation vapor pressure of a species can be a function of both pressure and temperature.  carmapy assumes that the formula for vapor pressure can be paramaterized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\log_{10} \\frac{p'}{10^6 \\text{ barye}} &=  \\texttt{vp_offset} \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p'$ is the saturation vapor pressure, $T$ is the temperature, and $P$ is the atmospheric pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the values from Wakeford et al. 2017 for Al₂O₃ we have:\n",
    "- `vp_offset` = 17.7\n",

    "- `vp_metcoeff` = 1.66\n",
    "- `vp_logpcoeff` = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surface Tension\n",
    "CARMApy also parameterizes the surface tension of condensates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\texttt{surface_tension} = \\texttt{surften_0}  - \\texttt{surften_slope} * T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T$ is the temperature in K.\n",
    "\n",

    "- `surften_0` = 690 dyne/cm\n",
    "- `surften_slope` = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stoichiometry Factor\n",
    "The stoichiometry factor is determined by the reaction that forms the condensate, ie for a reaction which is\n",
    "$$X (\\text{limiting gas}) + (\\text{other stuff}) \\to Y (\\text{condensate}) + (\\text{some other stuff})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the stoichiometry factor is $X/Y$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are considering Al as our limiting gas and it takes 2 monatomic Al to form 1 molecule Al₂O₃, the stoichiometry factor will be 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type III reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Condensates which form via type III reactions, as defined by Helling and Woitke 2012 have a modified super saturation ratio.  Type III reactions are reactions that, besides for the condensate, have 2 or more products or 2 or more reactants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the main chemical reaction which forms Al₂O₃ is\n",
    "$$2 \\text{AlOH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\to \\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3 [\\text{s}] + 2 \\text{H}_2$$\n",

    "### Latent heat of evaporation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose to provide a latent heat of evaporation, if you don't CARMApy will calculate one for you following the assumptions of Charnay et al. 2015 (TODO: check this citation):\n",
