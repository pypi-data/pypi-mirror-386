CARMApy's documentation
===================================

CARMApy is a python wrapper of the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), originally developed by Turco et al. (1979) and Toon et al. (1979).  carmapy specifically wraps exoCARMA, a version of CARMA developed by Gao et al. (2018) and Powell et al. (2018) to model clouds on exoplanets.

**NOTE: carmapy is in beta.  This means that the API is not yet stable and future updates have a chance of breaking your code.  Also, while I believe everything is working properly, we have yet to benchmark CARMApy for correctness against other models.**

If you have any questions, feature requests, or find a bug please either email me at `wcukier@uchicago.edu <mailto:wcukier@uchicago.edu>`_ or open a `issue on GitHub <https://github.com/wcukier/carmapy/issues>`_.
