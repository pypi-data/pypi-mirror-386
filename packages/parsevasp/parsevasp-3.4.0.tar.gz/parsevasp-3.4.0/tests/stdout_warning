|     You use a magnetic or noncollinear calculation, but did not specify     |
|     the initial magnetic moment with the MAGMOM tag. Note that a            |
|     default of 1 will be used for all atoms. This ferromagnetic setup       |
|     may break the symmetry of the crystal, in particular it may rule        |
|     out finding an antiferromagnetic solution. Thence, we recommend         |
|     setting the initial magnetic moment manually or verifying carefully     |
|     that this magnetic setup is desired.                                    |
|                                                                             |
