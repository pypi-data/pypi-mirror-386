## About

Jellyjoin does "soft joins" based not exact matches, but on approximate similarity. It uses a cost based
optimization to find the "best" match. It can use older string similarity metrics as well but using a
embedding model allows semantic similarity to be used and gives very robust and high quality matches.

By default, jellyjoin will attempt to use OpenAI embedding models to calculate similarity if you have the `openai`
package installed and an `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment. If that fails, it uses Damerau-Levenshtein similarity,
a string distance metric suitable for a wide range of use cases.
(You can, of course, fully specify the similarity strategy to use a different embedding model or similarity metric;
this is covered in the Advanced Usage section below.)

## Installation

```bash
pip install jellyjoin
```

---

## Basic Usage

First, set up the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable if you want to use the OpenAI embedding models (recommended.)
You can also configure a custom `SimilarityStrategy` if you want to use another embedding model or other string
comparison metric.

Then the most basic way to use `jellyjoin` is to simply pass it two lists:

```python
import jellyjoin

association_df = jellyjoin.jellyjoin(
    ["Introduction", "Mathematical Methods", "Empirical Validation", "Anticipating Criticisms", "Future Work"],
    ["Abstract", "Experimental Results", "Proposed Extensions", "Theoretical Modeling", "Limitations"],
)
```

It always returns the result as a Pandas DataFrame, with the left index, right index, similarity score. If you
pass lists or other iterables, it will name the columns for the values "Left Value" and "Right Value".

|   Left |   Right |   Similarity | Left Value              | Right Value          |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
|      0 |       0 |     0.689429 | Introduction            | Abstract             |
|      1 |       3 |     0.403029 | Mathematical Methods    | Theoretical Modeling |
|      2 |       1 |     0.504316 | Empirical Validation    | Experimental Results |
|      3 |       4 |     0.415846 | Anticipating Criticisms | Limitations          |
|      4 |       2 |     0.478649 | Future Work             | Proposed Extensions  |

Jellyjoin also provides some rudimentary utilities for visualizing these associations:

```python
from jellyjoin.plots import plot_associations

plot_associations(association_df)
```

```python
from jellyjoin.plots import plot_similarity_matrix

plot_similarity_matrix(similarity_matrix)
```

## Intermediate Usage

Often, though, your records will have multiple fields, so `jellyjoin` is designed to work
on Pandas DataFrames.

Let's say we have a list of database columns:

| Column Name                  | Type           |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| user.email                   | text           |
| user.touch_count             | integer        |
| user.propensity_score        | numeric        |
| user.ltv                     | numeric(10, 2) |
| user.purchase_count          | integer        |
| account.status_code          | char(1)        |
| account.age                  | integer        |
| account.total_purchase_count | integer        |

And we want to associate them to these front-end fields:

| Field Name                   | Type     |
|------------------------------|----------|
| Recent Touch Events          | number   |
| Total Touch Events           | number   |
| Account Age (Years)          | number   |
| User Propensity Score        | number   |
| Estimated Lifetime Value ($) | currency |
| Account Status               | string   |
| Number of Purchases          | number   |
| Freetext Notes               | string   |

We can do that by passing in the two dataframes. (The columns could be explicitly specified, but by default it uses the first column.)
Since some of the columns and fields *don't* match to anything, we'll also specify a threshold so that only "pretty good" matches or better
will be returned.

```python
jellyjoin.jellyjoin(left_df, right_df, threshold=0.4)
```

|   Left |   Right |   Similarity | Column Name             | Type_left      | Field Name                   | Type_right   |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------|
|      1 |       0 |     0.471828 | user.touch_count        | integer        | Recent Touch Events          | number       |
|      2 |       3 |     0.819823 | user.propensity_score   | numeric        | User Propensity Score        | number       |
|      3 |       4 |     0.476054 | user.ltv                | numeric(10, 2) | Estimated Lifetime Value ($) | currency     |
|      4 |       6 |     0.74174  | user.purchase_count     | integer        | Number of Purchases          | number       |
|      5 |       5 |     0.606886 | account.status_code     | char(1)        | Account Status               | string       |
|      6 |       2 |     0.556893 | account.age             | integer        | Account Age (Years)          | number       |

This only shows the single best match above a threshold of 0.4, which is useful if you want reliable, one-to-one matches. To include rows that didn't match
in the result, specify how you want to join: left, right, or outer. This options works the same was as the `how` option in `pandas.merge()`:

```python
jellyjoin.jellyjoin(left_df, right_df, threshold=0.4, how="outer")
```

|   Left |   Right |   Similarity | Column Name                  | Type_left      | Field Name                   | Type_right   |
|--------|---------|--------------|------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------|
|      0 |     nan |   nan        | user.email                   | text           | nan                          | nan          |
|      1 |       0 |     0.471828 | user.touch_count             | integer        | Recent Touch Events          | number       |
|      2 |       3 |     0.819823 | user.propensity_score        | numeric        | User Propensity Score        | number       |
|      3 |       4 |     0.475964 | user.ltv                     | numeric(10, 2) | Estimated Lifetime Value ($) | currency     |
|      4 |       6 |     0.741805 | user.purchase_count          | integer        | Number of Purchases          | number       |
|      5 |       5 |     0.606886 | account.status_code          | char(1)        | Account Status               | string       |
|      6 |       2 |     0.556831 | account.age                  | integer        | Account Age (Years)          | number       |
|      7 |     nan |   nan        | account.total_purchase_count | integer        | nan                          | nan          |
|    nan |       1 |   nan        | nan                          | nan            | Total Touch Events           | number       |
|    nan |       7 |   nan        | nan                          | nan            | Freetext Notes               | string       |

These join types show the missing rows, but they are still orphaned (not joined to anything) because by default the algorithm only takes
the single best match. These results will show `nan` values (Panda's equivalent of NULL in SQL) for columns on the other side of the join.

To get one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many matches, specify the `allow_many` option: left, right, or both.

```python
jellyjoin.jellyjoin(left_df, right_df, threshold=0.4, how="outer", allow_many="both")
```

Records that don't join to anything on the other side (with a similarity greater than the threshold) will still be left unjoined.
