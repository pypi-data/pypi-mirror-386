    MetadataFiltersContainer class that includes a metadata_filters list that works
    in the following way:
    A list of filters where:
    - each filter can be a block or allow filter
    - each filter can optionally filter: project, dataset, table and table_type
    - each filter matches using of the following types: exact match, regular expression, prefix
    - there's a default effect (allow/block) configured in the list, those elements with no matching
      filter will be resolved with the default effect in the list.
    - This class supports filtering objects in memory or generating SQL conditions for filtering,
      for SQL generation an encoder function is required that maps the different filter types to
      SQL, also a dictionary mapping from property name to column name is required (for example to
      map 'project' to 'database' or 'dataset' to 'schema'.
    - The order in which elements are added to the list is not relevant, priority is assigned based
      on the effect, rules with the default effect have the higher priority and stop the iteration.

    Filtering works by prioritizing "explicit" filters, a filter is considered explicit when it is
    configured with the same effect used as the default in the list.
    Let's suppose we have the following sample data:
    - prj_1: ds_1, ds_2
    - prj_2: ds_1, ds_2, ds_3
    - project_3: dataset_1, ds_2
    _ project_4: dataset_4

    These are examples using the sample data above:
    - list(default=allow): block(prj_*), allow(prj_1)
        - will allow prj_1 and all those projects not matching prj_*
        - allowed: (prj_1, all datasets), (project_3, all datasets), (project_4, all datasets)
    - list(default=block): allow(prj_*), block(prj_1)
        - will allow only prj_* except prj_1 that is explicitly blocked
        - allowed: (prj_2, all datasets)
    - list(default=allow): allow(*), block(prj_1)
        - will allow everything, allow(*) is considered a explicit rule and has the highest priority
        - allowed: everything
    - list(default=allow): block(*), allow(prj_1)
        - will allow only prj_1
        - allowed: (prj_1, all datasets)
    - list(default=allow): block(*, ds_*)
        - will block all datasets named ds_*
        - allowed: (project_3, dataset_1), (project_4, all datasets)
    - list(default=allow): allow(prj_2, ds_3), block(*, ds_*)
        - will block all datasets named ds_3 except for ds_3 in prj_2 that is explicitly allowed.
          Please note order is not relevant and the result would be exactly the same for:
            block(*, ds_*), allow(prj_2, ds_3)
        - allowed: (prj_2, ds_3), (project_3, dataset_1), (project_4, all datasets)
    - list(default=block): allow(*, dataset_*):
        - only datasets named dataset_* will be allowed
        - allowed: (project_3, dataset_1), (project_4, dataset_4)
