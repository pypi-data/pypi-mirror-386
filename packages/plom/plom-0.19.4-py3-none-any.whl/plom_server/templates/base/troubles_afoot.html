                    <p>If you are here then it is because someone isn't doing sufficient error handling.</p>
                    <p>Generally this is a bug.  Some non-mutually exclusive ideas of what happened:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Multiple users are doing things simultaneously.</li>
                        <li>Perhaps you have two tabs open and are maniacally clicking around in both.</li>
                        <li>HTMX was somehow involved and it has no catch-all?  Issue #3251</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you're seeing this instead of a Server 500 error or similar,
                        it is possible&mdash;perhaps even likely&mdash;that useful information is available in the server log
                        but we cannot show you that because AJAXy nonsense is likely afoot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please go back somewhere and try something again, consult an oracle,
                        make a small sacrifice, or otherwise help us fix this.
