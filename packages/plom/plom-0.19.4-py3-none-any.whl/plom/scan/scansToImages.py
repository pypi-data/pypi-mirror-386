    We have various ways to do this, in rough order of preference:

    1. Extract a scanned bitmap "as-is"
    2. Render the page with PyMuPDF
    3. Render the page with Ghostscript

    The bitmaps will have some metadata written into them to prevent
    otherwise identical pages from producing images with identical
    hashes.  See Issue #1573.

    Args:
        file_name (str, Path): PDF file from which to extract bitmaps.
        dest (str, Path): where to save the resulting bitmap files.
            Must exist.

    Keyword Args:
        do_not_extract (bool): always render, do not extract even if
            it seems possible to do so.  This is off-by-default until
            we are confident extracting won't miss anything.
            See more detailed description in the user-facing command-line
            tool `plom-scan`.
        debug_jpeg (bool): make jpegs, randomly rotated of various
            quality settings, for debugging or demos.  Default: False.
        add_metadata (bool): add invisible metadata to each image
            including bundle name and random numbers.  Default: True.
            If you disable this, you can get two identical images
            (from different pages) giving identical hashes, which
            in theory is harmless but at least in 2022 was causing
            database/client issues.

        TypeError: not a PDF, but it can be opened by PyMuPDF.
        ValueError: unrealistically tall skinny or very wide pages.

    For extracting the scanned data as is, we must be careful not to
    just grab any image off the page (for example, it must be the only
    image on the page, and it must not have any annotations on top of
    it).  There are various other conditions; if any of them fail, we
    fall back on rendering with PyMuPDF.

    If the above fail, we fall back on calling Ghostscript as a
    subprocess (the `gs` binary).  TODO: NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.

    Process each page of a pdf file into bitmaps.

    everything else darker.  Improves images when students write in very
    light pencil.

            Always true no matter what you specify (feature removed).

            render each page.  If `False`, images still may not be
            extracted: there are a variety of sanity checks that must

            noise, lower-quality jpegs, etc.  Default: False
