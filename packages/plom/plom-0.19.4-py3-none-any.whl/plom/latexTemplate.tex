% Use the command below to put a vfill between things when printing
% without answers/solutions. No space when printing with answers/solns
\newcommand{\blank}{ \ifprintanswers{}\else{\vfill}\fi }

% Use the command below to put a blankpage when printing without answers/solutions.
% No page when printing with answers/solns
% This takes an optional argument of a question-number: \blankpage[X]
% and prints a message telling the student that this blank space is for
% question X. If no arg given then it prints the same message but for
% the current question. Thanks to PDL for improving this.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The test consists of \numpages\ pages and \numquestions\ questions worth a total of \numpoints\ marks.
  \item This is a closed-book examination. \textbf{None of the following are allowed}: documents, cheat sheets or electronic devices of any kind (including calculators, phones, smart watches, etc.)
  \item No work on this page will be marked.
  \item Fill in the information below before turning to the questions.

% this page consists of instructions and formulas,
% so we use the dnm command to print a message to students
% telling them that nothing on this page will be marked.

\subsection*{Additional instructions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Please use the spaces indicated.
  \item If you require extra paper then put up your hand and ask your instructor.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item You must put your name and student number on any extra pages.
    \item You must indicate the test-number and question-number.
    \item Please do this \textbf{on both sides} of any extra pages.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Please do not dismember your test. You must submit all pages.
  \item Smoking is strictly prohibited during the test.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Formula sheet}
You may find the following formulas useful in the questions that follow.
\begin{align*}
  a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \\
  e^{i\pi}+1 &= 0 \\
  \sum_{i=1}^n i &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\
  \diff{}{x}(f+g) &= \diff{f}{x}+\diff{g}{x} \\
  \int (f+g)\dee{x} &= \int f \dee{x} + \int g \dee{x} \\
  \cos(a+b) &= \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b \\
  \sin(a+b) &= \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b \\
  A \cup (B \cap C) &= (A\cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \\
  A \cap (B \cup C) &= (A\cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \\
  \overline{A \cap B} &= \overline{A} \cup \overline{B} \\
  \overline{A \cup B} &= \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}

\begin{questions}
\question[5] Please place your answers in the boxes provided.
\begin{parts}
  \part Find the derivative of $\sin(x^2 y^3)$ with respect to $x$.
  \answerbox{$2xy^3 \cos(x^2 y^3)$}
  \begin{solution}
    We calculate the partial derivative.
    We also need the chain rule.
  \end{solution}
  \blank
  % Use \blank to space out the question parts nicely.

  \part Another little thing here.
  \answerbox{\(\sin(x)\)}
  \begin{solution}
    Putting in your solutions ahead of time really helps calibrate your test.
  \end{solution}
  \blank  % more spacing

  \part A third thing
  \answerbox{\(\int \sin(x) dx\)}
  \begin{solution}
    Yet another solution goes here.
    \[ \int \sin(x) dx = -\cos(x) + C\]
  Note--- (-1) if no \(+C\)
  \end{solution}
  \blank % and yet more spacing.
\end{parts}

%% Next question

\question[5]
Please place your answers in the boxes provided.
\begin{parts}
  \part Answer something not quite so simple
  \answerbox{ABC}
  \begin{solution}
    Some working will go here. Like the question, the solution will not be so simple and may span several lines, and have some rubric information for the marker to use.
  \end{solution}
  \blank
  % Use \blank to space out the question parts nicely.

  \part Another less simple thing here.
  \answerbox{\(\sin(x)\)}
  \begin{solution}
    Putting in your solutions ahead of time really helps calibrate your test. If the answer is \(\sin(x)\) what was the question?
  \end{solution}
  \blank

  \part A third thing unsimple thing here.
  \answerbox{\(\int \sin(x) dx\)}
  \begin{solution}
    Yet another solution goes here. This one looks similar to a previous solution. Maybe there is a subtle difference in the solution which we should really make very clear to the grader (and student) here.
  \end{solution}
  \blank
\end{parts}
\newpage

%% Next question

\question[10] A long question goes here. In fact it is sufficiently long that we make sure you have a whole extra blank page for your work.
\begin{solution}
  A long solution here. Maybe it even contains a diagram? A careful diagram is a beautiful thing.
\end{solution}

% The command below creates a blank page and will print a message 
% telling students that the space is for the current question.
