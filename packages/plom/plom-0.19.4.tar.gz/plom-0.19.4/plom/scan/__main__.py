"""Plom tools for scanning tests and pushing to servers.

See help for each subcommand or consult online documentation for an
overview of the steps in setting up a server.

Most subcommands communicate with a server, which can be specified
on the command line or by setting environment variables PLOM_SERVER
and PLOM_MANAGER_PASSWORD.

## Overview of the scanning process

  1. Decide on a working directory for your scans, copy your PDFs into
     that directory and then cd into it.

  2. Use the `process` command to split your first PDF into bitmaps of
     each page.  This will also read any QR codes from the pages and
     match these against expectations from the server.

  3. Use the `upload` command to send pages to the server.  There are
     additional flags for dealing with special cases:

       a. Pages that could not be identified are called "Unknowns".
          They can include "Extra Pages" without QR codes, poor-quality
          scans where the QR reader failed, folded papers, etc.  A small
          number is normal but large numbers are cause for concern and
          sanity checking.  A human will (eventually) have to identify
          these manually.

       b. If the system detects you trying to upload a test page
          corresponding to one already in the system (but not identical)
          then those pages are filed as "Collisions". If you have good
          paper-handling protocols then this should not happen, except
          in exceptional circumstances (such as rescanning an illegible
          page).  Force the upload these if you really need to; the
          manager will then have to look at them.

  4. Run "plom-scan status" to get a summary of scanning to date.

  5. If something goes wrong such as crashes or interruptions, you may
     need to clear the "scanner" login with the `clear` command.

  These steps may be repeated as new PDF files come in: it is not
  necessary to wait until scanning is complete to start processing and
  uploading.

            We recommend this option if you scanned the papers yourself.
            If a PDF page seems to contain exactly one bitmap image and
            nothing else, then extract that losslessly instead of rendering
            the page as a new PNG file.  This will be MUCH FASTER and will
            typically give nicer images for the common case where pages are
            simply JPEG/PNG images embedded in a PDF file.  But some care
            must be taken that the image is not annotated in any way and
            that no other markings appear on the page.
            If the papers were produced by other people, this option is NOT
            RECOMMENDED, in case it misses markings made on top of a bitmap
            base (e.g., from annotation software).
            For this reason, it is not yet the default.
