as a reference. The template should be a Jinja2 template
file with the `.html.j2` extension.

The template has access to the following variables:

- `notebooks`: List of Notebook objects for HTML notebooks
- `notebooks_wasm`: List of Notebook objects for WebAssembly notebooks
- `apps`: List of Notebook objects for apps

Each Notebook object has the following properties:

- `display_name`: The display name of the notebook
- `html_path`: The path to the exported HTML file
