## What is Claude Worktree?

**claude-worktree** (or `cw` for short) is a CLI tool that makes it effortless to work on multiple git branches simultaneously using git worktrees, with automatic Claude Code integration. No more branch switching, stashing changes, or losing context‚Äîeach feature gets its own directory and Claude session.

### Key Features

- üå≥ **Easy Worktree Management**: Create isolated directories for each feature branch
- ü§ñ **Claude Code Integration**: Automatically launch Claude Code in each worktree
- üîÑ **Clean Merge Workflow**: Rebase, merge, and cleanup with a single command
- üì¶ **Simple Naming**: Use clean branch names without timestamp clutter
- ‚ö° **Shell Completion**: Tab completion for bash/zsh/fish
- üéØ **Type-Safe**: Built with type hints and modern Python practices

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install claude-worktree
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install claude-worktree
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaveDev42/claude-worktree.git
cd claude-worktree
uv pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a new feature worktree

```bash
cw new fix-auth
```

This will:
- Create a new branch named `fix-auth`
- Create a worktree at `../myproject-fix-auth/`
- Launch Claude Code in that directory

### 2. Work on your feature

Make changes, commit them, and test your code in the isolated worktree.

### 3. Finish and merge

```bash
cw finish --push
```

This will:
- Rebase your feature onto the base branch
- Fast-forward merge into the base branch
- Clean up the worktree and feature branch
- Optionally push to remote with `--push`

## Usage

### Create a new worktree

```bash
# Create from current branch
cw new feature-name

# Specify base branch
cw new fix-bug --base develop

# Custom path
cw new hotfix --path /tmp/urgent-fix

# Skip Claude launch
cw new refactor --no-claude

# Launch Claude in iTerm (macOS)
cw new feature --iterm

# Launch Claude in tmux
cw new feature --tmux my-session
```

### List worktrees

```bash
cw list
```

Output:
```
Worktrees for repository: /Users/dave/myproject

BRANCH                              STATUS     PATH
refs/heads/main                     clean      .
refs/heads/fix-auth                 active     ../myproject-fix-auth
refs/heads/feature-api              clean      ../myproject-feature-api
```

### Show status

```bash
cw status
```

### Reattach Claude Code

```bash
cw attach
```

### Delete a worktree

```bash
# Delete by branch name
cw delete fix-auth

# Delete by path
cw delete ../myproject-old-feature

# Keep branch, only remove worktree
cw delete feature --keep-branch

# Also delete remote branch
cw delete feature --delete-remote
```

### Prune stale worktrees

```bash
cw prune
```

## Command Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cw new <name>` | Create new worktree with specified branch name |
| `cw finish` | Rebase, merge, and cleanup current worktree |
| `cw attach` | Reattach Claude Code to current worktree |
| `cw list` | List all worktrees |
| `cw status` | Show current worktree status |
| `cw delete <target>` | Delete worktree by branch name or path |
| `cw prune` | Prune stale worktree data |

## Shell Completion

Enable shell completion for better productivity:

```bash
# Install completion for your shell
cw --install-completion

# Restart your shell or source your config
```

Now you can use tab completion:
```bash
cw <TAB>          # Shows available commands
cw new --<TAB>    # Shows available options
```

## Configuration

### Default Behavior

By default, `cw new <branch>` creates worktrees at:
```
../<repo-name>-<branch-name>/
```

For example, if your repository is at `/Users/dave/myproject` and you run `cw new fix-auth`:
- Worktree path: `/Users/dave/myproject-fix-auth/`
- Branch name: `fix-auth` (no timestamp)

### Claude Code Options

- `--no-claude`: Skip launching Claude Code
- `--bg`: Launch Claude in background
- `--iterm`: Launch in new iTerm window (macOS only)
- `--tmux <name>`: Launch in new tmux session

## Requirements

- **Git**: Version 2.31 or higher
- **Python**: 3.11 or higher
- **Claude CLI** (optional): For automatic Claude Code integration

## How It Works

### Metadata Storage

`claude-worktree` stores metadata in git config:

```bash
# Stores base branch for feature branches
git config branch.<feature>.worktreeBase <base>

# Stores path to main repository
git config worktree.<feature>.basePath <path>
```

This allows the `finish` command to know:
1. Which branch to rebase onto
2. Where the main repository is located
3. How to safely perform the merge

### Workflow Example

1. **Start**: You're on `main` branch in `/Users/dave/myproject`
2. **Create**: Run `cw new fix-auth`
   - Creates branch `fix-auth` from `main`
   - Creates worktree at `/Users/dave/myproject-fix-auth/`
   - Launches Claude Code
3. **Work**: Make changes and commit in the worktree
4. **Finish**: Run `cw finish --push`
   - Rebases `fix-auth` onto `main`
   - Merges into `main` with fast-forward
   - Removes worktree and branch
   - Pushes to `origin/main`

## Troubleshooting

### "Not a git repository"

Make sure you're running commands from within a git repository.

### "Claude CLI not found"

Install Claude Code CLI from: https://claude.ai/download

Or use `--no-claude` flag to skip Claude integration.

### "Rebase failed"

Conflicts were detected during rebase. The tool automatically aborts the rebase. Resolve conflicts manually:

```bash
cd <worktree-path>
git rebase origin/<base-branch>
# Resolve conflicts
git rebase --continue
# Then run: cw finish
```

### Shell completion not working

1. Install completion: `cw --install-completion`
2. Restart your shell or source your config file
3. If still not working, check your shell's completion system is enabled
