    f"""Construct a circuit for testing the performance of a code as a quantum memory.

    In a nutshell, the circuit constructed by this method performs (generally multiple) rounds
    quantum error correction (QEC) for the given code.  Each round of QEC measures all parity checks
    of the code, and detectors are added to enforce that
    (a) the syndrome from the first round of QEC is trivial, and
    (b) every subsequent round of QEC yields the same syndrome as the preceding round.
    We refer to num_rounds rounds of syndrome measurement as one logical QEC cycle.

    If the basis is Pauli.X or Pauli.Z, then the memory experiment only tracks errors in the logical
    Pauli operators of that type.  If basis is None, the circuit entangles the code with a noiseless
    ancilla to track errors in all logical Pauli operators.

    More specifically, if basis is Pauli.X or Pauli.Z then the memory experiment performs the
    following:
    1. Initialize all data qubits to a +1 eigenstate of the specified basis: |0> for Z, |+> for X.
    2. Perform an initial round of QEC, adding detectors for the basis-type stabilizers.
    3. Perform num_rounds - 1 additional QEC rounds, adding detectors to enforce that basis-type
        stabilizers have not changed between adjacent rounds of QEC.
    4. Measure all data qubits in the specified basis.
    5. Add detectors for all stabilizers that can be inferred from the data qubit measurements.
    If a noise_model is provided, then noise is added to all parts of the circuit.

    If basis is None, then the memory experiment noiselesly initializes each logical qubit of the
    code in a maximally entangled state with an (unphysical) noiseless ancilla qubit before running
    a noisy logical QEC cycle.  This initialization makes it possible to meaningfully track errors
    in both X-type and Z-type logical operators of a code.  The probability of an error in any
    logical operator is then essentially the process infidelity (or entanglement infidelity) of the
    logical QEC cycle.

    More specifically, if basis is None then the memory experiment performs the following:
    1. Prepare a logical all-|0> state of the code.
    2. For each logical qubit of the code, prepare an ancilla qubit in |+>, and apply an
        ancilla-controlled-logical-NOT gate to the logical qubit, thereby preparing Bell states
        |00> + |11> of logical qubits with their respective ancillas.
    3. Perform a logical QEC cycle as before, but now adding detectors for all stabilizers.
    4. Measure all stabilizers (with MPP gates).
    Unlike the fixed-basis experiment, the combined basis experiment only makes sense when starting
    from the Bell state.  It is also no longer possible to measure out all data qubits to infer all
    stabilizers.  Initialization and readout (measuring final stabilizers) are therefore noiseless.
    If a noise_model is provided, then noise is added to the logical QEC cycle alone.  Otherwise,
    the initialization and readout sub-circuits are wrapped in a single-repetition
    stim.CircuitRepeatBlock tagged with "{DEFAULT_IMMUNE_OP_TAG}" to indicate that these
    sub-circuits should be immune to noise.

    Remembering that observables in Stim are formally detectors, or circuit-level parity checks that
    must evaluate to 0 in the absence of errors, the preparation of Bell pairs allows us to annotate
    XX and ZZ observables for each Bell pair.  Here one of the "X"s in XX is a logical X for a
    logical qubit of the code, and the other "X" is a physical X on an associated ancilla qubit;
    likewise with ZZ.  Since the ancilla qubit is noiseless, we can attribute an error in XX or ZZ to
    a logical qubit error.

    Having said all of that, we do not actually annotate memory simulation circuits with the XX and
    ZZ observables described above.  Instead, we recognize that Bell-pair XX and ZZ operators are
    exact stabilizers of the circuit immediately after noiseless initialization, which allows us to
    freely multiply the XX and ZZ operators at the end of the circuit by XX and ZZ operators before
    the logical QEC cycle, thereby obtaining two-time XXXX and ZZZZ observables.  The chief (albeit
    perhaps aesthetic) benefit to this trick is that the support of these observables on the
    (noiseless) ancilla qubits cancels out, leaving us with two-time logical XX and ZZ observables
    supported on the data qubits alone.

    Qubits and detectors are assigned coordinates as follows:
    - The data qubit addressed by column C of the parity check matrix gets coordinate (0, C).
    - The check qubit associated with row R of the parity check matrix gets coordinate (1, R).
    - The ancilla qubit associated with logical qubit L of the code gets coordinate (2, L).
    - The K-th detector in measurement round M gets coordinate (M, 0, K).

    Args:
        code: An error-correcting code.  Must be a qubit stabilizer (non-subsystem) codes.  If
            passed a classical code, treat it as a quantum CSS code that protects only basis-type
            logical operators (or X-type logicals, if basis is None).
        basis: Should be Pauli.X, Pauli.Z, or None to indicate which type of logical operators to
            track (where "None" means "both X and Z").  Default: Pauli.X.
        num_rounds: The number of syndome measurement rounds to perform in one logical QEC cycle.
            Must be at least 1.  Default: 1.
        noise_model: The noise model to apply to the circuit after construction, or None to return a
            noiseless circuit.  Default: None.
        qubit_ids: A QubitIDs object specifying the index of data and check qubits.  Defaults to
            labeling data and check qubits according to their correspnding column/row of the parity
            check matrix, with data qubits numbered from 0 and check qubits numbered from len(code).
        syndrome_measurement_strategy: The syndrome measurement strategy that defines how each
            round of QEC measures the parity checks of the code.  Default: circuits.EdgeColoring().

    Returns:
        stim.Circuit: A circuit ready for simulation via Stim or Sinter.
