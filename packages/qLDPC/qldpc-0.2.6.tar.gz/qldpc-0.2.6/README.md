# qLDPC

This library contains tools for constructing and analyzing [quantum low density parity check (qLDPC) codes](https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/qldpc).  At least, that was the original motivation for this library.  In practice, the tools here work just as well for stabilizer and subsystem codes more broadly.

In a nutshell, `qLDPC` provides methods to build a variety of built-in and custom codes, represented under the hood by a parity check matrix.  Once a code is constructed, `qLDPC` automates various tasks of common interest, integrating with a variety of external tools (including [`ldpc`](https://github.com/quantumgizmos/ldpc), [`stim`](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim), [`sinter`](https://pypi.org/project/sinter), [`QDistRnd`](https://docs.gap-system.org/pkg/qdistrnd/doc/chap1_mj.html), and [`MAGMA`](https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma), among others).  Automated tasks include:
- constructing a code from a variety of code families,
- constructing a canonical basis of logical Pauli operators,
- computing (or upper-bounding) code distance,
- computing logical error rates in a code-capacity model,
- constructing various circuits of interest, such as a quantum memory experiment for obtaining circuit-level logical error rates,
- defining custom Pauli noise models,
- plugging a decoder of choice into your workflow.

See the [`examples`](https://github.com/qLDPCOrg/qLDPC/tree/main/examples) directory for some demonstrations and use-cases.

Where possible, this library strives to support codes over arbitrary finite (Galois) fields -- that is, for qudits of any prime power dimension.  Circuit-related utilities are, however, limited to qubit codes.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

This library requires Python>=3.10, and can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) with
```
pip install qldpc
```

To install a local version of qLDPC from source:
```
git clone https://github.com/qLDPCOrg/qLDPC.git
pip install -e qLDPC
```
You can also `pip install -e 'qLDPC[dev]'` to additionally install some development tools.

### GAP

Some features in `qLDPC` require an installation of the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org) computer algebra system.  If you (a) use linux or macOS, and (b) use a `conda` to manage your python environment, then you can obtain GAP by running `conda install -c conda-forge gap` (or `gap-core`).  Installations without `conda` should also work, as long as `gap` is a recognized command in the command line.  Unfortunately, [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org) integration is clunky in Windows because I have not figured out how to call [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org) from the Windows command prompt.  If you figure this out, [please let me know](https://github.com/qLDPCOrg/qLDPC/issues/294)!

### macOS

If you use macOS you may need to install `cvxpy` manually by following the instructions [here](https://www.cvxpy.org/install) before installing `qLDPC`.  If you use `conda` to manage your python environment, you can obtain `cvxpy` by running `conda install -c conda-forge cvxpy`.

## ðŸ¤” Questions and issues

This project aspires to one day have a proper [documentation page](https://qldpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest).  In the meantime, I recommend looking at source code and the detailed comments therein, as well as `help(qldpc.object_of_interest)`.  `qLDPC` requires every file (such as [`qldpc/codes/quantum.py`](https://github.com/qLDPCOrg/qLDPC/blob/main/qldpc/codes/quantum.py)) to be covered by its own test file (such as [`qldpc/codes/quantum_test.py`](https://github.com/qLDPCOrg/qLDPC/blob/main/qldpc/codes/quantum_test.py)), so test files are a good place to look for example usage of any function, class, etc.  Finally, the [`examples`](https://github.com/qLDPCOrg/qLDPC/tree/main/examples) directory has some helpful notebooks to get you started.

If you have any questions, feedback, or requests, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/qLDPCOrg/qLDPC/issues/new) or email me at [mika.perlin@gmail.com](mailto:mika.perlin@gmail.com)!
