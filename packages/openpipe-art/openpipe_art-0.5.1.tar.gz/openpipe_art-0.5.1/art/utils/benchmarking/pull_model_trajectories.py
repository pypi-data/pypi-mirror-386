    This is a lightweight helper that mirrors the S3-sync logic used inside
    ``art_e.train`` but without performing any training.  It can be invoked from
    notebooks or other scripts to ensure that the local ART project directory
    contains all trajectory files for subsequent evaluation / analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : art.Model
        Any ART model instance (trainable or not) that should be synchronised.

    Environment
    -----------
    BACKUP_BUCKET : str
        Name of the S3 bucket that stores model artefacts. The variable is
