# Risk Management Framework -  A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy
# ASD - https://www.cyber.gov.au/ism/oscal/v2024.10.4
# By developing an event logging policy, taking into consideration any shared responsibilities
# between service providers and their customers, an organisation can improve their chances of
# detecting malicious behaviour on their systems.
# In doing so, an event logging policy should cover details of events to be logged,
# event logging facilities to be used, how event logs will be monitored and how long
# to retain event logs."

# This publication describes the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and provides
# guidelines for applying the RMF to information systems and organizations.
#
# The RMF provides a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for
# managing security and privacy risk that includes information security categorization;
# control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and common control authorizations;
# and continuous monitoring.
#
# The RMF includes activities to prepare organizations to execute the framework at appropriate
# risk management levels.
#
# The RMF also promotes near real-time risk management and ongoing information system
# and common control authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring processes;
# provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make efficient,
# cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions and
# business functions; and incorporates security and privacy into the system development life cycle.
# Executing the RMF tasks links essential risk management processes at the system
# level to risk management processes at the organization level.
#
# In addition, it establishes responsibility and accountability for the controls
# implemented within an organizationâ€™s information systems and inherited by those systems.
