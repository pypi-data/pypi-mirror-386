"""
This module provides Python generator utilities for use within the Wattleflow
framework. It includes methods for generating numeric sequences, random data
records, and segmented text streams based on configurable patterns.


Example 1: Generator counter from 1 to a given range
    from wattleflow.helpers.generators import inc, text_generator, records

    counter = inc()
    for _ in range(5):
        print(next(counter))
    # result: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Example 2: Generator split text into sentences

    text = "This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence! And finally third sentence?"
    for part in text_generator(text):
        print(part)
    Result:
    This is the first sentence
    This is the second sentence! And finally third sentence
    This is the second sentence! And finally third sentence

Example 3: Generate randomm values
    data = records(5)
    print(data)

    Result:
    List of 5 random numbers between 0 and 1
