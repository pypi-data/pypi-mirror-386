# Will Pushing Code Publish to PyPI?

## ❌ SHORT ANSWER: NO

Simply pushing code to the repository will **NOT** automatically publish to PyPI.

---

## 📋 WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS

### When You Push Code to `main` or `develop`

```
git push origin main
        ↓
CI Workflow Runs (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
        ↓
✓ Linting (black, isort, flake8)
✓ Type checking (mypy)
✓ Unit tests (pytest)
✓ Package built (uv build)
✓ Package validated (twine check)
        ↓
❌ NOT published to PyPI
```

**Result**: Tests run, package is built and validated, but it stays in your repository.

## ✅ HOW TO PUBLISH TO PyPI

You must explicitly create a **GitHub Release** or push a **git tag**.

### Method 1: Using Git Commands (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Update version in pyproject.toml
nano pyproject.toml
# Change: version = "0.0.4"

# 2. Commit the version change
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "Bump version to 0.0.4"
git push origin main

# 3. Create and push the tag
git tag v0.0.4
git push origin v0.0.4

# 4. Monitor at GitHub Actions
# The "Publish to PyPI" workflow will automatically run
```

### Method 2: Using GitHub UI

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **"Releases"** → **"Create a new release"**
3. Enter tag: `v0.0.4`
4. Enter title: `Release v0.0.4`
5. Add release notes describing changes
6. Click **"Publish release"**

## 🔍 YOUR WORKFLOW FILES

### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to `main`/`develop`, pull requests
- **Actions**: Tests, linting, type checking, build
- **Result**: ❌ Does NOT publish

### Publish Workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Only on git tags (`refs/tags/*`)
- **Condition**: `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')`
- **Actions**: Build and upload to PyPI
- **Result**: ✅ Publishes to PyPI

## 📦 CURRENT STATUS

- **Current Version**: 0.0.3
- **Status**: Already published on PyPI
- **Next Version**: 0.0.4 (ready when you decide)
- **PyPI URL**: https://pypi.org/project/egnyte-langchain-connector/

## 🚀 PUBLISHING CHECKLIST

Before publishing, ensure:

- [ ] All code changes are committed and pushed to `main`
- [ ] CI workflow passed (all tests green)
- [ ] Version updated in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] Git tag matches version (v0.0.4 = version 0.0.4)

Then:

- [ ] Create git tag: `git tag v0.0.4`
- [ ] Push tag: `git push origin v0.0.4`
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions
- [ ] Verify on PyPI after 5-10 minutes

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Version Consistency**: Tag and version must match
   - Tag: `v0.0.4`
   - Version in `pyproject.toml`: `0.0.4`

2. **CI Must Pass**: Publishing only happens if tests pass

3. **One Release Per Version**: Cannot republish same version

4. **Semantic Versioning**: Use format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

5. **Trusted Publishing**: Uses OIDC (no API tokens needed)

---

## 🔐 SECURITY

Your workflow uses **Trusted Publishing**:
- ✓ No API tokens stored in GitHub secrets
- ✓ Uses OIDC for authentication
- ✓ More secure than traditional API tokens
- ✓ Recommended by PyPI

## 📝 SUMMARY

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Push code to main | Tests run, NOT published |
| Push code to develop | Tests run, NOT published |
| Create pull request | Tests run, NOT published |
| Push git tag | ✅ **Published to PyPI** |
| Create GitHub Release | ✅ **Published to PyPI** |

**Bottom Line**: You must explicitly create a release or tag to publish. Pushing code alone will not publish to PyPI.

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

When you're ready to publish v0.0.4:

```bash
# Update version
echo 'version = "0.0.4"' >> pyproject.toml

# Commit and push
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "Bump version to 0.0.4"
git push origin main

# Create and push tag
git tag v0.0.4
git push origin v0.0.4

# Check GitHub Actions for publishing status
# Verify on PyPI after 5-10 minutes
```
