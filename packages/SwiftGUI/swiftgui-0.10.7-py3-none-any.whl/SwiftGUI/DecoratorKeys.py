    This decorator will "extend the main loop".
    When the main loop receives the passed key, the decorated function is called, roughly equivalent to

        ...

        if e == key:
            my_function(...)
            continue

    The decorated function may accept the following parameters, simmilar to key-functions:
    w     - Window (useful for changing elements)
    e     - Event-key (Will be the same every time in this case)
    v     - Value-"dict"
