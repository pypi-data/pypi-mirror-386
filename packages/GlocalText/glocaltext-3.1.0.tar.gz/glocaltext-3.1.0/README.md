## Introduction

GlocalText is a powerful command-line tool that automates text translation using a highly intuitive, **firewall-style `rules` system**. It processes text by evaluating a list of rules from top to bottom, giving you precise, predictable control over your localization workflow.

At its core, the logic is simple: **for most actions, the first rule that matches wins**. When GlocalText extracts a piece of text, it checks your `rules` one by one. For terminating actions like `skip` or `replace`, it executes the first matching rule and immediately stops processing for that text.

However, actions like `protect` and `modify` behave differently, allowing for **chainable pre-processing**. These rules will alter the text and then pass the _modified_ text back into the rules engine. This allows subsequent rules (including other `protect` or `modify` rules) to act on the text before it is finally sent for translation, enabling powerful, step-by-step text manipulation.

This design offers several key advantages:

1.  **Predictable Control**: You know exactly which rule will apply. There's no complex logic to manage—just a straightforward, top-down priority list.
2.  **Flexible Matching**: Define how a rule identifies text. You can use `exact` for a perfect match or `contains` to find a substring. A `match` condition can be a **single string** or a **list of strings**, allowing for flexible `OR` logic.
3.  **Default Action**: If no rules match a piece of text, it is sent to the configured translation provider for automated translation.

This unified, firewall-inspired `rules` engine provides a clear and powerful way to manage your entire translation workflow, from protecting brand names to providing authoritative manual translations.

## Key Features

-   **Unified Firewall `rules` Engine**: A single, powerful system to control your entire translation workflow.
-   **Top-Down Priority**: Rules are evaluated from top to bottom—the first rule that matches wins, providing predictable and precise control.
-   **Flexible Matching**: Match text with `exact` (full string), `contains` (substring), or `regex` (regular expression). The condition can be a single string or a list for flexible `OR` logic.
-   **Clear Actions**: Define clear actions:
    -   `skip`: A **terminating** action that protects the entire text block from being translated. Ideal for code blocks or content that should never be altered.
    -   `replace`: A **terminating** action that provides an authoritative, final translation for a text block, skipping the API entirely.
    -   `protect`: A **pre-processing** action that protects a specific segment (like a brand name or variable) _within_ a larger text block, allowing the rest of the text to be translated.
    -   `modify`: A **pre-processing** action that replaces a matched segment before passing the modified text back to the rules engine for further processing or translation. It supports regex capture groups for complex substitutions.
-   **Multiple Provider Support**: Configure and use different translation providers like Google Translate and Google Gemini.
-   **Task-Based Configuration**: Define multiple, independent translation tasks in a single configuration file.
-   **Glob Pattern Matching**: Precisely include or exclude files for translation using `glob` patterns.
-   **Flexible Output Control**: Choose to either modify original files directly (`in_place: true`) or create new, translated versions in a specified path (`in_place: false`).
-   **Incremental Translation**: Save time and cost by only translating new or modified content.

## Installation

```bash
pip install GlocalText
```

## Configuration (`glocaltext_config.yaml`)

This file is the control center for GlocalText. It consists of global settings and a list of `tasks`.

### Task Configuration

Each item in the `tasks` list defines a self-contained translation job with the following settings:

-   **`name`**: A unique name for the task.
-   **`source_lang`** & **`target_lang`**: The source and target language codes (e.g., "en", "zh-TW").
-   **`source`**: Defines which files to process.
    -   **`include`**: A list of `glob` patterns for files to translate.
    -   **`exclude`**: A list of `glob` patterns for files to skip.
-   **`extraction_rules`**: A list of regex patterns to extract translatable text.
-   **`incremental`**: A boolean (`true` or `false`) to enable or disable incremental translation. When enabled, only new or modified text is translated. Defaults to `false`.
-   **`cache_path`**: (Optional) A path to a directory where the task's cache file (`.glocaltext_cache.json`) will be stored.
-   **`output`**: Defines how translated files are written.
    -   **`in_place`**: If `true`, modifies original files. If `false`, writes to a new directory.
    -   **`path`**: The output directory. Required if `in_place` is `false`.
    -   **`filename`**: (Optional) A string template to define the output filename.
        -   Available placeholders: `{stem}`, `{ext}`, `{source_lang}`, `{target_lang}`.
        -   Example: `filename: "{stem}_{target_lang}{ext}"` results in `mydoc_zh-TW.md`.
        -   If `filename` is provided, `filename_suffix` is ignored.
    -   **`filename_suffix`**: (Legacy) A suffix to add to the output filenames (e.g., `_translated`).
-   **`rules`**: The firewall-style rules for text processing (see `skip`, `replace`, `protect`, `modify`).

### Specifying a Translator per Task

You can specify a particular translation provider for an individual task using the `translator` option. This allows you to mix and match providers (e.g., use 'gemini' for one task and 'google' for another).

If the specified translator is not available (e.g., missing API key), the system will log a warning and fall back to the default provider.

```yaml
tasks:
    - name: "Documentation"
      translator: "gemini"
      # ... other task settings
    - name: "Code Comments"
      translator: "google"
      # ... other task settings
```

### API Key Configuration

API keys are configured under the `providers` section. GlocalText follows a clear priority for API key resolution:

1.  **Environment Variable**: It will first check for a dedicated environment variable (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
2.  **Configuration File**: If the environment variable is not set, it will use the `api_key` specified in the `glocaltext_config.yaml` file.

This approach allows for flexibility in development (using the config file) and security in production (using environment variables).

## Usage

### Command-Line Options

-   `--config <path>` or `-c <path>`: Specifies the path to your `glocaltext_config.yaml` file. Defaults to `glocaltext_config.yaml` in the current directory.
-   `--debug [LOG_DIR_PATH]`: Enables detailed debug logging. If an optional directory path is provided, the debug log will be saved to `glocaltext_debug.log` inside that directory. Otherwise, debug information is printed to the console.
