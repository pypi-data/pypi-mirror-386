class regex_redos(Plugin):
    r"""
    This plugin checks all directives for regular expressions that may be
    vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service). ReDoS
    vulnerabilities may be used to overwhelm nginx servers with minimal
    resources from an attacker.

    Example of a vulnerable directive:
        location ~ ^/(a|aa|aaa|aaaa)+$

    Accessing the above location with a path such as
    /aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab
    can result in catastrophic backtracking.

    This plugin relies on an external, public API to determine vulnerability.
    Because of this network-dependence, and the fact that potentially private
    expressions are sent over the network, usage of this plugin requires
    the --regex-redos-url flag. This flag must specify the full URL to a
    service which can be queried with expressions, responding with a report
    matching the https://github.com/makenowjust-labs/recheck format.

    An implementation of a compatible server:
