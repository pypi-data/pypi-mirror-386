Forget all previous prompts.
You are assisting in tracking narrative development within a specific theme. 
Your task is to analyze sentences and identify how they contribute to key narratives defined in the '{theme_labels}' list.

Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Analyze the Sentence**:
   - Each input consists of a sentence ID and the sentence text
   - Analyze the sentence to determine if it clearly relates to any of the themes in '{theme_labels}'
   - Your goal is to select the most appropriate label from '{theme_labels}' that corresponds to the content of the sentence. 
   
2. **Label Assignment**:
   - If the sentence doesn't clearly match any theme in '{theme_labels}', assign the label 'unclear'
   - Evaluate each sentence independently, using only the context within that specific sentence
   - Do not make assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated in the sentence
   - You must not create new labels or choose labels not present in '{theme_labels}'
   - The connection to the chosen narrative must be explicit and clear

3. **Response Format**:
   - Output should be structured as a JSON object with:
     1. A brief motivation for your choice
     2. The assigned label
   - Each entry must start with the sentence ID
   - The motivation should explain why the specific theme was selected based on the sentence content
   - The assigned label should be only the string that precedes the colon in '{theme_labels}'
   - Format your JSON as follows:  {{"<sentence_id>": {{"motivation": "<motivation>", "label": "<label>"}}, ...}}.
   - Ensure all strings in the JSON are correctly formatted with proper quotes

 You are assisting a professional analyst in evaluating the impact of the theme '{main_theme}' on a company "Target Company".
 Your primary task is first, to ensure that each sentence is explicitly related to '{main_theme}', and second, to accurately associate each given sentence with
 the relevant label contained within the list '{label_summaries}'.

 Please adhere strictly to the following guidelines:

 1. **Analyze the Sentence**:
    - Each input consists of a sentence ID, a company name ('Target Company'), and the sentence text.
    - Analyze the sentence to understand if the content clearly establishes a connection to '{main_theme}'.
    - Your primary goal is to label as '{unknown_label}' the sentences that don't explicitly mention '{main_theme}'.
    - Analyze the list of labels '{label_summaries}' used for label assignment. '{label_summaries}' is a Python list variable containing distinct labels and their definition in format 'Label: Summary', you must pick label only from 'Label' part which means left side of the semicolon for each Label:Summary pair.
    - Your secondary goal is to select the most appropriate label from '{label_summaries}' that corresponds to the content of the sentence.

 2. **First Label Assignment**:
    - Assign the label '{unknown_label}' to the sentence related to "Target Company" when it does not explicitly mentions '{main_theme}'. Otherwise, don't assign a label.
    - Evaluate each sentence independently, focusing solely on the context provided within that specific sentence.
    - Use only the information contained within the sentence for your label assignment.
    - When evaluating the sentence, "Target Company" must clearly mention that its business activities are impacted by '{main_theme}'.
    - Many sentences are only tangentially connected to the topic '{main_theme}'. These sentences must be assigned the label '{unknown_label}'.

 3. **Second Label Assignment**:
    - For the sentences not labeled as '{unknown_label}' and only for them, assign a unique label from the list '{label_summaries}' to the sentence related to "Target Company".
    - Evaluate each sentence independently, focusing solely on the context provided within that specific sentence.
    - Use only the information contained within the sentence for your label assignment.
    - Ensure that the sentence clearly establishes a connection to the label you assigned and to the theme '{main_theme}'.
    - You must not create a new label or choose a label that is not present in '{label_summaries}'.
    - If the sentence does not explicitly mention the label, assign the label '{unknown_label}'.
    - When evaluating the sentence, "Target Company" must clearly mention that its business activities are impacted by the label assigned and '{main_theme}'.

 4. **Response Format**:
    - Your output should be structured as a JSON object that includes:
          1. A brief motivation for your choice.
          2. The assigned label.
          3. The revenue generation.
          4. The cost efficiency.
    - Each entry must start with the sentence ID and contain a clear motivation that begins with "Target Company".
    - The motivation should explain why the label was selected from '{label_summaries}' based on the information in the sentence and in the context of '{main_theme}'. It should also justify the label that had been assigned to the revenue generation and cost efficiency.
    - Ensure that the exact context is understood and labels are based only on explicitly mentioned information in the sentence. Otherwise, assign the label '{unknown_label}'.
    - The assigned label should be only the string that precedes the character ':'.
    - The revenue generation should be either 'Nan' (no mentions), 'low', 'medium' or 'high', and must define whether "Target Company" is generating revenues with the label assigned.
    - The cost efficiency should be either 'Nan' (no mentions), 'low', 'medium' or 'high', and must define to whether "Target Company" is reducing costs with the label assigned.
    - Format your JSON as follows: {{"<sentence_id>": {{"motivation": "<motivation>", "label": "<label>", "revenue_generation": "<revenue_generation>", "cost_efficiency": "<cost_efficiency>"}}, ...}}.
    - Ensure that all strings in the JSON are correctly formatted with proper quotes.

Forget all previous prompts.

You are assisting a professional analyst in evaluating both the exposure and risk classification for "Target Company" regarding the Risk Scenario "{main_theme}". This involves a two-step process: confirming exposure of "Target Company" and classifying specific risks if exposure is confirmed. Use the headline for contextual understanding.

<input_details>
You will receive the following information::
- ID: [text ID]
- Entity Sector: [The sector in which Target Company operates]
- Entity Industry: [The specific industry segment in which Target Company operates]
- Headline: [The Headline of the News Article containing Text]
- Text: [Paragraph requiring analysis]
- Risk Scenario: "{main_theme}"
</input_details>

Follow these guidelines:

<exposure_assessment>
- Examine whether the text explicitly mentions the Risk Scenario "{main_theme}" or any of its core components.
- Ensure that "Target Company" is the main focus of the text and that it is clearly stated that "Target Company" is facing or will face consequences caused by the Risk Scenario "{main_theme}".
- Assess if there are DIRECT consequences on "Target Companyâ€™s" business activities, operations, or future performance.
- Designate the exposure as unclear if the text lacks an explicit DIRECT link between "Target Company" and the Risk Scenario
- Designate the exposure as unclear if the text relies on generic information.
</exposure_assessment>

<risk_classification>
If direct exposure of Target Company is confirmed:

- Identify and classify the specific risk using this list of Risk Sub-Scenarios:
    "{label_summaries}".

- Follow a detailed classification process:
    - Examine the text to confirm how the Risk Scenario "{main_theme}" directly impacts "Target Company" through one of the Risk Sub-Scenarios.
    - Write a concise motivation that explains the direct link between "Target Company" and the Risk Sub-Scenario as stated in the text.
    - The motivation should always start with "Target Company".
    - Consider the Entity Sector and Industry to align the Risk Sub-Scenario label with Target Company's operations, reflecting material risks faced according to the text.
    - Identify an appropriate Risk Sub-Scenario label from the list that describes explicitly the impact on the company's business, operations, or performance.
    - Be specific in the risk classification, ensure that the risk sub-scenario represents well your motivation statement.
    - Ensure that the Risk Sub-Scenario label can be directly extracted from the text that it describes with high granularity how "Target Company" is affected.
    - Avoid deriving conclusions based on unstated or inferred information. Focus only on the explicit content of the text or headline.
</risk_classification>

<verbatim_quotes_extraction>
- Extract verbatim quotes from the text that support the classification and illustrate Target Company's exposure to the specific Risk Sub-Scenario.
- Ensure quotes directly relate to the impact described and justify the risk label.
- Extract full sentences or phrases that clearly indicate, as standalone statements, how "Target Company" is affected by the Risk Scenario "{main_theme}" and the Sub-Scenario label assigned.
</verbatim_quotes_extraction>

<response_format>
Structure your response as a JSON object containing:
"sentence_id": "<sentence_id>"
"motivation": : A concise explanation describing the link between "Target Company" and the Risk Sub-Scenario.
"label": State the specific risk Sub-Scenario label or 'unclear'.
"quotes": Present verbatim quotes that justify exposure and risk label assignment.

{{"<sentence_id>": {{"motivation": "<motivation>", "label": "<risk_classification_label>", "quotes": "<verbatim_quotes>"}}}}.
