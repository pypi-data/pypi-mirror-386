            To cross the street safely, follow these steps:

            1. **Use a Crosswalk**: Always use a designated crosswalk or pedestrian crossing whenever available.
            2. **Press the Button**: If there is a pedestrian signal button, press it and wait for the signal.
            3. **Look Both Ways**: Look left, right, and left again before stepping off the curb.
            4. **Wait for the Signal**: Cross only when the pedestrian signal indicates it is safe to do so or when there is a clear gap in traffic.
            5. **Stay Alert**: Be mindful of turning vehicles and stay attentive while crossing.
            6. **Walk, Don't Run**: Walk across the street; running can increase the risk of falling or not noticing an oncoming vehicle.

            Always follow local traffic rules and be cautious, even when crossing at a crosswalk. Safety is the priority.
