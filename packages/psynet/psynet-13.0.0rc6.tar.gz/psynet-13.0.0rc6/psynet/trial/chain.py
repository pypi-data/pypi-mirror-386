class ChainNetwork(TrialNetwork):
    """
    Implements a network in the form of a chain.
    Intended for use with :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainTrialMaker`.
    Typically the user won't have to override anything here,
    but they can optionally override :meth:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNetwork.validate`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    experiment
        An instantiation of :class:`psynet.experiment.Experiment`,
        corresponding to the current experiment.

    chain_type
        Either ``"within"`` for within-participant chains,
        or ``"across"`` for across-participant chains.

    trials_per_node
        Number of satisfactory trials to be received by the last node
        in the chain before another chain will be added.
        Most paradigms have this equal to 1.

    target_n_nodes
        Indicates the target number of nodes for that network.
        In a network with one trial per node, the total number of nodes will generally
        be one greater than the total number of trials. This is because
        we start with one node, representing the random starting location of the
        chain, and each new trial takes us to a new node.

    participant
        Optional participant with which to associate the network.

    id_within_participant
        If ``participant is not None``, then this provides an optional ID for the network
        that is unique within a given participant.

    sync_group_type : Optional[str]
        The ``sync_group_type`` attribute of the trial maker that owns this network.

    sync_group : Optional[SyncGroup]
        The SyncGroup that owns this network (normally only relevant for within-style chains).


    Attributes
    ----------

    target_n_trials : int or None
        Indicates the target number of trials for that network.
        Left empty by default, but can be set by custom ``__init__`` functions.

    earliest_async_process_start_time : Optional[datetime]
        Time at which the earliest pending async process was called.

    n_alive_nodes : int
        Returns the number of non-failed nodes in the network.

    n_completed_trials : int
        Returns the number of completed and non-failed trials in the network
        (irrespective of asynchronous processes, but excluding repeat trials).

    var : :class:`~psynet.field.VarStore`
        A repository for arbitrary variables; see :class:`~psynet.field.VarStore` for details.

    participant_id : int
        The ID of the associated participant, or ``None`` if there is no such participant.
        Set by default in the ``__init__`` function.

    id_within_participant
        If ``participant is not None``, then this provides an optional ID for the network
        that is unique within a given participant.
        Set by default in the ``__init__`` function.

    chain_type
        Either ``"within"`` for within-participant chains,
        or ``"across"`` for across-participant chains.
        Set by default in the ``__init__`` function.

    trials_per_node
        Number of satisfactory trials to be received by the last node
        in the chain before another chain will be added.
        Most paradigms have this equal to 1.
        Set by default in the ``__init__`` function.

        This definition represents some collection of attributes

        Suppose one wishes to have multiple networks in the experiment,
        each characterised by a different value of an attribute
        (e.g. a different color).
        One approach would be to sample randomly; however, this would not
        guarantee an even distribution of attribute values.
        In this case, a better approach is to use the

                "color": self.balance_across_networks(colors)
            }

        See :meth:`psynet.trial.chain.ChainNetwork.balance_across_networks`
        for details on how this balancing works.

        Returns
        -------

        object
            By default this returns an empty dictionary,
            but this can be customised by subclasses.
            The object should be suitable for serialisation to JSON.
        """
        return {}

    def balance_across_networks(self, values: list):
        """
        Chooses a value from a list, with choices being balanced across networks.
        Relies on the fact that network IDs are guaranteed to be consecutive.
        sequences of integers.

        Suppose we wish to assign our networks to colors,
        and we want to balance color assignment across networks.
        We might write the following:

        ::

            colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
            chosen_color = self.balance_across_networks(colors)

        In across-participant chain designs,
        :meth:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNetwork.balance_across_networks`
        will ensure that the distribution of colors is maximally uniform across
        the experiment by assigning
        the first network to red, the second network to green, the third to blue,
        then the fourth to red, the fifth to green, the sixth to blue,
        and so on. This is achieved by referring to the network's
        :attr:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNetwork.id`
        attribute.
        In within-participant chain designs,
        the same method is used but within participants,
        so that each participant's first network is assigned to red,
        their second network to green,
        their third to blue,
        then their fourth, fifth, and sixth to red, green, and blue respectively.

class ChainNode(TrialNode):
    """
    Represents a node in a chain network.
    In an experimental context, the node represents a state in the experiment;
    in particular, the last node in the chain represents a current state
    in the experiment.

    This class is intended for use with :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainTrialMaker`.
    It subclasses :class:`dallinger.models.Node`.

    The most important attribute is :attr:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode.definition`.
    This is the core information that represents the current state of the node.
    In a transmission chain of drawings, this might be an (encoded) drawing;
    in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People paradigm, this might be the current state
    from the proposal is sampled.

    The user is required to override the following abstract methods:

    * :meth:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode.create_definition_from_seed`,
      which creates a node definition from the seed passed from the previous
      source or node in the chain;

    * :meth:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode.summarize_trials`,
      which summarizes the trials at a given node to produce a seed that can
      be passed to the next node in the chain.

    Parameters
    ----------

    seed
        The seed which is used to initialize the node, potentially stochastically.
        This seed typically comes from either a :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainSource`
        or from another :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode`
        via the :meth:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode.create_seed` method.
        For example, in a transmission chain of drawings, the seed might be
        a serialised version of the last drawn image.

    degree
        The position of the node in the chain,
        where 0 indicates the source,
        where 1 indicates the first node,
        2 the second node, and so on.

    network
        The network with which the node is to be associated.

    experiment
        An instantiation of :class:`psynet.experiment.Experiment`,
        corresponding to the current experiment.

    propagate_failure
        If ``True``, the failure of a trial is propagated to other
        parts of the experiment (the nature of this propagation is left up
        to the implementation).

    participant
        Optional participant with which to associate the node.

    Attributes
    ----------

    degree
        See the ``__init__`` function.

    child_id
        See the ``__init__`` function.

    seed
        See the ``__init__`` function.

    definition
        This is the core information that represents the current state of the node.
        In a transmission chain of drawings, this might be an (encoded) drawing;
        in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People paradigm, this might be the current state
        from the proposal is sampled.
        It is set by the :meth:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode:create_definition_from_seed` method.

    propagate_failure
        See the ``__init__`` function.

    var : :class:`~psynet.field.VarStore`
        A repository for arbitrary variables; see :class:`~psynet.field.VarStore` for details.

    child
        The node's child (i.e. direct descendant) in the chain, or
        ``None`` if no child exists.

    target_n_trials
        The target number of trials for the node,
        set from :attr:`psynet.trial.chain.ChainNetwork.trials_per_node`.

    ready_to_spawn
        Returns ``True`` if the node is ready to spawn a child.
        Not intended for overriding.

    complete_and_processed_trials
        Returns all completed trials associated with the node,
        excluding those that are awaiting some asynchronous processing.
        excludes failed nodes.

    completed_trials
        Returns all completed trials associated with the node.
        Excludes failed nodes and repeat trials.

    n_completed_trials
        Counts the number of completed trials associated with the node.
        Excludes failed nodes and repeat_trials.

    all_trials : list
        A list of all trials owned by that node.

    alive_trials : list
        A list of all non-failed trials owned by that node.

    failed_trials : list
        A list of all failed trials owned by that node.

    viable_trials
        Returns all viable trials associated with the node,
        i.e. all trials that have not failed.

class ChainTrial(Trial):
    """
    Represents a trial in a :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNetwork`.
    The user is expected to override the following methods:

    * :meth:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainTrial.make_definition`,
      responsible for deciding on the content of the trial.
    * :meth:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainTrial.show_trial`,
      determines how the trial is turned into a webpage for presentation to the participant.
    * :meth:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainTrial.show_feedback`.
      defines an optional feedback page to be displayed after the trial.

    The user must also override the ``time_estimate`` class attribute,
    providing the estimated duration of the trial in seconds.
    This is used for predicting the participant's reward
    and for constructing the progress bar.

    The user may also wish to override the
    :meth:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainTrial.async_post_trial` method
    if they wish to implement asynchronous trial processing.

    This class subclasses the `~psynet.trial.main.Trial` class,
    which in turn subclasses the :class:`~dallinger.models.Info` class from Dallinger,
    hence it can be found in the ``Info`` table in the database.
    It inherits these class's methods, which the user is welcome to use
    if they seem relevant.

    Instances can be retrieved using *SQLAlchemy*; for example, the
    following command retrieves the ``ChainTrial`` object with an ID of 1:

    ::

        ChainTrial.query.filter_by(id=1).one()

    Parameters
    ----------

    experiment:
        An instantiation of :class:`psynet.experiment.Experiment`,
        corresponding to the current experiment.

    node:
        An object of class :class:`dallinger.models.Node` to which the
        :class:`~dallinger.models.Trial` object should be attached.
        Complex experiments are often organised around networks of nodes,
        but in the simplest case one could just make one :class:`~dallinger.models.Network`
        for each type of trial and one :class:`~dallinger.models.Node` for each participant,
        and then assign the :class:`~dallinger.models.Trial`
        to this :class:`~dallinger.models.Node`.
        Ask us if you want to use this simple use case - it would be worth adding
        it as a default to this implementation, but we haven't done that yet,
        because most people are using more complex designs.

    participant:
        An instantiation of :class:`psynet.participant.Participant`,
        corresponding to the current participant.

    propagate_failure : bool
        Whether failure of a trial should be propagated to other
        parts of the experiment depending on that trial
        (for example, subsequent parts of a transmission chain).

    run_async_post_trial : bool
        Set this to ``True`` if you want the :meth:`~psynet.trial.main.Trial.async_post_trial`
        method to run after the user responds to the trial.

    Attributes
    ----------

    time_estimate : numeric
        The estimated duration of the trial (including any feedback), in seconds.
        This should generally correspond to the (sum of the) ``time_estimate`` parameters in
        the page(s) generated by ``show_trial``, plus the ``time_estimate`` parameter in
        the page generated by ``show_feedback`` (if defined).
        This is used for predicting the participant's reward
        and for constructing the progress bar.

    node
        The class:`dallinger.models.Node` to which the :class:`~dallinger.models.Trial`
        belongs.

    participant_id : int
        The ID of the associated participant.
        The user should not typically change this directly.
        Stored in ``property1`` in the database.

    complete : bool
        Whether the trial has been completed (i.e. received a response
        from the participant). The user should not typically change this directly.
        Stored in ``property2`` in the database.

    answer : Object
        The response returned by the participant. This is serialised
        to JSON, so it shouldn't be too big.
        The user should not typically change this directly.
        Stored in ``details`` in the database.

    earliest_async_process_start_time : Optional[datetime]
        Time at which the earliest pending async process was called.

    propagate_failure : bool
        Whether failure of a trial should be propagated to other
        parts of the experiment depending on that trial
        (for example, subsequent parts of a transmission chain).

    var : :class:`~psynet.field.VarStore`
        A repository for arbitrary variables; see :class:`~psynet.field.VarStore` for details.

    definition : Object
        An arbitrary Python object that somehow defines the content of
        a trial. Often this will be a dictionary comprising a few
        named parameters.
        The user should not typically change this directly,
        as it is instead determined by
        :meth:`~psynet.trial.main.Trial.make_definition`.

class ChainTrialMaker(NetworkTrialMaker):
    """
    Administers a sequence of trials in a chain-based paradigm.
    This trial maker is suitable for implementing paradigms such as
    Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People, iterated reproduction, and so on.
    It is intended for use with the following helper classes,
    which should be customised for the particular paradigm:

    * :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNetwork`;
      a special type of :class:`~psynet.trial.main.TrialNetwork`

    * :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode`;
      a special type of :class:`~dallinger.models.Node`

    * :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainTrial`;
      a special type of :class:`~psynet.trial.main.NetworkTrial`

    A chain is initialized with a :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainSource` object.
    This :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainSource` object provides
    the initial seed to the chain.
    The :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainSource` object is followed
    by a series of :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode` objects
    which are generated through the course of the experiment.
    The last :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode` in the chain
    represents the current state of the chain, and it determines the
    properties of the next trials to be drawn from that chain.
    A new :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode` object is generated once
    sufficient :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainTrial` objects
    have been created for that :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode`.
    There can be multiple chains in an experiment, with these chains
    either being owned by individual participants ("within-participant" designs)
    or shared across participants ("across-participant" designs).

    Parameters
    ----------

    network_class
        The class object for the networks used by this maker.
        This should subclass :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNetwork`.

    node_class
        The class object for the networks used by this maker.
        This should subclass :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainNode`.

    trial_class
        The class object for trials administered by this maker
        (should subclass :class:`~psynet.trial.chain.ChainTrial`).

    chain_type
        Either ``"within"`` for within-participant chains,
        or ``"across"`` for across-participant chains.

    expected_trials_per_participant
        Expected number of trials that each participant will complete.
        This can either be an integer, or the string ``"n_start_nodes"``,
        which will be read as referring to the number of start nodes with
        which the trial maker is initialized
        (i.e. ``len(start_nodes)``, ``chains_per_experiment``,
        or ``chains_per_participant`` as appropriate).
        This is used for timeline/progress estimation purposes.

    max_trials_per_participant
        Maximum number of trials that each participant may complete (optional);
        once this number is reached, the participant will move on
        to the next stage in the timeline.
        This can either be an integer, or the string ``"n_start_nodes"``,
        which will be read as referring to the number of start nodes with
        which the trial maker is initialized
        (i.e. ``len(start_nodes)``, ``chains_per_experiment``,
        or ``chains_per_participant`` as appropriate).

    chains_per_participant
        Number of chains to be created for each participant;
        only relevant if ``chain_type="within"``.

    chains_per_experiment
        Number of chains to be created for the entire experiment;
        only relevant if ``chain_type="across"``.

    max_nodes_per_chain
        Specifies chain length in terms of the
        number of data-collection iterations that are required to complete a chain.
        The number of successful participant trials required to complete the chain then
        corresponds to ``trials_per_node * max_nodes_per_chain``.

    max_nodes_per_chain
        Maximum number of nodes in the chain before the chain is marked as full and no more nodes will be added.

    trials_per_node
        Number of satisfactory trials to be received by the last node
        in the chain before another chain will be added.
        Most paradigms have this equal to 1.

    balance_across_chains
        Whether trial selection should be actively balanced across chains,
        such that trials are preferentially sourced from chains with
        fewer valid trials.

    start_nodes
        A list of nodes that are used to initialize the chains.
        In an across-participant trial maker, this should be a simple list of instances of the class ``node_class``.
        In a within-participant trial maker, a fresh set of nodes should be created for each new participant.
        To achieve this, ``start_nodes`` should be a lambda function that returns a list of newly created nodes.
        This lambda function may accept ``participant`` as one of its arguments.

    # balance_strategy
        #   A two-element list that determines how balancing occurs, if ``balance_across_chains`` is ``True``.
        #   If the list contains "across", then the balancing will take into account trials from other participants.
        #   If it contains "within", then the balancing will take into account trials from the present participant.
        #   If both are selected, then the balancing strategy will prioritize balancing within the current participant,
        #   but will use counts from other participants as a tie breaker.

    check_performance_at_end
        If ``True``, the participant's performance
        is evaluated at the end of the series of trials.

    check_performance_every_trial
        If ``True``, the participant's performance
        is evaluated after each trial.

    recruit_mode
        Selects a recruitment criterion for determining whether to recruit
        another participant. The built-in criteria are ``"n_participants"``
        and ``"n_trials"``, though the latter requires overriding of
        :attr:`~psynet.trial.main.TrialMaker.n_trials_still_required`.

    target_n_participants
        Target number of participants to recruit for the experiment. All
        participants must successfully finish the experiment to count
        towards this quota. This target is only relevant if
        ``recruit_mode="n_participants"``.

    fail_trials_on_premature_exit
        If ``True``, a participant's trials are marked as failed
        if they leave the experiment prematurely.
        Defaults to ``False`` because failing such trials can end up destroying
        large parts of existing chains.

    fail_trials_on_participant_performance_check
        If ``True``, a participant's trials are marked as failed
        if the participant fails a performance check.
        Defaults to ``False`` because failing such trials can end up destroying
        large parts of existing chains.

    propagate_failure
        If ``True``, the failure of a trial is propagated to other
        parts of the experiment (the nature of this propagation is left up
        to the implementation).

    n_repeat_trials
        Number of repeat trials to present to the participant. These trials
        are typically used to estimate the reliability of the participant's
        responses.
        Defaults to ``0``.

    wait_for_networks
        If ``True``, then the participant will be made to wait if there are
        still more networks to participate in, but these networks are pending asynchronous processes.

    allow_revisiting_networks_in_across_chains : bool
        If this is set to ``True``, then participants can revisit the same network
        in across-participant chains. The default is ``False``.

    choose_participant_group
        Only relevant if the trial maker uses nodes with non-default participant groups.
        In this case the experimenter is expected to supply a function that takes participant as an argument
        and returns the chosen participant group for that trial maker.
        For example, to randomly assign participants to one of two groups called g1 and g2, one could write::

            choose_participant_group=lambda(participant): random.choice(["g1", "g2"])

        Similarly, to alternate participants between two groups, one could write::

            choose_participant_group=lambda(participant): ["g1", "g2"][participant.id % 2]

    sync_group_type
        Optional SyncGroup type to use for synchronizing participant allocation to nodes.
        When this is set, then the ordinary node allocation logic will only apply to the 'leader'
        of each SyncGroup. The other members of this SyncGroup will follow that leader around,
        so that in every given trial the SyncGroup works on the same node together.

    sync_group_max_wait_time
        The maximum time that the participant will be allowed to wait for the SyncGroup to be ready.
        If this time is exceeded then the participant will be failed and the experiment will
        terminate early. Defaults to 45.0 seconds.


    Attributes
    ----------

    check_timeout_interval_sec : float
        How often to check for trials that have timed out, in seconds (default = 30).
        Users are invited to override this.

    response_timeout_sec : float
        How long until a trial's response times out, in seconds (default = 60)
        (i.e. how long PsyNet will wait for the participant's response to a trial).
        This is a lower bound on the actual timeout
        time, which depends on when the timeout daemon next runs,
        which in turn depends on :attr:`~psynet.trial.main.TrialMaker.check_timeout_interval_sec`.
        Users are invited to override this.

    async_timeout_sec : float
        How long until an async process times out, in seconds (default = 300).
        This is a lower bound on the actual timeout
        time, which depends on when the timeout daemon next runs,
        which in turn depends on :attr:`~psynet.trial.main.TrialMaker.check_timeout_interval_sec`.
        Users are invited to override this.

    network_query : sqlalchemy.orm.Query
        An SQLAlchemy query for retrieving all networks owned by the current trial maker.
        Can be used for operations such as the following: ``self.network_query.count()``.

    n_networks : int
        Returns the number of networks owned by the trial maker.

    networks : list
        Returns the networks owned by the trial maker.

    performance_threshold : float
        Score threshold used by the default performance check method, defaults to 0.0.
        By default, corresponds to the minimum proportion of non-failed trials that
        the participant must achieve to pass the performance check.

    end_performance_check_waits : bool
        If ``True`` (default), then the final performance check waits until all trials no
        longer have any pending asynchronous processes.
