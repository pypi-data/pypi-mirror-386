    A chord is a collection of notes to be played to the user.
    Chords can be played using the :class:`~psynet.js_synth.JSSynth` control.

    Parameters
    ----------

    pitches:
        A list of pitches to be played, with each pitch expressed as a number on the MIDI scale,
        where 60 corresponds to middle C (C4) and integer values correspond to semitones.

    duration:
        The duration of the chord, in seconds.
        If left to its default value (`"default"`), then the chord's duration will instead be inherited
        from the ``default_duration`` argument provided to :class:`~psynet.js_synth.JSSynth`.

    silence:
        The length of silence to have after the chord, in seconds.
        If left to its default value (`"default"`), then the chord's duration will instead be inherited
        from the ``default_silence`` argument provided to :class:`~psynet.js_synth.JSSynth`.

    timbre:
        The timbre with which to play the chord, specified as a string.
        There are three different configurations that one can use:

        - Leave both ``timbre`` arguments at their default values of ``"default"``. In this case the chord
          will be played with a standard harmonic complex tone.

        - Set the ``timbre`` argument in :class:`~psynet.js_synth.JSSynth` to a customized timbre,
          for example ``InstrumentTimbre("piano")``, while leaving the timbre argument in :class:`~psynet.js_synth.Chord`
          to its default value. In this case the chord will be played with the customized timbre.

        - Set the ``timbre`` argument in :class:`~psynet.js_synth.JSSynth` to a dictionary of customized timbres,
          and select from this dictionary by specifying an appropriate key in the ``timbre`` argument
          of the :class:`~psynet.js_synth.Chord` object. This provides a way to move between multiple timbres
          in the same sequence.

        Applying the same logic, one may also pass a list of strings, where each element provides the timbre
        for a different note in the chord.

    pan:
        Optional panning parameter, taking values between -1 (full-left) and +1 (full-right).
        If this is provided as a list of numbers then these numbers are applied to the respective
        notes as specified in ``pitches``.

    volume:
        Optional volume parameter, taking values between 0 and 1. Passed directly to JSSynth.

    This uses a Javascript library ('js-synthesizer')written by Raja Marjieh,

    The API for this synthesizer should be considered experimental and potentially subject to change.

    The synthesizer allows for playing sequences of arbitrary notes or chords.
    Only a limited form of polyphony is supported: specifically, the synthesizer can play chords,
    but all the notes in an individual chord must start and end at the same time.

    Note: due to a limitation of the underlying library, performance will suffer drastically
    if you try and combine Shepard tones with harmonic tones in the same sequence.


    Parameters
    ----------

    text:
        Text to display to the participant. This can either be a string
        for plain text, or an HTML specification from ``markupsafe.Markup``.

    sequence:
        Sequence to play to the participant. This should be a list of objects
        of class :class:`~psynet.js_synth.Chord` or of class :class:`~psynet.js_synth.Note`.

    timbre:
        Optional dictionary of timbres to draw from. The keys of this dictionary should link
        to the timbre arguments of the :class:`~psynet.js_synth.Chord`/:class:`~psynet.js_synth.Note` objects
        in ``sequence``. The values should be objects of class :class:`~psynet.js_synth.Timbre`.
        The default is a harmonic complex tone.

    default_duration:
        Default duration of each chord/note in seconds. This may be overridden by
        specifying the ``duration`` argument in the :class:`~psynet.js_synth.Chord`/:class:`~psynet.js_synth.Note` objects.

    default_silence:
        Default silence after each chord/note in seconds. This may be overridden by
        specifying the ``silence`` argument in the :class:`~psynet.js_synth.Chord`/:class:`~psynet.js_synth.Note` objects.

    text_align:
        CSS alignment of the text (default = ``"left"``).

    controls:
        Whether to give the user playback controls, and which controls (default = ``False``).
        Accepts either a boolean or an iterable (dictionary, set, list).
        False results in no controls being displayed.
        True results in all controls being displayed (Play, Stop, Loop).
        An iterable can be used to select specific controls to display. A list, set, or dictionary with
        empty values will use standard labels. Custom labels can be specified as the dictionary values.
        A boolean, set, or list will result in automatically translated button labels if using translation.
        A dictionary will not be automatically translated - use this to specify custom values for button labels.
