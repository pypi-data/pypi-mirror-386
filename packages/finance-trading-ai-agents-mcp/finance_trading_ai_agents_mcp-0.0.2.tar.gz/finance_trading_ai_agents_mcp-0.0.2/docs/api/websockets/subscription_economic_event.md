## Why Subscribe to Economic Events

- **Market-Moving Data**: Economic indicators often cause significant market movements
- **Trading Opportunities**: Identify potential trading opportunities based on economic releases
- **Risk Management**: Prepare for market volatility around key economic announcements
- **Advance Notifications**: Receive alerts before important economic data releases
- **Cross-Market Analysis**: Understand how economic data affects various asset classes

## Economic Event Subscription

### Basic Subscription

To subscribe to specific economic events, send the following message:

  "status": "ok",
  "code": 200,
  "message": "success",
  "reference": null,
  "result": {
    "event": [
      "US:INFLATION_CPI_NSA:REAL_TIME",
      "US:UNEMPLOYMENT_RATE:REAL_TIME"

      }
    
    ]
}
```


## Python Implementation Example

The following example demonstrates how to subscribe to economic events using the AiTrados Python client library:

```python
import os
import signal
from aitrados_api.common_lib.common import logger
from aitrados_api import SubscribeEndpoint
from aitrados_api import WebSocketClient


def handle_msg(client: WebSocketClient, message):
    # Generic message handler
    pass


def event_handle_msg(client: WebSocketClient, data_list):
    # Handler for economic event messages
    for record in data_list:
        symbol = f"{record.get('country_iso_code')}:{record.get('event_code')}:{record.get('preview_interval')}"
        string = f"event:{symbol} --> {record.get('event_timestamp')}"
        logger.info(string)


def show_subscribe_handle_msg(client: WebSocketClient, message):
    # Handler for subscription status messages
    logger.info(f"âœ… Subscription status: {message}")
    print("subscriptions", client.all_subscribed_topics)


def auth_handle_msg(client: WebSocketClient, message):
    # Handler for authentication messages
    if not client.authorized:
        return

    # Subscribe to economic events after successful authentication
    client.subscribe_event("US:INFLATION_CPI_NSA:REAL_TIME", "US:UNEMPLOYMENT_RATE:REAL_TIME")


# Initialize WebSocket client
client = WebSocketClient(
    secret_key=os.getenv("AITRADOS_SECRET_KEY", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"),
    is_reconnect=True,
    handle_msg=handle_msg,
    event_handle_msg=event_handle_msg,  # Specific handler for economic events
    show_subscribe_handle_msg=show_subscribe_handle_msg,
    auth_handle_msg=auth_handle_msg,
    endpoint=SubscribeEndpoint.DELAYED,  # Use DELAYED or REALTIME
    debug=False
)


def signal_handler(sig, frame):
    client.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
    client.run(is_thread=False)
    # If running in a thread, you might need a loop:
    # while True:
    #     sleep(2)
```

## Subscription Strategies

### High-Impact Events Only

To focus on market-moving events and reduce noise:

```python
# Subscribe only to high-impact economic indicators
client.subscribe_event(
    "US:NONFARM_PAYROLLS:REAL_TIME",
    "US:INFLATION_CPI_NSA:REAL_TIME",
    "US:INTEREST_RATE:REAL_TIME",
    "US:GDP_QOQ:REAL_TIME"
)
```

### Multi-Region Monitoring

To monitor key indicators across multiple regions:

```python
# Monitor inflation across major economies
client.subscribe_event(
    "US:INFLATION_CPI_NSA:REAL_TIME",
    "EU:INFLATION_CPI_YOY:REAL_TIME",
    "UK:INFLATION_CPI_YOY:REAL_TIME",
    "JP:INFLATION_CPI_YOY:REAL_TIME"
)
```

### Advance Notifications

To receive advance notifications before important releases:

```python
# Get notifications at different intervals before NFP release
client.subscribe_event(
    "US:NONFARM_PAYROLLS:1DAY",  # 1 day before
    "US:NONFARM_PAYROLLS:60M",   # 60 minutes before
    "US:NONFARM_PAYROLLS:15M",   # 15 minutes before
    "US:NONFARM_PAYROLLS:REAL_TIME"  # Actual release
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Strategic Subscriptions**: Focus on economic events relevant to your trading strategy and asset classes.

2. **Advance Planning**: Use preview intervals to prepare for market volatility around major economic releases.

3. **Complete Coverage**: For critical indicators, consider subscribing to both advance notifications and real-time data.

4. **Data Integration**: Correlate economic data with price movements for comprehensive market analysis.

5. **Automated Responses**: Develop predefined responses to different economic scenarios based on deviation from forecasts.

6. **Economic Calendar**: Use economic event subscriptions to build a real-time economic calendar for your organization.
