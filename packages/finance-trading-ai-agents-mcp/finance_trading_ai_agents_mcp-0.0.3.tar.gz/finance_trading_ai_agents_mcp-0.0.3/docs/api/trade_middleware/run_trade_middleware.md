# Running the AiTrados Trading Middleware

This document shows a minimal, production-minded way to start the AiTrados trading communication middleware, demonstrates expected output, and describes instance reuse and multi-process best practices.

## Overview

The middleware integrates API calls, WebSocket subscription management (subscribe/unsubscribe), chart streaming (scrolling OHLC data), and multi-symbol multi-timeframe alignment. It exposes a single entrypoint to start all routers and managers, while keeping class instances reusable across modules, processes and languages via ZeroMQ.

## Quick start

Use the provided helper to start the entire middleware stack. The example below demonstrates a safe pattern that keeps the process alive until a KeyboardInterrupt is received.

```python
import time
from aitrados_api.universal_interface.trade_middleware_instance import AitradosTradeMiddlewareInstance

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start all middleware components (RPC router, Pub/Sub router, managers, clients, etc.)
    AitradosTradeMiddlewareInstance.run_all()

    try:
        # Keep the main thread alive while background routers run
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("closing...")
```

Notes:
- run_all() initializes RPC & Pub/Sub routers, API and WS clients, chart managers, and multi-timeframe aligners.
- Keep the process alive so background threads/processes can continue to operate.

## Expected output (example logs)

```shell
2025-10-22 21:12:07.686 | INFO     | üì° Pubsub Router Started
2025-10-22 21:12:07.686 | DEBUG    |                          Sub addr:['tcp://127.0.0.1:51593', 'ipc:///tmp/aitrados_sub_your_pc_name.sock', 'inproc://aitrados_sub']
2025-10-22 21:12:07.686 | DEBUG    |                          Pub addr:['tcp://127.0.0.1:51594', 'ipc:///tmp/aitrados_pub_sub_your_pc_name.sock', 'inproc://aitrados_pub']

2025-10-22 21:12:07.686 | DEBUG    |                          RPC backend addr:['tcp://127.0.0.1:51592', 'ipc:///tmp/aitrados_backend_sub_your_pc_name.sock', 'inproc://aitrados_backend']
2025-10-22 21:12:07.888 | DEBUG    | RPC backend 'aitrados_api' is submitting to Register RPC Service
```

## Instance reuse (class reuse)

- api_client, ws_client, chart streaming managers, and multi-timeframe aligners are intended to be initialized once per middleware instance.
- Other modules (in the same process or connected via ZeroMQ) should reuse these instances through the exposed RPC/IPC interfaces.
- Even across processes and languages the same logical instances are accessible via the middleware‚Äôs messaging layer.

## GIL, heavy strategies and multi-process guidance

- Python's GIL can limit CPU-bound strategy performance if everything runs in a single process.
- Recommendations:
  1. Decompose heavy strategies into separate processes or services (or run them in Rust/C++ if low-latency is required).
  2. Run long-running or CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., advanced price-action analysis, local LLM inference) outside the main middleware process.
  3. Use ZeroMQ-backed RPC/pub-sub to exchange data and commands between the middleware and worker processes.

## Common strategy bundles

Typical components combined in AiTrados deployments:
- OHLC Data Processing
- Macroeconomic Analysis
- Fundamental Analysis
- Traditional Technical Indicators
- Advanced Price Action Strategies
- News & Event Processing
- Breaking News Analysis
- Financial Calendar Events
- Risk Management
- Financial MCP Tools
- LLM-Powered Strategies

Design each component as a separate, replaceable module and use the middleware to orchestrate data flows and decisions.

## Troubleshooting & operational notes

- IPC sockets under /tmp may require correct permission and cleanup between runs.
- Ensure configured TCP ports are open and not blocked by local firewall rules.
- For debugging, enable DEBUG logging to inspect router addresses and registration flow.
- When upgrading or restarting, gracefully stop components to avoid stale IPC files.
