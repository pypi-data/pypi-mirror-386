	abstract = {Heatwaves impose disastrous impacts over human, natural and industrial systems across the globe. Over a relatively short period of time, there has been considerable advancement in the scientific understanding of heatwaves. Such advancements include how heatwaves are measured, their driving mechanisms, observed and projected changes, and quantifying the anthropogenic influence behind these changes. This paper reviews these developments. There are however gaps in the scientific literature that should be filled in order to gain a more complete understanding of the changing nature of heatwaves. The conclusions of this paper propose that the global community should work toward a unified framework in which to measure heatwaves, reduce spatial and temporal gaps by increasing the global observation network, further research on how physical mechanisms interact for heatwave manifestation, and continual work and expansion of methods used for attribution studies on observed heatwaves and their trends.},

	abstract = {Despite their adverse impacts, definitions and measurements of heat waves are ambiguous and inconsistent, generally being endemic to only the group affected, or the respective study reporting the analysis. The present study addresses this issue by employing a set of three heat wave definitions, derived from surveying heat-related indices in the climate science literature. The definitions include three or more consecutive days above one of the following: the 90th percentile for maximum temperature, the 90th percentile for minimum temperature, and positive extreme heat factor (EHF) conditions. Additionally, each index is studied using a multiaspect framework measuring heat wave number, duration, participating days, and the peak and mean magnitudes. Observed climatologies and trends computed by Sen's Kendall slope estimator are presented for the Australian continent for two time periods (1951–2008 and 1971–2008). Trends in all aspects and definitions are smaller in magnitude but more significant for 1951–2008 than for 1971–2008. Considerable similarities exist in trends of the yearly number of days participating in a heat wave and yearly heat wave frequency, suggesting that the number of available heat wave days drives the number of events. Larger trends in the hottest part of a heat wave suggest that heat wave intensity is increasing faster than the mean magnitude. Although the direct results of this study cannot be inferred for other regions, the methodology has been designed as such that it is widely applicable. Furthermore, it includes a range of definitions that may be useful for a wide range of systems impacted by heat waves.},

	abstract = {We investigate heat waves defined as periods of at least 3 consecutive days of extremely high daily maximum temperature affecting at least 30 \% of western Europe. This definition has been chosen to select heat waves that might impact western European electricity supply. Even though not all such heat waves threaten it, the definition allows to identify a sufficient number of events, the strongest being potentially harmful. The heat waves are characterised by their duration, spatial extent, intensity and severity. The heat wave characteristics are calculated for historical and future climate based on results of climate model simulations conducted during the 5th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The uncertainty of future anthropogenic forcing is taken into account by analysing results for the Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The historical simulations are evaluated against the EOBS gridded station data. The CMIP5 ensemble median captures well the observed mean heat wave characteristics. However, no model simulates a heat wave as severe as observed during August 2003. Under future climate conditions, the heat waves become more frequent and have higher mean duration, extent and intensity. The ensemble spread is larger than the scenario uncertainty. The shift of the temperature distribution is more important for the increase of the cumulative heat wave severity than the broadening of the temperature distribution. However, the broadening leads to an amplification of the cumulative heat wave severity by a factor of 1.7 for RCP4.5 and 1.5 for RCP8.5.},

	abstract = {Heat wave (HW) events are becoming more frequent, and they have important consequences because of the negative effects they can have not only on the human population in health terms, but also on biodiversity and agriculture. This motivated a study of the trends in HW events over Extremadura, a region in the southwest of Spain, with much of its area in summer devoted to the production of irrigated crops such as maize and tomatoes. Heat waves were defined for the study as two consecutive days with temperatures above the 95th percentile of the summer (June-August) maximum temperature (Tmax) time series. Two datasets were used: one consisted of 13 daily temperature records uniformly distributed over the Region, and the other was the SPAIN02 gridded observational dataset, extracting just the points corresponding to Extremadura. The trends studied were in the duration, intensity, and frequency of HW events, and in other parameters such as the mean, low (25th percentile), and high (75th percentile) values. In general terms, the results showed significant positive trends in those parameters over the east, the northwest, and a small area in the south of the Region. In order to study changes in HW characteristics (duration, frequency and intensity) considering different subperiods, a stochastic model was used to generate 1000 time series equivalent to the observed ones. The results showed that there were no significant changes in HW duration in the last 10-year subperiod in comparison with the first. But the results were different for warm events (WE), defined with a lower threshold (the 75th percentile), which are also important for agriculture. For several sites, there were significant changes in WE duration, frequency, and intensity.},

	abstract = {The temporal structure of heat waves having substantial human impact varies widely, with many featuring a compound structure of hot days interspersed with cooler breaks. In contrast, many heat wave definitions employed by meteorologists include a continuous threshold-exceedance duration criterion. This study examines the hazard of these diverse sequences of extreme heat in the present, and their change with global warming. We define compound heat waves to include those periods with additional hot days following short breaks in heat wave duration. We apply these definitions to analyze daily temperature data from observations, NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory global climate model simulations of the past and projected climate, and synthetically generated time series. We demonstrate that compound heat waves will constitute a greater proportion of heat wave hazard as the climate warms and suggest an explanation for this phenomenon. This result implies that in order to limit heat-related mortality and morbidity with global warming, there is a need to consider added vulnerability caused by the compounding of heat waves.},

	abstract = {Increased temperature will result in longer, more frequent, and more intense heat waves. Changes in temperature variability have been deemed necessary to account for future heat wave characteristics. However, this has been quantified only in Europe and North America, while the rest of the globe remains unexplored. Using late century global climate projections, we show that annual mean temperature increases is the key factor defining heat wave changes in most regions. We find that commonly studied areas are an exception rather than the standard and the mean climate change signal generally outweighs any influence from variability changes. More importantly, differences in warming across seasons are responsible for most of the heat wave changes and their consideration relegates the contribution of variability to a marginal role. This reveals that accurately capturing mean seasonal changes is crucial to estimate future heat waves and reframes our interpretation of future temperature extremes.},
