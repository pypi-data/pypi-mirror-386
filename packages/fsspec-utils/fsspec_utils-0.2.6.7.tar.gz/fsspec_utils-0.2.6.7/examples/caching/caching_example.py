"""
Example: Using Caching with fsspec-utils

This example demonstrates how to use the caching functionality in fsspec-utils 
to improve performance for repeated file operations.

The example shows:
1. Creating a filesystem with caching enabled
2. Performing file operations that populate the cache
3. Demonstrating improved performance on subsequent reads
4. Showing how cached files can be accessed even when the original source is unavailable
