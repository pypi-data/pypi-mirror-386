## Highlights

- Auto-discover MCP configurations
- Detects MCP Security Vulnerabilities:
  - Prompt Injection Attacks
  - Tool Poisoning Attacks
  - Toxic Flows
- Scan local STDIO MCP Servers
- Scan remote HTTP/SSE MCP Servers

## Quick Start

### MCP Server Scanning

To run an MCP scan:

```bash
uvx mcp-scan@latest
```

This will scan your installed servers for security vulnerabilities in tools, prompts, and resources. It will automatically discover a variety of MCP configurations, including Claude, Cursor and Windsurf.

To scan a particular MCP server configuration, for example, a VS Code MCP config, you can run:

```bash
mcp-scan ~/.vscode/mcp.json
```

## MCP Security Scanner Capabilities

MCP-Scan is a security scanning tool to both statically and dynamically scan and monitor your MCP connections. It checks them for common security vulnerabilities like [prompt injections](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks), [tool poisoning](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks) and [toxic flows](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-github-vulnerability). Consult our detailed [Documentation](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/docs/mcp-scan) for more information.

MCp-Scan operates in two main modes which can be used jointly or separately:

1. `mcp-scan scan` statically scans all your installed servers for malicious tool descriptions and tools (e.g. [tool poisoning attacks](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks), cross-origin escalation, rug pull attacks, toxic flows).

    [Quickstart →](#server-scanning).

2. `mcp-scan proxy` continuously monitors your MCP connections in real-time, and can restrict what agent systems can do over MCP (tool call checking, data flow constraints, PII detection, indirect prompt injection etc.).

    [Quickstart →](#server-proxying).

## Features

- Scanning of Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and other file-based MCP client configurations
- Scanning for prompt injection attacks in tools and [tool poisoning attacks](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks) using [Guardrails](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/invariant?tab=readme-ov-file#analyzer)
- [Enforce guardrailing policies](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/docs/mcp-scan/guardrails) on MCP tool calls and responses, including PII detection, secrets detection, tool restrictions and entirely custom guardrailing policies.
- Audit and log MCP traffic in real-time via [`mcp-scan proxy`](#proxy)
- Detect cross-origin escalation attacks (e.g. [tool shadowing](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks)), and detect and prevent [MCP rug pull attacks](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks), i.e. mcp-scan detects changes to MCP tools via hashing



### Server Proxying

Using `mcp-scan proxy`, you can monitor, log, and safeguard all MCP traffic on your machine. This allows you to inspect the runtime behavior of agents and tools, and prevent attacks from e.g., untrusted sources (like websites or emails) that may try to exploit your agents. mcp-scan proxy is a dynamic security layer that runs in the background, and continuously monitors your MCP traffic.

#### Example Run

#### Enforcing Guardrails

You can also add guardrailing rules, to restrict and validate the sequence of tool uses passing through proxy.

For this, create a `~/.mcp-scan/guardrails_config.yml` with the following contents:

```yml
<client-name>:  # your client's shorthand (e.g., cursor, claude, windsurf)
  <server-name>:  # your server's name according to the mcp config (e.g., whatsapp-mcp)
    guardrails:
      secrets: block # block calls/results with secrets

      custom_guardrails:
        - name: "Filter tool results with 'error'"
          id: "error_filter_guardrail"
          action: block # or just 'log'
          content: |
            raise "An error was found." if:
              (msg: ToolOutput)
              "error" in msg.content
```
From then on, all calls proxied via `mcp-scan proxy` will be checked against your configured guardrailing rules for the current client/server.

Custom guardrails are implemented using Invariant Guardrails. To learn more about these rules, [see this playground environment](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/docs/guardrails/) and the [official documentation](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/docs/).

## How It Works

### Scanning

MCP-Scan `scan` searches through your configuration files to find MCP server configurations. It connects to these servers and retrieves tool descriptions.

It then scans tool descriptions, both with local checks and by invoking Invariant Guardrailing via an API. For this, tool names and descriptions are shared with invariantlabs.ai. By using MCP-Scan, you agree to the invariantlabs.ai [terms of use](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/terms) and [privacy policy](https://invariantlabs.ai/privacy-policy).

Invariant Labs is collecting data for security research purposes (only about tool descriptions and how they change over time, not your user data). Don't use MCP-scan if you don't want to share your tools. Additionally, a unique, persistent, and anonymous ID is assigned to your scans for analysis. You can opt out of sending this information using the `--opt-out` flag.

MCP-scan does not store or log any usage data, i.e. the contents and results of your MCP tool calls.

### Proxying

For runtime monitoring using `mcp-scan proxy`, MCP-Scan can be used as a proxy server. This allows you to monitor and guardrail system-wide MCP traffic in real-time. To do this, mcp-scan temporarily injects a local [Invariant Gateway](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/invariant-gateway) into MCP server configurations, which intercepts and analyzes traffic. After the `proxy` command exits, Gateway is removed from the configurations.

You can also configure guardrailing rules for the proxy to enforce security policies on the fly. This includes PII detection, secrets detection, tool restrictions, and custom guardrailing policies. Guardrails and proxying operate entirely locally using [Guardrails](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/invariant) and do not require any external API calls.
