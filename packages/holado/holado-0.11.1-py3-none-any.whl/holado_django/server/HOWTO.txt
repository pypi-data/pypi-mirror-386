HOWTO create a REST server easier with HolAdo:

    1. Create a working directory (WORK_DIR) where all server files will be stored
    2. Copy in WORK_DIR the appropriate django project. For this case, it is holado_django/server/django_projects/rest_api
    3. Update application with wanted REST APIs. For this case, update/add files in rest_api/rest_api/application: views.py, models.py,...
    4. Make migrations if needed (cf django documentation)
    5. Run server manually with a command like "python manage.py runserver", or use module holado_django/server/django_server.py

    Example: A simple example is in holado_examples/projects/server_rest/server_rest_example

    Note: These steps are simple and doesn't give help to developpers knowing Django and Django REST framework.
          They should be a first step towards future more powerful tools.
