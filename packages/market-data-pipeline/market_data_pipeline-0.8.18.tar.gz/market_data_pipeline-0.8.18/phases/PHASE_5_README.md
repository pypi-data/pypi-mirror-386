## 🎯 Bottom Line

### Viability Score: **8.5/10** ✅

**Recommendation**: **PROCEED WITH MODIFICATIONS**

The Phase 5.0 proposal is **architecturally sound** and **feasible**, but requires **2 critical decisions** before implementation can begin.

---

## ⚠️ BLOCKERS - Decisions Required

### 🔴 DECISION 1: Runtime API Strategy (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Two runtime APIs will exist:
- Existing: `orchestration.PipelineRuntime` (Phase 3.0)
- Proposed: `dag.DagRuntime` + `orchestration.DAGRuntimeAPI` (Phase 5.0)

**Your Options**:

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|------|------|----------------|
| **A** | Merge into one API | Clean, no confusion | More work upfront | ⭐ **RECOMMENDED** |
| **B** | Keep separate | Faster start | User confusion | ❌ Not recommended |
| **C** | Deprecate old | Clean break | Breaks compatibility | ❌ Against goals |

**My Recommendation**: **Option A - Merge**
```python
# Enhanced orchestration.PipelineRuntime
runtime = PipelineRuntime()
await runtime.run_pipeline(...)  # Existing (Phase 3.0)
await runtime.run_dag(...)       # New (Phase 5.0)
```

**Action Required**: Choose an option before starting implementation.

---

### 🟡 DECISION 2: External Dependencies (IMPORTANT)

**Problem**: Examples require packages that may not exist:
```python
from market_data_core import MarketDataProvider        # Not in repo
from market_data_store.coordinator import WriteCoordinator  # v0.9.0 unreleased
from market_data_ibkr import IBKRProvider             # Not in repo
```

**Your Options**:

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A** | Stub everything | Works now | Less real testing |
| **B** | Wait for deps | Full integration | Delays Phase 5.0 |
| **C** | Hybrid approach | Best of both | More complex |

**My Recommendation**: **Option C - Hybrid (Conditional Imports)**
```python
try:
    from market_data_core import MarketDataProvider
    HAS_CORE = True
except ImportError:
    HAS_CORE = False
    # Use stub or skip tests
```

**Action Required**: Confirm this approach is acceptable.

- ✅ Current version: v0.8.0 (Phase 3.0 complete)
- ✅ Test baseline: **123 tests passing**
- ✅ Git status: Clean working tree
- ✅ Branch: `base` (up to date with `origin/base`)

### Scaffolding Analyzed
- ✅ All provided code reviewed
- ✅ Type hints checked (minor fixes needed)
- ✅ Prometheus metrics verified
- ✅ Async patterns validated
- ✅ Protocol compatibility confirmed

### Dependencies Identified
**Required additions**:
```toml
[project.dependencies]
"mmh3>=4.0.0",  # Hash partitioning
# Note: Using stdlib logging (not loguru)
```

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Opt-in design maintains all existing APIs

## 📊 Implementation Estimate

```
Total Effort:  66-88 hours
Timeline:      3-4 weeks (2 hrs/day) or 1.5-2 weeks (full-time)
New Tests:     +51-68 tests
New Files:     ~30 files across 4 packages
Risk Level:    MEDIUM (manageable)
Confidence:    85%
```

### Phase Breakdown:
1. **Phase 5.0.1** - Foundation (15-20h) - Core DAG runtime
2. **Phase 5.0.2** - Windowing (10-15h) - Stateful operators
3. **Phase 5.0.3** - Operators (8-10h) - Contrib operators
4. **Phase 5.0.4** - Adapters (12-15h) - External integration
5. **Phase 5.0.5** - API (8-10h) - Unified interface
6. **Phase 5.0.6** - Examples (5-8h) - Documentation
7. **Phase 5.0.7** - Backpressure (8-10h) - Store integration

4. ✅ Builds on Phase 3.0 foundation
5. ✅ Clear business value (DAG flexibility)
6. ✅ Production-ready features (metrics, backpressure)

### Issues Identified
1. ⚠️ Runtime API overlap (needs decision)
2. ⚠️ External dependencies unavailable (needs strategy)
3. ⚠️ Incomplete implementations (expected, accounted for)
4. ⚠️ Type hints need minor fixes (list → List for 3.11)
