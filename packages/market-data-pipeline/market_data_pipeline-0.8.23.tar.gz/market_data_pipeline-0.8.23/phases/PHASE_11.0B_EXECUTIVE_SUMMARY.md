# Phase 11.0B — Schema Registry Integration: Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Repo**: `market_data_pipeline` (v1.0.0)  
**Assessment**: ⚠️ **VIABLE BUT DEFER**

---

## 🎯 Quick Decision

**Recommendation**: **DEFER Phase 11.0B for 2-3 weeks**

**Why?**
- ✅ Technically viable and well-designed
- ❌ Registry Service not deployed yet
- ❌ Client SDK not published
- ⏰ Too soon after v1.0.0 release
- 🔄 Store should integrate first (publishes schemas)

**When to Start?**
- Registry Service deployed (production URL available)
- `core-registry-client` published to PyPI
- Pipeline v1.0.0 validated in production (1-2 weeks)
- Store completes their Phase 11.0B integration

---

## 📊 Current State

### ✅ Strengths
- Just shipped v1.0.0 with Pulse integration (207 tests passing)
- Strong contract test foundation (`tests/contracts/`)
- Clean DTO-based architecture from Phase 8.0
- CI workflows ready for enhancement
- Caching patterns from Pulse (reusable)

### ⚠️ Gaps
- Registry Service: Test artifacts only, no live deployment
- Client SDK: Code exists but not on PyPI
- Fresh release: Need production stabilization period
- Dependency order: Store publishes schemas → should go first

---

## 💡 What Phase 11.0B Adds

### CI/CD Benefits
```bash
# Instead of bundled schemas from Core repo
git clone core && cp schemas/ → tests/

# Use Registry as source of truth
curl https://registry.openbb.co/api/v1/schemas/v2/telemetry.FeedbackEvent
```

### Runtime Benefits
```python
# Negotiate best schema version
schema = await registry.get_schema(
    "telemetry.FeedbackEvent",
    prefer="v2",    # Try v2 first
    fallback="v1"   # Fall back to v1 if needed
)

# Validate payloads dynamically
is_valid, errors = await registry.validate_payload(schema, data)
```

### Migration Benefits
- Smooth v1 → v2 transitions
- Schema versioning without code changes
- Centralized schema management
- Compatibility checking

## 📈 Integration Effort

**Current State** (70% blocked):
- **Time**: ~11 hours
- **Status**: ⚠️ 7 of 8 tasks blocked by missing prerequisites

**When Ready** (0% blocked):
- **Time**: ~8.5 hours
- **Status**: ✅ All tasks unblocked
- **Difficulty**: 🟡 Medium (straightforward patterns)

---

## 🚦 Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Status | ETA |
|--------------|--------|-----|
| Registry Service deployed | ❌ Not Ready | 2-3 weeks |
| `core-registry-client` on PyPI | ❌ Not Ready | 1-2 weeks |
| v1.0.0 production validation | ⏰ In Progress | 1-2 weeks |
| Store Phase 11.0B complete | ❌ Not Started | 2-3 weeks |

---

## 🎬 Phased Rollout (When Ready)

### Week 1: CI/CD Only
- Fetch schemas from Registry in tests
- No runtime changes
- **Risk**: 🟢 Very Low

### Week 2: Runtime Read-Only
- Load schemas at startup
- Cache with 5-minute TTL
- Log validation results (don't enforce)
- **Risk**: 🟢 Low

### Week 3: Soft Validation
- Validate all payloads
- Log failures + emit metrics
- Still process invalid payloads
- **Risk**: 🟢 Low

### Week 4: Full Enforcement
- Reject invalid payloads
- DLQ captures failures
- Force v2 adoption
- **Risk**: 🟡 Medium (coordinate with Store)

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics (When Integrated)

- ✅ CI fetches schemas from Registry (not Core repo)
- ✅ Cache hit rate >95%
- ✅ Schema fetch latency <100ms (p95)
- ✅ No production incidents
- ✅ <1% performance impact

---

## ⚡ Quick Wins While Waiting

1. **Monitor v1.0.0 Production**
   - Collect Pulse integration metrics
   - Validate stability
   - Build confidence in fresh release

2. **Review Integration Patterns**
   - Study Registry integration guide
   - Plan caching strategy
   - Identify critical schemas

3. **Track Ecosystem Progress**
   - Watch for Registry deployment announcement
   - Monitor Store integration progress
   - Test `core-registry-client` when published

4. **Prepare Infrastructure**
   - Document current schema usage
   - Plan CI/CD workflow updates
   - Design monitoring dashboards

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Minimal CI Integration

If you want to start earlier with lower risk:

**Option**: CI-Only Integration (No Runtime Changes)
- **When**: After SDK published (~1-2 weeks)
- **Time**: ~3 hours
- **Benefits**: Test Registry patterns, prepare for full integration
- **Risk**: 🟢 Very Low (CI only)
- **Limitation**: No runtime benefits yet

---

## 💬 Open Questions for Core Team

1. **Timeline**: When will Registry Service be deployed to production?
2. **SDK**: When will `core-registry-client` be published to PyPI?
3. **SLAs**: What are Registry Service latency/uptime guarantees?
4. **Schemas**: Are v2 schemas finalized or still in preview?
5. **Fallback**: Recommended strategy if Registry is down?

---

## 📝 Recommendation

**NOW** (Current Week):
- ✅ Monitor v1.0.0 in production
- ✅ Review integration guide
- ✅ Track Registry deployment
- ✅ Wait for ecosystem readiness

**2-3 WEEKS** (When Prerequisites Met):
- ✅ Start Phase 11.0B integration
- ✅ Follow phased rollout plan
- ✅ Target v1.1.0 release

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Don't rush integration before Registry is ready
- ❌ Don't add dependencies that don't exist yet
- ❌ Don't destabilize fresh v1.0.0 release

---

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**Phase 11.0B is well-designed and will provide significant value**, but the timing isn't right yet. Let the ecosystem mature:

1. **Registry Service** needs production deployment
2. **Client SDK** needs publication
3. **v1.0.0** needs production validation
4. **Store** needs to integrate first (publishes schemas we consume)

**Revisit in 2-3 weeks when prerequisites are met.**

**Status**: ⚠️ **DEFER** — Not a "no," just "not yet"
