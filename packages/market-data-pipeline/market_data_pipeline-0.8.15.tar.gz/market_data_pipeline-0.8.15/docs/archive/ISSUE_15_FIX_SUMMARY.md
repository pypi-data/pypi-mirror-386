# Issue #15 Fix Summary

## Issue Description

**Issue #15:** ðŸŸ¡ StatusAggregator calls `runtime.status()` but UnifiedRuntime doesn't have that method

- **Severity:** Non-critical but gives wrong info
- **Behavior:** Caught by try/except, returns error instead of status

## Root Cause

The `UnifiedRuntime` class was missing the `status()` and `health()` methods that were documented and planned in Phase 5.0.5c but never implemented. According to the documentation in `docs/PHASE_5.0.5b_README.md`, these methods were supposed to:

1. `status()` - Get runtime status information
2. `health()` - Aggregate health checks from both classic and DAG runtime implementations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `status()` Method

**Location:** `src/market_data_pipeline/runtime/unified_runtime.py`

**Functionality:**
- Returns runtime status including mode, started state, and state string
- Attempts to gather status from underlying implementation (Classic or DAG facade)
- Gracefully degrades if implementation status unavailable
- Never raises exceptions - returns error information in response

**Return Format:**
```python
{
    "mode": "dag" | "classic",
    "started": bool,
    "state": "running" | "stopped",
    # Optional fields based on implementation:
    "implementation": {...},  # If impl has status method
    "pipelines": [...],       # For classic mode with pipeline list
    "dag_runtime": "active",  # For DAG mode
    "implementation_error": str  # If error occurred gathering impl status
}
```

### 2. Added `health()` Method

**Location:** `src/market_data_pipeline/runtime/unified_runtime.py`

**Functionality:**
- Returns structured health information suitable for monitoring systems
- Aggregates health from underlying implementation when available
- Returns appropriate status: `OK`, `DEGRADED`, or `ERROR`
- Components-based health model for detailed diagnostics

**Return Format:**
```python
{
    "status": "OK" | "DEGRADED" | "ERROR",
    "mode": "dag" | "classic",
    "started": bool,
    "components": [
        {
            "name": "dag_runtime" | "classic_runtime",
            "status": "OK" | "DEGRADED" | "ERROR",
            "details": {...} | "error": str
        }
    ],
    # When not started:
    "message": "Runtime not started"
}
```

### 3. Added Comprehensive Tests

**Location:** `tests/unit/unified_runtime/test_facade.py`

Added 4 new tests:
- `test_status_method_not_started` - Verify status() when runtime stopped
- `test_status_method_started` - Verify status() when runtime started
- `test_health_method_not_started` - Verify health() when runtime stopped
- `test_health_method_started` - Verify health() when runtime started

**Test Results:** âœ… All 10 unified_runtime tests pass

### 4. Created Example

**Location:** `examples/runtime_status_example.py`

Demonstrates proper usage of the new `status()` and `health()` methods with clear output showing the information returned in various states.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Graceful Degradation
Both methods never raise exceptions when checking implementation status. If the underlying facade doesn't have status/health methods, they return basic information based on the runtime's own state.

### 2. Async Methods
Both methods are async to allow for future expansion where gathering status might require I/O operations (e.g., querying databases or remote services).

### 3. Dict Return Type
Using plain dictionaries rather than custom DTOs for flexibility and ease of serialization to JSON for APIs and monitoring systems.

### 4. Health Status Levels
- `ERROR` - Runtime not started or critical failure
- `DEGRADED` - Runtime started but implementation reports issues
- `OK` - Runtime started and all components healthy

## Backwards Compatibility

âœ… **Fully backwards compatible**
- No existing methods modified
- Only added new optional methods
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No breaking changes to public API

## Testing Summary

## Files Modified

1. **src/market_data_pipeline/runtime/unified_runtime.py**
   - Added `async def status(self) -> dict` method (33 lines)
   - Added `async def health(self) -> dict` method (63 lines)

2. **tests/unit/unified_runtime/test_facade.py**
   - Added 4 new test functions (105 lines)

3. **examples/runtime_status_example.py** (NEW)
   - Created example demonstrating new methods (73 lines)

## Usage Example

```python
from market_data_pipeline.runtime.unified_runtime import UnifiedRuntime
from market_data_pipeline.settings.runtime_unified import UnifiedRuntimeSettings

# Create runtime
settings = UnifiedRuntimeSettings(...)
runtime = UnifiedRuntime(settings)

# Check status at any time
status = await runtime.status()
print(f"Runtime is {status['state']} in {status['mode']} mode")

# Check health for monitoring
health = await runtime.health()
print(f"Overall health: {health['status']}")
for component in health['components']:
    print(f"  - {component['name']}: {component['status']}")
```

## Impact

- âœ… **Issue #15 RESOLVED:** UnifiedRuntime now has `status()` method
- âœ… **Bonus:** Also added `health()` method for better monitoring
- âœ… **Documentation Alignment:** Implemented planned Phase 5.0.5c features
- âœ… **Monitoring Support:** Enables status aggregation for monitoring systems
- âœ… **No Breaking Changes:** Fully backwards compatible

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add `status()` and `health()` methods to `_ClassicFacade` and `_DagFacade` for more detailed implementation-specific information
2. Integrate with FastAPI `/health` endpoint in `src/market_data_pipeline/runners/api.py`
3. Add Prometheus metrics based on health status
4. Create Grafana dashboard panel for runtime health visualization

## Verification

Run the example:
```bash
python examples/runtime_status_example.py
```

Run the tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/unified_runtime/ -v
```

Both should complete successfully with all tests passing.
