# Pull Request: Phase 8.0C - Cross-Repo Orchestration

## 📋 Summary

This PR implements **Phase 8.0C: Cross-Repo Orchestration (Fan-Out & Matrix)** for the `market_data_pipeline` repository. It adds GitHub Actions workflows and contract tests to enable automatic compatibility testing whenever `market-data-core` publishes contract changes.

**Branch**: `feat/phase-8.0c-cross-repo` → `base`

## ✅ Test Results

### Local Testing

All contract tests pass:

```bash
pytest tests/contracts/ -v

# Results:
# tests/contracts/test_core_install.py . [ 10%]
# tests/contracts/test_feedback_flow.py .... [ 50%]
# tests/contracts/test_protocol_conformance.py ..... [100%]
# ============================= 10 passed in 3.98s ==============================
```

### Coverage

Contract tests cover:
- ✅ Core package imports (telemetry, protocols)
- ✅ Enum values (BackpressureLevel.ok/soft/hard)
- ✅ DTO structure (FeedbackEvent, RateAdjustment)
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Protocol implementations (RateController, FeedbackPublisher)
- ✅ Method signatures (apply, publish)
- ✅ Transformation logic (FeedbackEvent → RateAdjustment)
- ✅ Scale factor mapping (ok=1.0, soft=0.7, hard=0.0)
- ✅ Async operations
- ✅ Required fields validation

## 🔄 Integration Flow

### Current State
- ✅ Pipeline workflows created and tested
- ✅ Contract tests passing locally
- ⚠️ Waiting for Core team's `fanout.yml` implementation

### End-to-End Flow (Once Core Implements Their Side)

```
market-data-core (PR with contract changes)
  │
  ├─ contracts.yml runs (exports schemas)
  │       ↓ (success)
  └─ fanout.yml triggers (automatic)
          │
          ├─► market_data_pipeline/dispatch_contracts.yml
          │   └─ Installs Core@SHA, runs tests/contracts/
          │   └─ Reports: ✅ or ❌
          │
          ├─► market-data-store/dispatch_contracts.yml
          └─► market-data-orchestrator/dispatch_contracts.yml
```

### Manual Testing Available Now

Even without Core's fan-out:

1. Go to Actions → dispatch_contracts
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter `core_ref`: `v1.1.0` (or any Core version)
4. Verify tests pass against that version

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

**None**. This PR is purely additive:
- No changes to existing code
- No changes to existing tests
- Only adds new workflows and contract tests
- Existing integration tests remain comprehensive

## 📝 Post-Merge Actions

### Required (Manual, 5 minutes)

**Create and add `REPO_TOKEN` secret**:

1. **Create GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta
   - Name: `REPO_TOKEN`
   - Expiration: 90 days
   - Permissions:
     - ✅ Actions: Read and write
     - ✅ Contents: Read
     - ✅ Workflows: Read and write
   - Generate token

2. **Add Secret to Repository**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/mjdevaccount/market_data_pipeline/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `REPO_TOKEN`
   - Value: `ghp_...` (paste token)
   - Add secret

3. **Set Rotation Reminder**:
   - Calendar event for 80 days from now
   - Task: Rotate REPO_TOKEN

**Note**: Without this secret, automatic triggers from Core won't work. Manual triggers will still work.

### Recommended

**Coordinate with Core Team**:
- Notify Core team that Pipeline is ready
- Request test trigger from Core's side
- Verify end-to-end flow works

## 💡 Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Extracted, Not Duplicated**: Contract tests are extracted from existing integration tests, not rewritten
2. **Minimal Subset**: Only critical compatibility checks, not comprehensive testing
3. **Fast Execution**: Optimized for CI speed (< 2 min)
4. **Manual Testing First**: Can be tested independently before Core integration

### Technical Highlights

1. **Python 3.11**: Matches project standard
2. **Pip Caching**: Speeds up workflow execution
3. **Git Installation**: Core installed from git at exact ref
4. **pytest Integration**: Uses existing test infrastructure

### Future Enhancements

- Add status comments back to Core PRs (optional)
- Implement matrix testing across multiple Core versions
- Add Slack/email notifications for failures
- Consider GitHub App tokens for longer-lived credentials

## ❓ Q&A

### Why separate workflows?
- **_contracts_reusable.yml**: Logic shared between dispatch and potential matrix
- **dispatch_contracts.yml**: Entry point for external triggers

### Why new tests instead of reusing integration tests?
- **Speed**: Contract tests run in ~4s vs ~30s for integration
- **Focus**: Only critical compatibility, not comprehensive functionality
- **CI Cost**: Minimize GitHub Actions minutes usage

### Why not wait for Core team?
- **Independence**: We can implement and test our side now
- **Parallel Work**: Core team can work on their side simultaneously
- **Manual Testing**: We can verify compatibility manually anytime

### What if tests fail?
1. Check Core changelog for breaking changes
2. Review Core migration guide
3. Update Pipeline code to match new contracts
4. Re-run tests locally
5. Commit fix and push
