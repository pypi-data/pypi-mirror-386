"""Group name resolver for mapping between logical and physical capture group names."""
from typing import KeysView


class GroupNameResolver:
    """
    Bidirectional mapping between logical (user-defined) and physical (auto-generated) group names.

    This resolver manages the mapping between human-readable logical names and
    auto-generated physical names used internally by log-surgeon. One logical name
    can map to multiple physical names (one-to-many), while each physical name maps
    to exactly one logical name (one-to-one in reverse).

    The resolver is used to:
    - Generate unique physical names for each capture group
    - Resolve physical names back to user-friendly logical names
    - Support multiple instances of the same logical capture group

    Example:
        >>> resolver = GroupNameResolver("CGPrefix")
        >>> phys1 = resolver.create_new_physical_name("user_id")  # "CGPrefix0"
        >>> phys2 = resolver.create_new_physical_name("user_id")  # "CGPrefix1"
        >>> resolver.get_logical_name(phys1)  # "user_id"
        >>> resolver.get_physical_names("user_id")  # {"CGPrefix0", "CGPrefix1"}
