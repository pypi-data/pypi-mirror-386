## Getting Started

### Installation

First, ensure Astrora is installed:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended - 10-100x faster than pip)
uv pip install astrora

# Or using pip
pip install astrora

# Install Jupyter
uv pip install jupyter
# or: pip install jupyter
```

### Running the Notebooks

#### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook (Classic)

```bash
# Navigate to the notebooks directory
cd notebooks/

# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Your browser will open - click on a notebook to start!
```

#### Option 2: JupyterLab (Modern Interface)

```bash
# Install JupyterLab
uv pip install jupyterlab

# Start JupyterLab
jupyter lab
```

#### Option 3: VS Code

If you use VS Code:
1. Install the "Jupyter" extension
2. Open any `.ipynb` file
3. Click "Select Kernel" and choose your Python environment
4. Run cells interactively!

### Recommended Learning Path

**For Beginners:**
1. Start with `01_quickstart.ipynb`
2. Progress through notebooks sequentially (01 â†’ 02 â†’ 03 â†’ 04 â†’ 05)
3. Experiment with modifying code examples
4. Complete exercises in each notebook

**For Experienced Users:**
- Jump directly to notebooks matching your interest
- `03_maneuvers_transfers.ipynb` for mission planning
- `04_visualization_plotting.ipynb` for creating plots
- `05_advanced_techniques.ipynb` for performance-critical applications

**For Educators:**
- Use notebooks as teaching materials
- Modify examples for your curriculum

## Dependencies

All notebooks require:
- **astrora** - The main library
- **numpy** - Array operations
- **astropy** - Units and time handling
- **matplotlib** - 2D plotting
- **plotly** - 3D interactive visualization

Optional but recommended:
- **jupyterlab** - Modern Jupyter interface
- **ipywidgets** - Interactive widgets

Install all dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install astrora numpy astropy matplotlib plotly jupyterlab ipywidgets
```

## Tips for Success

### Running Code Cells
- Press `Shift + Enter` to run a cell and move to the next
- Press `Ctrl + Enter` to run a cell and stay on it
- Press `Alt + Enter` to run a cell and insert a new one below

### Troubleshooting

**Kernel dies or crashes:**
- Restart kernel: `Kernel â†’ Restart`
- May indicate memory issue with large datasets
- Try reducing `n_samples` in Monte Carlo examples

**Import errors:**
```python
# Check if astrora is installed
import sys
print(sys.executable)  # Should match your virtual environment

# Reinstall if needed
!pip install --force-reinstall astrora
```

**Plots not showing:**
```python
# Ensure matplotlib inline backend is active
%matplotlib inline

# For interactive plots, try:
%matplotlib widget
```

**Slow performance:**
- Ensure you're using the Rust-compiled version of astrora
- Check that `maturin develop --release` was used during installation
- Reduce `n_samples` or `n_steps` for faster execution

### Best Practices

1. **Always run cells in order** - Later cells depend on earlier ones
2. **Restart kernel if confused** - Fresh start eliminates state issues
3. **Modify and experiment** - Best way to learn is by doing!
4. **Save your work** - Notebooks auto-save, but use `Ctrl+S` frequently
5. **Add your own notes** - Edit markdown cells to add annotations

| RK4 propagation step | ~5 Î¼s | ~100 Î¼s | **20x** |
| Lambert solver | ~3 Î¼s | ~100 Î¼s | **33x** |
| Batch operations (1000x) | ~2 ms | ~100 ms | **50x** |
| Monte Carlo (10000 samples) | ~0.5 s | ~10 s | **20x** |

**Key insight:** Rust shines for batch operations and repeated calculations!
