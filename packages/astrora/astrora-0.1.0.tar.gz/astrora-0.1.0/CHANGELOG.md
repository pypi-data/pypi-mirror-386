   - This CHANGELOG: Add release date to `[Unreleased]` section

2. **Create git tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release version x.y.z"
   git push origin vx.y.z
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Build wheels for Linux (x86_64, x86, aarch64, armv7) + musllinux
   - Build wheels for macOS (Intel x86_64, Apple Silicon aarch64)
   - Build wheels for Windows (x64, x86)
   - Build source distribution (sdist)
   - Run tests on all platforms
   - Publish to PyPI using trusted publishing (OpenID Connect)
   - Create GitHub release with notes

4. **After release**:
   - Update `[Unreleased]` section in CHANGELOG
   - Announce on community channels
   - Monitor PyPI for download statistics

### Manual Release (if needed)

```bash

maturin build --release

# Publish to PyPI (requires PyPI credentials)
uv publish dist/*

# Or use maturin directly
maturin upload
```
