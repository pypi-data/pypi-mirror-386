# Pokemon Red Image-Only Eval Status - ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Status**: All features working! See `EVAL_IMAGE_ONLY_COMPLETE.md` for full details.

---

# Original Status (Before Turso Integration)

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. Image-Only Input Mode
- Successfully modified `task_app.py` to support `use_vision` and `image_only_mode` config flags
- When enabled, sends only base64-encoded PNG frames to the LLM (no text observations)
- Similar to Crafter's implementation

### 2. OpenAI API Integration
- Fixed inference URL construction to properly call `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- Added proper Authorization Bearer token handling
- Successfully runs 10 rollouts with `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`

### 3. Eval Configuration
- Created `eval_image_only_gpt4o.toml` config file
- Successfully runs via `synth-ai eval pokemon_red --config ...`
- All 10 seeds complete without errors

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Not Working Yet

### Turso Tracing & Rewards
**Issue**: Pokemon Red doesn't use SessionTracer like Crafter does

**Current State**:
- Pokemon Red returns a basic trace payload (session_id, metadata) for the CLI
- But it doesn't actually create or save to a Turso database
- No `outcome_rewards` table or reward persistence
- No integration with `SessionTracer` from `tracing_v3`

**What Would Be Needed**:
1. Import and initialize `SessionTracer` in Pokemon Red's `rollout_executor`
2. Call `tracer.start_session()` at beginning of rollout
3. Record events during rollout (like Crafter does)
4. Call `tracer.record_outcome_reward()` at end with:
   - `total_reward`: sum of step rewards
   - `achievements_count`: count of milestones reached
   - `total_steps`: number of steps taken
   - `reward_metadata`: dict with map_id, party_count, badges, etc.
5. Call `tracer.end_session()` to persist to database

### Reward Computation
**Current State**:
- Pokemon Red has a `PalletTownProgressionCompositeReward` reward function
- It tracks milestones like leaving bedroom, getting starter Pokemon, etc.
- But rewards are currently all 0.0 (expected - task is hard with only 10 turns and image-only input)

**What's Challenging**:
- The Pallet Town sequence requires:
  - Navigating multiple rooms
  - Talking to NPCs (pressing A at right moments)
  - Selecting starter Pokemon
  - Entering first battle
- With only images (no text hints) and 10 LLM calls, agents struggle to make progress
- May need more turns or better prompting to get non-zero rewards

## üìä Current Results

```
Eval complete: 10 ok, 0 failed
Model: gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18
Seeds: 0-9 (10 rollouts)
Mean reward: 0.000
Outcome score: 0.000

All rollouts: ~21 steps, 0 rewards, Map 38 (Red's bedroom)
```

## üîß Files Modified

1. **`task_app.py`**:
   - Added `use_vision` and `image_only_mode` support in `_call_inference`
   - Fixed OpenAI API URL construction
   - Added basic trace payload generation
   - **Still needs**: SessionTracer integration for Turso persistence

2. **`eval_image_only_gpt4o.toml`** (new):
   - Config for image-only evaluation
   - 10 seeds, 10 max turns per episode
   - GPT-4o mini with vision enabled

## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Turso Integration

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Minimal Tracing)
Just save basic session info without full event tracing:
```python
# At start of rollout_executor
from synth_ai.tracing_v3 import SessionTracer, StorageConfig, StorageBackend

tracer = SessionTracer(
    storage_config=StorageConfig(
        backend=StorageBackend.TURSO_NATIVE,
        connection_string=f"file:{os.getenv('SQLD_DB_PATH', 'traces/v3/pokemon_red.db')}"
    ),
    auto_save=True
)
await tracer.initialize()
session_id = await tracer.start_session(metadata={...})

# At end of rollout_executor
await tracer.record_outcome_reward(
    total_reward=int(total_reward),
    achievements_count=len(milestone_events),  # or 0 if none
    total_steps=len(steps),
    reward_metadata={
        "final_map": final_state.get("map_id"),
        "party_count": final_state.get("party_count", 0),
        "badges": final_state.get("badges", 0),
        "milestone_events": milestone_events,
    }
)
await tracer.end_session()
```

### Option 2: Full Tracing (Like Crafter)
Integrate complete event tracing like Crafter's rollout.py:
- Record messages, timesteps, events for each step
- More complex but provides rich trace data
- Would require more significant refactoring

## üìù Comparison with Crafter

| Feature | Crafter | Pokemon Red |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Image-only mode | ‚úÖ Working | ‚úÖ Working |
| OpenAI API | ‚úÖ Working | ‚úÖ Working |
| Eval CLI | ‚úÖ Working | ‚úÖ Working |
| SessionTracer | ‚úÖ Integrated | ‚ùå Not integrated |
| Turso database | ‚úÖ Saves traces | ‚ùå No database created |
| outcome_rewards | ‚úÖ Persisted | ‚ùå Not saved |
| Foreign keys | ‚úÖ Working | ‚ùå N/A |
| Non-zero rewards | ‚úÖ 7/10 rollouts | ‚ùå 0/10 rollouts |

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Image-only input mode for Pokemon Red
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API integration with proper auth
- ‚úÖ Eval CLI runs 10 rollouts successfully
- ‚úÖ Basic trace payload returned (for CLI)

**Not Yet Complete**:
- ‚ùå Turso database persistence
- ‚ùå outcome_rewards table with foreign keys
- ‚ùå SessionTracer integration
- ‚ùå Queryable rewards by seed

**To match Crafter's capabilities**, Pokemon Red needs SessionTracer integration (Option 1 or 2 above).
