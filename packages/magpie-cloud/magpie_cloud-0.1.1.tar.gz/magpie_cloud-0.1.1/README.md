# Magpie Python SDK

The official Python SDK for Magpie Cloud. Create runtime workers and code sandboxes with a simple, intuitive API. Build ephemeral batch jobs, long-lived development environments, or stateful workflows without managing infrastructure yourself.

Visit [magpiecloud.com](https://magpiecloud.com) for more information.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install magpie-cloud
```

The package targets Python 3.9+. Install it inside a virtual environment when possible.

---

## Getting Started

```python
from magpie import Magpie

client = Magpie(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

All SDK methods return plain data classes (`pydantic` models) or Python dictionaries. The `jobs` resource is central for launching workloads and inspecting their lifecycle.

## Job Modes at a Glance

| Flag | Default | What it controls | Typical use cases |
| ---- | ------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| `persist` | `False` | Keeps the VM alive after the script exits | Interactive/dev shells, long-running services |
| `stateful` | `False` | Mounts a reusable `/workspace` disk between runs | CI caches, incremental builds |
| `ip_lease` | `False` | Allocates a routable IPv6 address for SSH/http access | Remote editors, port forwarding, health checks |

**Choosing the right combination**

- **Ephemeral jobs (`persist=False`, `stateful=False`)** — fast one-shot tasks such as CI steps, data transforms, smoke tests.
- **Stateful batches (`stateful=True`)** — pipelines that reuse build artifacts or cached data stored in `/workspace` between runs.
- **Persistent VMs (`persist=True`)** — development sandboxes or services that must continue running (often together with `ip_lease=True` for remote access).

You can mix `stateful` with `persist` if you want a long-lived VM and a durable disk.

---

## Example: Ephemeral Job (default flags)

```python
from magpie import Magpie

client = Magpie(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.jobs.create(
    name="hello-world",
    script="echo 'Hello from Magpie!'",
    vcpus=2,
    memory_mb=512,
)

request_id = response["request_id"]

# Poll until the job finishes
status = client.jobs.wait_for_completion(request_id, timeout=180)
print(status.status, status.exit_code)

# Fetch logs
logs = client.jobs.get_logs(request_id)
for entry in logs:
    print(entry.timestamp, entry.message)

# Summarise the result
result = client.jobs.get_result(request_id)
print(result.success, result.logs)
```

Use this mode for short jobs that can start fresh every time.

---

## Example: Persistent VM with IPv6 + SSH

Persistent VMs keep running after the initial script exits. Combine `persist=True` and `ip_lease=True` to receive an IPv6 address and execute SSH commands. The backend manages authentication so your users only need the job ID.

```python
from magpie import Magpie

client = Magpie(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

handle = client.jobs.create_persistent_vm(
    name="dev-shell",
    script="echo ready",
    poll_timeout=180,
    poll_interval=3,
)

print("Job ID:", handle.request_id)
print("Assigned IPv6:", handle.ip_address)

# Run ssh commands
result = client.jobs.ssh(handle.request_id, "uname -a")
print("exit:", result.exit_code)
print("stdout:\n", result.stdout)

# Execute another command (commands can run concurrently from your client)
client.jobs.ssh(handle.request_id, "mkdir -p /workspace/app && ls -la /workspace")
```

**When to use this pattern**
- Remote development environments
- Always-on demos and staging servers
- Long-running background jobs where you need to periodically run maintenance commands

`client.jobs.ssh` returns only after the remote command finishes (or the timeout is reached). Issue parallel SSH commands from separate coroutines/threads to run them concurrently.

---

## Example: Stateful Workspace (persisting `/workspace`)

Stateful jobs attach a named block device mounted at `/workspace`. The disk survives between runs as long as you reuse the same `workspace_id`.

```python
client = Magpie(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# First run creates the workspace
initial = client.jobs.run_and_wait(
    name="init-cache",
    script="echo 'counter=0' > /workspace/state.txt",
    vcpus=2,
    memory_mb=512,
    stateful=True,
    workspace_size_gb=5,
)

workspace_id = initial.request_id

# Subsequent run reuses the disk
second = client.jobs.run_and_wait(
    name="increment",
    script="""
    source /workspace/state.txt
    counter=$((counter + 1))
    echo "counter=${counter}" > /workspace/state.txt
    echo "Counter is now ${counter}"
    """,
    stateful=True,
    workspace_id=workspace_id,
)
print(second.logs)
```

Use stateful workspaces for build caches, dependency layers, or any workflow that benefits from keeping files between job runs without holding the VM open.

---

## Inspecting Jobs

- `client.jobs.get_status(request_id)` — lightweight status poller.
- `client.jobs.get_vm_info(request_id)` — returns VM metadata (IDs, IPv6/IPv4) for persistent jobs.
- `client.jobs.get_logs(request_id)` — grabs the accumulated log buffer.
- `client.jobs.stream_logs(request_id)` — generator that streams logs in real time (useful from a CLI or TUI).
- `client.jobs.cancel(request_id)` — best-effort cancellation for running jobs.

---

## Job Templates

Templates let you save a script definition, then launch runs with custom environments or parameters.

```python
template = client.templates.create(
    name="csv-to-parquet",
    description="Convert uploaded CSV to Parquet",
    script="""
    python3 <<'PY'
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv('/workspace/input.csv')
    df.to_parquet('/workspace/output.parquet')
    PY
    """,
    vcpus=4,
    memory_mb=2048,
)

run = client.templates.run(
    template.id,
    environment={"SOURCE_URL": "https://example.com/data.csv"},
)
print(run.id, run.status)
```

Templates are great for self-service portals or repeating scheduled workloads.

## Advanced Tips

- **Environment variables** — pass a dict via the `environment` field to inject secrets or parameters into the VM.
- **File uploads** — upload artifacts using the `/api/v1/jobs/files` endpoints (see SDK helpers or Postman collection) and consume them inside the job.
- **Combining modes** — you can run a persistent VM *and* make it stateful by setting both `persist=True` and `stateful=True` with a `workspace_id`.
- **Timeouts** — `jobs.wait_for_completion` takes `timeout` and `poll_interval`; `jobs.ssh` accepts `timeout` per command.
- **Concurrency** — Magpie Cloud processes API requests in parallel. Fire multiple `jobs.ssh` calls or even launch several jobs at once from your client code.

---

## Where Magpie Fits In

- **CI / automation** — ephemeral jobs with `persist=False` for isolated build or test steps.
- **Data pipelines** — stateful jobs to reuse bulky datasets without re-downloading every run.
- **Interactive dev boxes** — persistent, IP-leased VMs that you reach over SSH or Web IDEs.
- **Fleet management / maintenance** — trigger commands on persistent VMs using `jobs.ssh` for backups, package upgrades, or ad-hoc diagnostics.
