# Fast Vindex: A faster version of Dask's vindex for advanced indexing with arrays.

*fast-vindex* is a faster and more flexible alternative to Dask's built-in `vindex` function, designed to improve performance when working with complex or high-dimensional array indexing.

```{warning}
While `fast-vindex` aims to offer significant performance improvements over Daskâ€™s built-in `vindex`, it does **not currently support all features** of the official implementation.

For a detailed list of supported indexing patterns and limitations, please refer to the [Supported Features](#supported-features) page.
```
