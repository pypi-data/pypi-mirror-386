# This file demonstrates the usage of MicroControllerInterface with custom ModuleInterface classes.
#
# Note that this example is intentionally kept simple and does not cover all possible use cases. If you need a more
# complex example, check one of the Sun Lab libraries used for scientific data acquisition. Overall, this example
# demonstrates how to use the PC client to control custom hardware modules running on the microcontroller in real time.
# It also demonstrates how to access the data received from the microcontroller, that is saved to disk via the
# DataLogger class.
#
# This example is intended to be used together with a microcontroller running the module_integration.cpp from the
# companion ataraxis-micro-controller library: https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller#quickstart
# See https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-communication-interface#quickstart for more details.

    # higher than the theoretically expected 3 and 20. This is because the modules are fast enough to start an extra
