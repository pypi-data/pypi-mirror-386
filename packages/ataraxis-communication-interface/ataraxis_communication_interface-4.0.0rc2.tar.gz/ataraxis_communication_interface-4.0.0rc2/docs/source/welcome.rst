Welcome to ataraxis-communication-interface API documentation page
==================================================================

ataraxis-communication-interface is a Python library that provides the centralized interface for exchanging commands
and data between Arduino and Teensy microcontrollers and host-computers.

This library is part of the broader 'Ataraxis' science-automation project, developed in the
`Sun (NeuroAI) lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University. It has a companion library written
in C++, `ataraxis-micro-controller <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller>`_, intended for
Arduino and Teensy microcontrollers managing user-defined custom hardware modules.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this library. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions and library usage examples:
