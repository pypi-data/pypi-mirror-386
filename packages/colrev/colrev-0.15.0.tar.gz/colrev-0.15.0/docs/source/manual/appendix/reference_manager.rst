Reference managers
==================================

The goal of CoLRev is to take care of the data management in a review project end-to-end. In particular, it supports highly iterative searches and it features mechanisms to update existing records, for example when they are retracted, when forthcoming papers are published (assigned to a volume), and when time-variant fields like citation counts change. More importantly, it tightly integrates with CoLRev curations, feeding back corrections of metadata and retrieving updates from the community.

Instead of importing hundreds or thousands of papers into a reference manager, CoLRev offers the possibility to automatically export the sample of relevant papers in the analysis and synthesis step (:doc:`see instructions in the data operation </manual/data/data>`). This makes it easy to collaborate in teams that rely on a particular reference manager like Endnote or Citavi.
