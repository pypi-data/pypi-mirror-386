Dear Dr. {{ author_name }},<br><br>
We are currently writing a literature review.<br>
During our search process your {{ record.data.get('year', 'TODO') }} publication "{{ record.data.get('title', 'TODO') }}" ({{ record.data.get('journal', 'TODO') }}) caught my attention.<br>
Unfortunately, my home institution does not provide access to it. I was wondering whether you could send me a copy.<br>
Thank you in advance.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br><br>
{{ signed }}<br>
