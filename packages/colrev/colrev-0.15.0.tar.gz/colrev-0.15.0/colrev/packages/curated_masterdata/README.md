## Steps and operations

To create a new masterdata curation, run

```
colrev init --type colrev.curated_masterdata
# add crossref
colrev search --add "crossref:jissn=123456"
# add further sources (like DBLP)

```

<!--
### Problem formulation
-->

### Metadata retrieval

- All SearchSources should correspond to metadata-SearchSources (e.g., retrieving the whole journal from Crossref), i.e., the linking to metadata-SearchSources is disabled in the prep operation.
- The curation endpoint supports the specification of ``masterdata_restrictions``, defining the name of the outlet, whether volume or issue fields are required (for which time-frame).
- Dedicated dedupe endpoints are activated.
