# FTS

**FTS** (File Transfer System) is a lightweight CLI tool for file transfers, chatrooms, and more.
It’s designed for fast local-network sharing, simple chat creation, and utility management in a single binary.

The github repo may be found [here](https://github.com/Terabase-Studios/fts)

> \[!CAUTION]
> FTS should NEVER be run on a public network without permission from the **proper authorities**; there are safeguards in place to prevent fts from running on public networks

## Features

* Fast local-network file transfers (files or directories)
* Lightweight chatrooms for easy communication
* Discover and manage libraries for easy file sharing
* Aliases and default settings for quick operations
* Progress bars, rate limiting, and background servers
* Security via trusted connections and public-network safeguards
* Uses TLS to prevent man in the middle attacks
* Library does not expose the computers actual file system in anyway

> [!IMPORTANT]
> FTS has currently only been tested on Windows. Other operating systems may not be supported.

## Installation

Install FTS globally using pip:

```bash
pip install fts-tool
````

To uninstall:

```bash
pip uninstall fts-tool
```

> \[!WARNING]
> Python must be installed and added to your system PATH to run `fts` from the terminal.

---

## Usage

```bash
fts  [--logfile FILE] [-q] [-v] COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

Run `fts -h` to see all global options.
Each command has its own `-h/--help` flag.

> \[!CAUTION]
> FTS is executed as `fts` in the terminal, but the pip package is named `fts-tool`.

---

## Example Use

```bash
# Start server
fts open downloads --progress

# Send a file
fts send C:\Users\Public\Pictures\family_photo.png 192.168.1.42 --progress
```
One computer opens the sever and the other sends the file

## Project State

FTS development is temporarily slowed but will resume in 2–4 weeks. The project is very much alive.

### Upcoming Features

* Address any remaining issues in the current Windows build.
* Include troubleshooting tips (e.g., firewall or network issues).
* Support for common Linux systems.
* Limit FTS usage on public networks instead of disabling it entirely.
* Improve support for directory aliases in the GUI.
* Implement file checksums to detect corrupted transfers.
* Add scheduled or automated file transfers.
* Enable transfer resuming for interrupted downloads.
* Allow third-party extensions (e.g., custom compressors, encryption layers, notifications).

## Commands

### `open`

Start a server and listen for incoming transfers.

```bash
fts open OUTPUT_PATH [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

* `OUTPUT_PATH` — Directory to save incoming transfers (required)

**Options:**

* `-d, --detached` — Run server in the background
* `-l, --limit SIZE` — Transfer rate limit (e.g. `500KB`, `2MB`, `1GB`)
* `-x, --extract` — Automatically extract transferred archives
* `--progress` — Show progress bars during operations
* `-p, --port PORT` — Override port used (0-65535)
* `--ip ADDR` — Restrict requests to IP or hostname

---

### `send`

Send a file to a target host.

```bash
fts send PATH IP [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

* `PATH` — File to send (required)
* `IP` — Target IP or hostname (required)

**Options:**

* `-n, --name NAME` — Send file under a different name
* `-p, --port PORT` — Override port used (0-65535)
* `-l, --limit SIZE` — Transfer rate limit Transfer rate limit (e.g. `500KB`, `2MB`, `1GB`)
* `--nocompress` — Skip compression (faster, larger transfers)
* `--progress` — Show progress bars

> \[!NOTE]
> FTS automatically skips compression for files that are already compressed. Enable this option only if FTS still attempts to compress such files.
---

### `send-dir`

Send a directory recursively.

```bash
fts send-dir PATH IP [OPTIONS]

**Options:**

* `-n, --name NAME` — Send directory under a different name
* `-p, --port PORT` — Override port used (0-65535)
* `-l, --limit SIZE` — Transfer rate limit Transfer rate limit (e.g. `500KB`, `2MB`, `1GB`)
* `--pyzip` — Use Python’s built-in compression instead of OS-level compression
* `--progress` — Show progress bars

> [!WARNING]
> The target directory will rezip after every send request;
> If this becomes a problem, it is recommended to **pre-zip** directories.
