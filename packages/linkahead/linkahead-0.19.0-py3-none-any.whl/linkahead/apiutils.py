    """Compare two entities.

    Returns two dicts listing the differences between the two entities. The
    order of the two returned dicts corresponds to the two input entities.
    The dicts contain two keys, 'parents' and 'properties'. The list saved
    under the 'parents' key contains those parents of the respective entity
    that are missing in the other entity, and the 'properties' dict contains
    properties and SPECIAL_ATTRIBUTES if they are missing or different from
    their counterparts in the other entity.

    The key used to represent a parent in the parent list or a
    property in the property dictionary is the entity's name if the
    name is present for both compared entities, the id otherwise.

    The value of the properties dict for each listed property is again a dict
    detailing the differences between this property and its counterpart.
    The characteristics that are checked to determine whether two properties
    match are the following:

    - datatype
    - importance
    - value

    If any of these characteristics differ for a property, the respective
    string (datatype, importance, value) is added as a key to the dict of the
    property with its value being the characteristics value,
    e.g. {"prop": {"value": 6, 'importance': 'SUGGESTED'}}. Except: None as
    value is not added to the dict.
    If a property is of type LIST, the comparison is order-sensitive.

    Comparison of multi-properties is not yet supported, so should either
    entity have several instances of one Property, the comparison is aborted
    and an error is raised.

    Two parents match if their name and id are the same, any further
    differences are ignored.

    Should records referenced in the value field not be checked for equality
    between the entities but for equivalency, this is possible by setting the
    parameter compare_referenced_records.

    Params
    ------
    entity0:                    Entity
                                First entity to be compared.
    entity1:                    Entity
                                Second entity to be compared.
    compare_referenced_records: bool, default: False
                                If set to True, values with referenced records
                                are not checked for equality but for
                                equivalency using this function.
                                compare_referenced_records is set to False for
                                these recursive calls, so references of
                                references need to be equal. If set to `False`,
                                only the Python objects are compared, which may
                                lead to unexpected behavior.
    entity_name_id_equivalency: bool, default: False
                                If set to True, the comparison between an
                                entity and an int or str also checks whether
                                the int/str matches the name or id of the
                                entity, so Entity(id=100) == 100 == "100".

    """
    # ToDo: Discuss intended behaviour
    # Questions that need clarification:
    #    - What is intended behaviour for multi-properties and multi-parents?
    #    - Do different inheritance levels for parents count as a difference?
    #    - Do we care about parents and properties of properties?
    #    - Should there be a more detailed comparison of parents without id?
    #    - Revisit filter - do we care about RecordType when matching?
    #      How to treat None?
    #    - Should matching of parents also take the recordtype into account
    #      for parents that have a name but no id?
    # Suggestions for enhancements:
    #    - For the comparison of entities in value and properties, consider
    #      keeping a list of traversed entities, not only look at first layer
    #    - Make the empty_diff functionality faster by adding a parameter to
    #      this function so that it returns after the first found difference?
    #    - Add parameter to restrict diff to some characteristics
    #    - Implement comparison of date where one is a string and the other is
    #      datetime
