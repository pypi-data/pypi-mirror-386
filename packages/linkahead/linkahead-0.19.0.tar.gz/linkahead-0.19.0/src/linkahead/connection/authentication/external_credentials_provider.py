    Abstract subclass of PlainTextCredentialsProvider which should be used to
    implement external credentials provider (e.g. pass, keyring, or any other call
    to an external program, which presents the plain text password, which is to be
    used for the authentication.

    Parameters
    ----------
    callback: Function
        A function which has **kwargs argument. This funktion will be called
        each time a password is needed with the current connection
        configuration as parameters.

        ----------
        **config
            Keyword arguments containing the necessary arguments for the

        Attributes
        ----------
        password : str
            The password. This password is not stored in this class. A callback
            is called to provide the password each time this property is
