# Python Image scraper using selenium
Image scraper to download images by a user given query in google images.

This is purely a learning exercise and is meant to be useful for dataset creation for training an image classifier model that will be made soon enough, that being said I hate image scraping so much.

Please note that as webscraping is a new field for me, claude was used in providing suggestions such as cookies handling functionality and in helping me implement the undetected chromedriver.

Installation tools will be coming soon (once I embarassingly get my pypi account activated).

Plan to add: multithreading for faster downloads (probably?).
