## Localization

Unfortunately, the free account of Crowdin cannot create a second integration, and the premium account is too expensive for me to afford :(

If there is a localization problem with the WebUI, please raise an issue.

Do not raise localization issues of AkariBot here, you should go to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/akari-bot).
