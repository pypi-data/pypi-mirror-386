# Graphical User Interface

## Introduction
FocusStack processes focus-bracketed images in two phases:
* **Project**: Batch processing (alignment/balancing/stacking)
* **Retouch**: Layer-based refinement
> [!NOTE]
> Advanced processing details in [main documentation](main.md).

The batch processing supports image alignment, color and luminosity balance, vignetting removal,
noisy pixel masking.

## Starting

* The python package can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/shinestacker/) using ```pip```:

```console
> pip install shinestacker
```
 Onace installed, the GUI app can start either from a console command line :

```console
> shinestacker
```

* The app can be dowloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/lucalista/shinestacker/releases):
   - Windows: as installer or  ```zip``` archive for local installation
   - macOS: as ```dmg``` disk image, where the app can be dragged to the Application folder
   - Linux: as ```tar.gz``` archive

The GUI has two main working areas: 

* *Project* 
* *Retouch*

Switching from *Project* to *Retouch* can be done from the *ShineStacker* main menu.

## Project area

When the app starts, it proposes to create a new project.

### Creating Projects
1. Select source folder (JPEG/TIFF 8/16-bit)
2. Configure job actions (auto-saved in project file)
3. Run processing:
   - Real-time logs & progress bar
   - Thumbnail previews for each stage

> **Large Set Tip**: For 100+ images:
> - Split into 10-15 image "bunches" 
> - Set number of overlapping frame from consecutive bunches
> - Combine intermediate results later

The newly created project consists of a single job that contains more actions.
Each action produces a folder as output that has, by default, the action's name.
Some actions can be combined in order to produce a single intermediate output (alignment, balancing, etc.).

> **Pro Tip**: Duplicate jobs when processing similar image sets to save configuration time. You can run multiple jobs in sequence.

It is possible to run a single job, or all jobs within a project.

### Project Run Tabs

1. Job progress bar with CPU and RAM usage monitor
2. Real-time log viewer
3. Retouch button (enabled after processing)

When the job finishes, a *Retouch* button is enabled, which opens the output image into the retouch area.

### Brush Properties
Adjust in the top toolbar:
- **Size**: Brush diameter (px)
- **Hardness**: Edge softness (0-100%)
- **Opacity**: Paint transparency
- **Flow**: Paint accumulation rate

> üí° Pro Tip: Use low opacity/flow (20-40%) for subtle corrections

### Retouch Workflow

1. **Navigate**: 
   - Zoom/pan to defect area
   - Toggle between master/source (`X`)
2. **Correct defects/artifacts**:**:
   - Select source layer with clean area
   - Adjust brush properties (size/hardness/opacity)
   - Paint over defects
   - Use `Ctrl+Z` to undo strokes
3. **Verify**:
   - Toggle master view (`M`) to check results
   - Compare before/after with `L`/`M` toggle
4. **Filters**:
   - Improve the final image with sharpening, denoise and color balance
5. **Export**:
   - ‚úÖ Final image: Single TIFF/JPEG 
   - üóÇÔ∏è Editable: Multilayer TIFF (large)

| Action              | Shortcut                  |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Zoom in/out         | `Ctrl` + `+`/`- or mouse wheel or pinch on touchpad |
| Reset view          | `Ctrl` + `0`              |
| Pan                 | `Space` + mouse drag or two fingers on touchpad   |
| Prev./next layer    | `Up`/`Down` arrows        |
| View master layer   | `M`                       |
| View source layer   | `L`                       |
| Toggle master ‚Üî layer | `T`                       |
| Temp. toggle master ‚Üî source | `X`                    |

See help menu for complete list of shortcuts.

**Export Formats**:
- Single TIFF: Final image (highest quality)
- Single JPEG: For web and quick preview (lower quality)
- Multilayer TIFF: Preserves all layers (large file)

**EXIF metadata**:
* EXIF data can be imported from source images and saved with final file.
