## Interactive GUI

The graphical interface makes complex stacking tasks simple:
- **Project View** ‚Äì Configure, preview, and run stacking workflows with optional intermediate results.
- **Retouch View** ‚Äì Manually refine the final image by blending details from selected frames and applying filters.

Ideal for users who want the power of scripting and the comfort of a modern UI.

## Acknowledgements & References

The first version of the core focus stack algorithm was inspired by the

by Sami Jawhar, used under permission. The implementation in the latest releases 
was rewritten from the original code.
