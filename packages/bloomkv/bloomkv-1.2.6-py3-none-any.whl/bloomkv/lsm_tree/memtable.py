"""
Memtable implementation for LSM Tree.
This is an in-memory data structure that stores key-value pairs.
It is used to buffer writes before they are flushed to disk.
It uses a SortedDict to maintain sorted order of keys. Usually it is a self balancing BST, but sortedcontainers gives us the same functionality with a simpler API.
It also tracks the approximate size of the memtable in bytes.
It uses a threshold to determine when to flush the memtable to disk.
It supports basic operations like put, get, delete, and checking if the memtable is full.
It also supports clearing the memtable after flushing.
It uses a tombstone object to represent deleted values.
Data from here is written to the SSTable on disk.
