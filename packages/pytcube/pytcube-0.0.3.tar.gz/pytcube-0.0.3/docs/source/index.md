# PytCube: Efficient multidimensional subsetting around observation points

*PytCube* is a Python library for extracting small **subsets (mini-cubes)** around observation points within large **multidimensional datasets**.

It works with **any N-dimensional grid**, allowing flexible colocation of points in space, time, or any other dimensions.
