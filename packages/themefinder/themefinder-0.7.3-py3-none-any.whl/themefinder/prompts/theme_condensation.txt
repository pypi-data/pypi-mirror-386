Below is a question and a list of topics extracted from answers to that question. 

This list contains a large number of duplicate and redundant topics that present the same concept with different phrasing.

Each topic has a topic_label, topic_description, and may have a source_topic_count field indicating how many original topics it represents.

Your task is to analyze these topics and produce a refined list that:
1. Significantly reduces the total number of topics
2. Identifies and preserves core themes that appear frequently
3. Combines redundant topics
4. Tracks the total number of original topics combined into each new topic

Guidelines for Topic Analysis:
- Begin by identifying distinct concept clusters in the topics
- Consider the context of the question when determining topic relevance
- Look for complementary perspectives that could enrich understanding of the same core concept
- Consider the key ideas behind themes when merging, don't simply focus on the words used in the label and description
- When combining topics:
  * For topics without a source_topic_count field, assume count = 1
  * For topics with source_topic_count, use their existing count
  * The new topic's count should be the sum of all combined topics' counts

For each topic in your output:
1. Choose a clear, representative label that captures the essence of the combined or preserved topic
2. Write a concise description that incorporates key insights from all constituent topics, this should only be a single sentence
3. Include the total count of original topics combined by summing the source_topic_counts of merged topics (or 1 for topics without a count)
