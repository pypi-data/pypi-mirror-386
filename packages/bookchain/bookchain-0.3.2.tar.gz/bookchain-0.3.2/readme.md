# BookChain

BookChain is an accounting library that provides a cryptographic audit trail of
every identity, ledger, account, transaction, and entry to ensure data
integrity. It also uses the tapescript package to ensure account security and
reject invalid transactions if controls are configured on the involved accounts.
Included are tools for establishing correspondent credit relations as well as
accomplishing basic bookkeeping tasks.

This package uses
[sqloquent](https://pypi.org/project/sqloquent) for database persistence,
[tapescript](https://pypi.org/project/tapescript) for authorization, and
[packify](https://pypi.org/project/packify) for deterministic encoding.

## Status

All initially planned features have been implemented and tested.

Open issues can be found [here](https://github.com/k98kurz/bookchain/issues).

The async implementation has an upstream issue from the sqloquent dependency
that can be tracked [here](https://github.com/k98kurz/sqloquent/issues/16). Once
that is fixed, the dependency will be updated, and this notice will be removed.

## Overview

This library provides an accounting system using sqloquent for persistence,
packify for deterministic encoding, tapescript for authorization, and the
classic rules of double-entry bookkeeping. All entries and transactions have
deterministic content IDs determined by hashing the relevant contents, and the
inclusion of tapescript allows for Bitcoin-style locking and unlocking scripts
to encode access controls at the account level.

### Class organization

`Currency` represents a currency/unit of account for a `Ledger`. It includes the
number of subunits to track and optionally the base for conversion to decimal
(defaults to 10), FX symbol, prefix symbol, and/or postfix symbol to be used with
the `format` method (e.g. `USD.format(1200)` could result in "12.00 USD",
"$12.00", or "12.00$", respectively). It also includes `to_decimal` method for
formatting int amounts into `Decimal`s, and `get_units` method for getting a
tuple of whole units and remainders.

`Identity` represents a legal person or other entity that can sign contracts
or engage in transactions. It includes the name, details, and optionally public
key bytes and private key seed bytes.

`Ledger` represents a general ledger for a given `Identity` using a specific
`Currency`. It includes a name, a `LedgerType`, the `Identity` id, and the
`Currency` id. `LedgerType` is an enum representing the valid ledger types,
either `PRESENT` or `FUTURE` for cash and accrual accounting, respectively, or
for other uses the package user may define.

`Account` represents an account for a given `Ledger`. It includes a name, a type
(one of the `AccountType` enum options), the `Ledger` id, an optional locking
script for access control, and optional details.

`AccountCategory` represents a category for `Account`s. It includes a name, a
`LedgerType`, and a destination (str description; e.g. "Balance Sheet" or
"Profit and Loss").

`AccountType` is an enum representing the valid account types. The options are
`DEBIT_BALANCE`, `ASSET`, `CONTRA_ASSET`, `CREDIT_BALANCE`, `LIABILITY`,
`EQUITY`, `CONTRA_LIABILITY`, and `CONTRA_EQUITY`.

`Entry` represents an entry in the general ledger for a given `Account`. It
includes a type (one of the `EntryType` enum options), an amount, a nonce, the
`Account` id, and optional details.

`EntryType` is an enum representing the valid entry types. The options are
CREDIT and DEBIT.

`Transaction` represents a transaction made of `Entry`s. It includes the `Entry`
ids, `Ledger` ids, a timestamp, details, and the auth script(s). Each
`Transaction` must include entries that balance the number of credits and debits
applied to each ledger affected by the transaction. Use `Transaction.prepare` to
prepare a transaction -- it will raise validation errors if the transaction is
not valid -- then call `.save()` on the result to persist it to the database.
Transactions in the database can be validated by using `.validate()`, which will
return `True` if it is valid and `False` if it is not (it will also raise errors
in some situations that require more information about the validation failure).

`TxRollup` represents a rollup of `Transaction`s. It commits the `Transaction`
ids into a Merkle tree and includes the root hash, timestamp, optional details,
aggregate account balance changes of the committed `Transaction`s, the
`TxRollup` id of the parent `TxRollup` (or `None` for the genesis `TxRollup`),
the height of the `TxRollup` (number of `TxRollup`s in the chain), and the
`Correspondence` id or `Ledger` id. Inclusion proofs for `Transaction`s can be
generated using the `TxRollup.get_inclusion_proof` method and verified using
the `TxRollup.verify_inclusion_proof` method; the latter requires only the
`tx_root`, but the former requires the full list of `tx_ids`.

`ArchivedEntry` and `ArchivedTransaction` are optional classes for storing the
trimmed `Entry`s and `Transaction`s, respectively, after they have been included
in a `TxRollup`. The default behavior of `TxRollup.trim` is to use these archive
classes, but `trim(False)` can be used to prevent archiving. (The trimmed txns
and entries will be retrievable by using `TxRollup.trimmed_transactions` and
`TxRollup.trimmed_entries`, respectively, but they are not optimized for ease of
use.)

`Correspondence` represents a correspondent credit relationship between several
`Identity`s.

- `Identity` has many `Ledger`s and is within `Correspondence`s
- `Ledger` belongs to `Identity` and `Currency`, has many `Account`s, is within
  `Transaction`s, and has many `TxRollup`s
- `Account` belongs to `Ledger` and `AccountCategory`, and has many `Entry`s
- `AccountCategory` has many `Account`s
- `Entry` belongs to `Account` and is within `Transaction`s
- `Transaction` contains `Ledger`s and `Entry`s
- `Correspondence` contains `Identity`s and has many `TxRollup`s
- `TxRollup` belongs to `Correspondence` or `Ledger` and belongs to and has one
  `TxRollup`
- `ArchivedTransaction` contains `ArchivedEntry`s
- `ArchivedEntry` belongs to `Account` and is within `ArchivedTransaction`s

### Cryptographic audit trail

Models inherit from `sqloquent.HashedModel`, so all data is hashed into the ID,
guaranteeing a unique, deterministic ID for each unique record.

Whenever something is deleted, it will be encoded and inserted into the
`deleted_models` table to maintain an audit trail.

Accounts may be created with locking scripts, which will require associated
Entries to provide valid auth scripts. These scripts are executed using
tapescript. If some tapescript runtime values are required for validation,
e.g. cache or plugins, they can be saved in Transaction.details and passed to
`Transaction.validate` and `Account.validate_script`.

`TxRollup`s include a `tx_root` which is the root hash of the Merkle tree of
the `Transaction`s they contain. This allows for efficient inclusion proofs
(`TxRollup.get_inclusion_proof`) and verification of the presence of a
`Transaction` in a `TxRollup` (`TxRollup.verify_inclusion_proof`). `TxRollup`s
made for a `Correspondence` will require an `auth_script` if the
`Correspondence` contains a `txru_lock` or if the `Identity`s each have a
pubkey (a 2-of-2 multisig lock will be generated as the default `txru_lock` if
one was not set). This system allows for old `Transaction`s to be trimmed from
the local database while ensuring that all parties validated the aggregate
account balance changes of the trimmed `Transaction`s were preserved.

## Installation and Setup

Install with `pip install bookchain`. If you want to use the async version,
instead install with `pip install bookchain[asyncql]`.

Once installed, use the following to setup your project as appropriate:

```python
import bookchain

bookchain.publish_migrations(folder_for_migration_files)

bookchain.automigrate(folder_for_migration_files, db_file_path)

bookchain.set_connection_info(db_file_path)
```

To use the async version:

```python
import bookchain
import bookchain.asyncql

bookchain.publish_migrations(folder_for_migration_files)

bookchain.automigrate(folder_for_migration_files, db_file_path)

bookchain.asyncql.set_connection_info(db_file_path)
```

The `bookchain.publish_migrations` function can be passed a callback that
takes the str model name and str migration file contents, and returns the
modified str migration file contents. This can be used to modify the migration
file contents before they are written to disk. For example, if you wanted to
modify the `Account` migration file to add a unique constraint to the `name`
column, you could do the following:

```python
def migration_callback(name: str, m: str) -> str:
    if name == 'Account':
        return m.replace("t.text('name').index()", "t.text('name').unique()")
    return m

bookchain.publish_migrations(path_to_migrations_folder, migration_callback)
```
