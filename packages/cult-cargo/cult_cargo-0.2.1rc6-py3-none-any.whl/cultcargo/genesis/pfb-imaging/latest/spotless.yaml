  alpha:
    default: 2
    dtype: float
    info: Controls how aggressively the l1reweighting is applied. Larger values correspond
      to more agressive reweighting.

    default: self,db1,db2
    dtype: str
    info: 'Wavelet bases to use. Give as comma separated str eg. '
  cell-size:
    dtype: float
    info: Cell size in arc-seconds
  diverge-count:
    default: 5
    dtype: int
    info: Will terminate the algorithm if the rms increases this many times. Set to
      larger than niter to disable this check.
  eta:
    default: 1.0
    dtype: float
    info: Value to add to Hessian to make it invertible
  field-of-view:
    abbreviation: fov
    dtype: float
    info: Field of view in degrees
    metavar: DEG
  gamma:
    default: 1.0
    dtype: float
    info: Step size of update
  hess-approx:
    abbreviation: hess-approx
    choices:
    - wgt
    - psf
    - direct
    default: direct
    dtype: str
    info: Which Hessian approximation to use. Set to wgt for vis space approximation,
      psf for zero-padded image space approximation and direct for direct inversion.
  hess-norm:
    abbreviation: hess-norm
    dtype: float
    info: Spectral norm of hessian approximation
  l1-reweight-from:
    default: 5
    dtype: int
    info: L1 reweighting will kick in either at convergence or after this many iterations.
      Set to a negative value to disbale L1 reweighting.
  l2-reweight-dof:
    default: 3.5
    dtype: float
    info: The degrees of freedom parameter for performing L2 reweighting. L2 reweighting
      is triggered if L1 reweighting is active and convergence is reached and will
      be applied a maximum of max-l2-reweight times.
  l2-reweight-from:
    default: 10
    dtype: int
    info: Start doing L2 reweights from this iteration onwards. L2 reweights will
      also be triggered if the algorithm converges, L1 reweighting has already kicked
      in and l2-reweight-dof is set.
  max-l2-reweight:
    default: 5
    dtype: int
    info: The maximum number of L2 reweighting steps.
  mds:
    info: Optional explicit path to mds. Set using output-filename, product and suffix
      by default.
  niter:
    abbreviation: niter
    default: 10
    dtype: int
    info: Number of iterations.
  nlevels:
    abbreviation: nlevels
    default: 3

    info: Number of x pixels
  ny:
    dtype: int
    info: Number of y pixels
  overwrite:
    default: false
    dtype: bool
    info: Hard reset the cache
  positivity:
    default: 1
    dtype: int
    info: 'How to apply positivity constraint

      0 -> no positivity

      1 -> normal positivity constraint

      2 -> strong positivity i.e. all pixels in a band > 0

      '

    abbreviation: psfo
    default: 1.0
    dtype: float
    info: Size of PSF relative to dirty image
  rmsfactor:
    default: 1.0
    dtype: float
    info: By default will threshold by rmsfactor*rms at every iteration
  robustness:
    abbreviation: rob
    default: 0.5
    dtype: float
    info: Robustness factor for Briggs weighting. None means natural
  suffix:
    default: main
    dtype: str
    info: Can be used to specify a custom name for the image space data products
