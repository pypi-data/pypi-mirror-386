# Reminder for PyPI uploading (currently manual).
#  - Delete any existing dist/ folder.
#  - Install twine if don't have it: pip install twine
#  - Upgrade build if needed: python -m pip install --upgrade build
#  - python -m build
#  - twine check dist/*
#  - Test with PyPI until it looks good, but note you can't install from there
#    because it's missing dependencies
#      twine upload -r testpypi dist/* -u __token__ -p <TestPyPI API token>
#  - Once it is greenlighted, upload to PyPI
#      twine upload dist/* -u __token__ -p <PyPI API token>
#  - Tag the branch with the corresponding version
#  - Delte the dist/ folder.
