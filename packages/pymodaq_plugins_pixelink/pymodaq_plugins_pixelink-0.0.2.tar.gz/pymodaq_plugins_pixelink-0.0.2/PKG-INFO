Installation instructions
=========================
* Tested on PyMoDAQ version 5.0.5
* Tested on Windows 11
* Must install Pixelink Capture or Pixelink SDK before use. If you already have a 32 bit install on your PC, uninstall this and reinstall the 64 bit version.
* Config files are needed for different camera models. Example for the PL-B953U camera is given in the resources directory. The name of the config file should be config_<model_name> where model_name is the output of getCameraInfo(cam)[1].ModelName. The module will look for this file in the ProgramData/.pymodaq folder in Windows and if not found, a default config file can be created upon camera initialization.
