    Quobyte driver: The python ``psutil`` module is no longer a requirement for
    cinder, so it may need to be installed separately if you are using Quobyte.
    This can be done by specifying ``quobyte`` extras if installing via pip
    (for example, ``pip install cinder[quobyte]``) or by installing ``psutil``
    from the package appropriate for your operating system and ensuring that
    it is accessible to the cinder volume service.
