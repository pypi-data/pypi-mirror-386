    [Pure Storage] Volume Group support added through new vendor-specific volume type
    extra-specs. Volume Groups can be used to isolate tenant volumes into their own area
    in a FlashArray, and this volume group can have tenant-wide storage QoS for the
    volume group. Full replication support is also available for volumes in volume groups
    and exisitng volume group volumes (such as VMware vVols) can be managed directly.
