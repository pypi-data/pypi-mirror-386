    The NetApp ONTAP driver now supports Certificate-Based-Authentication (CBA)
    for operators that desire certificate based authentication instead of user
    and password.
    Note: The options for cert-auth take precedence, if all the auth options
    are defined in the config (both cert and legacy), the legacy ones are
    ignored.
