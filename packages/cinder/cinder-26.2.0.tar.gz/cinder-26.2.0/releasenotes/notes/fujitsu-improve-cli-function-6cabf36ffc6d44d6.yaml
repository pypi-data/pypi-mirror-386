    Fujitsu Eternus DX driver: Added support SSH key.

    Added the method for connecting to Eternus Storage using SSH key.
    The connection method can be selected by setting the value of parameter
    ``fujitsu_passwordless``, which has a default value of ``True``.

    * When ``fujitsu_passwordless`` is set to ``True``, SSH key is used for
      connecting to the storage. Additionally, ``fujitsu_private_key_path``
      needs to be set to the path of the SSH private key.

    * When ``fujitsu_passwordless`` is set to ``False``, password is used for
      SSH connection to the storage.

    See the `Fujitsu ETERNUS DX driver documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/drivers/fujitsu-eternus-dx-driver.html>`_
    for details.

    Fujitsu Eternus DX driver: Added SSH key and password connection switching

    Added the method for connecting to Eternus Storage using SSH key.
    The connection method can be selected by setting the value of parameter
    ``fujitsu_passwordless``, which has a default value of ``True``.

    For upgrading from previous versions that relied on password authentication,
    you must explicitly set ``fujitsu_passwordless = False`` in the
    configuration. This ensures backward compatibility with the legacy
    password-based workflow.

    The default True value enforces key-based auth for new deployments, aligning
    with security best practices at the cost of a minor configuration adjustment
    for existing users.
