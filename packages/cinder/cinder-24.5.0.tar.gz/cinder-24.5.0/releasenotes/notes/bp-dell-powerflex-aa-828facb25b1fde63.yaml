    Dell PowerFlex driver:
    Enabled cinder volume active/active support.
    This allows users to configure Dell PowerFlex backends
    in cinder clustered environments.
    **Note that** active/active support is specific to
    OpenStack volume services as PowerFlex storage replication
    is asynchronous.
