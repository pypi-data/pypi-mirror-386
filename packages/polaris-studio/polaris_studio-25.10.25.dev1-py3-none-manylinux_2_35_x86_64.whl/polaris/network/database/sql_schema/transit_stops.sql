--@ Lists all the transit stops in the model on which at least one transit trip
--@ stops during the day. It  lists the agency it is associated to, as well as
--@ the closest network link to it
--@
--@ Additionally to transit stops, this table also holds nodes in the network
--@ associated with the active networks (walk and bike), more specifically the
--@ nodes created in the network to allow transit stops to be linked in what was
--@ previously the middle of a network link.

--@ If a node had to be moved during the GTFS map-matching (probably due to a
--@ too-sparse of a network), then the moved_by_matching field will contain the
--@ straight-line distance the stop was moved.


-- TODO: *link*, *dir*, *offset*, setback** and those for coordinates x/y/z should have the same treatment
