--@ This table holds the list of each unique timing configuration *timing_id* for each signal in the model.
--@
--@ The signal the timing refers to is defined in *signal* and the identifier of the the timing among the other
--@ available for this signal is defined in *timing*.
--@
--@ The field *phases* identifies the number of corresponding records on **Timing_Nested_Records**, where *object_id*
--@ would be equal to this table's *timing_id*.
--@
--@ *cycle* defines the total cycle time for this semaphore timing plan.
--@
--@ For now, *offset* is always equal to 0
