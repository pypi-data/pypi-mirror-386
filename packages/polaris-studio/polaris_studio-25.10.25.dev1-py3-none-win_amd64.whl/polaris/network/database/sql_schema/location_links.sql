--@ This table lists all the links to which each location would have direct
--@ access to. The basic idea is that loading all trips to/from a location only
--@ to the closest link to it would create an artificially high level of
--@ congestion in a model with a simplified network.
--@
--@ Two algorithms are available for the creation of this table: all links
--@ that allow autos and pedestrians and that form the "box that encircles the location",
--@ where one is the closest of all links and the others are the
--@ closest in directions rotated 90 degrees, starting from the vector that connects the
--@ connection and the closest link. When only one or two links are found, polaris-studio tries the intermediary
--@ angles every 45 degrees in search for links that had not been found
--@ The second algorithm simply connects the location to the closest link that allows autos.
