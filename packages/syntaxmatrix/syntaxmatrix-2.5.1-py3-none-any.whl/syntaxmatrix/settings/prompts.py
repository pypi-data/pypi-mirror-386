    Content & Formatting Blueprint (Adhere Strictly):
    Structure your response using the following elements as appropriate for the topic. Prioritize clarity and information density. If the query is not a question or if there is no context: generate an appropriate general response based on your training knowledge.
    else if the query is a question:
    1. Generate a response to the given query based on the given user context and/or system context.
    2. Use the chat history to stay relevant.
    3. You must always respond in a conversational tone and do not Hallucinate.
    4. Determine whether based on the query, you should generate a list, table, or just plain text response.
    5. If the response is plain text, each sentence must begin on a new line - use the <br> tag.
    6. If the query is a question that requires a list or table, you must generate the content in the appropriate format.
    7. Use clear, hierarchical headings if the response is longer than a paragraph.
    8. Be direct and concise. Avoid unnecessary fluff or repetition.
    9. Lead with your key conclusion or answer in the first sentence.
    10. Support your answer with clear, factual points.
    
    ────────  FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS ───────────────
        1. Decide which of the following layouts best fits the content:
            • Comparison across attributes or (Key:Value) pairs → HTML <table>. 
            • When creating a table, adhere to the following styling instructions:
                a. First, declare 3 colors: c1="#EDFBFF", c2="#CCCCCC", c3="#E3E3E3".
                b. The generated table must be formatted so that table cells have border lines.
                c. The table head (<thead>) must always have a background color of c1.
                d. The rest of the rows in the table body (<tbody>) must alternate between 2 background colors, c2 and c3 (striped).
            • Use bullet points for simple lists of items, features → HTML <ul>
            • Use ordered (numbered or step-by-step) list for sequences or steps in a process → HTML <ol>
        2. Keep cells/list items concise (one fact or metric each).  
        3. All markup must be raw HTML. Avoid using markdown symbols like **asterisks** or _underscores_ for emphasis.
        4. Do not wrap the answer inside triple back-ticks.
        6. If emphasis is needed, use clear language (e.g., "It is important to note that...").
        7. Use horizontal lines (<hr>) sparingly to separate distinct sections.
        8. The final output should be professional, easy to scan, and ready to be pasted into a document or email.

    SyntaxMatrix Overview
    SyntaxMatrix is a battle-tested Python framework that accelerates AI application development from concept to production, slashing engineering overhead by up to 80%. By packaging UI scaffolding, prompt orchestration, vector search integration, and deployment best practices into a cohesive toolkit, SyntaxMatrix empowers teams—from lean startups to enterprise R&D—to deliver AI-powered products at startup speed and enterprise scale._
    ____________________________________
    Goals & Objectives
    •	Rapid Prototyping
    Enable teams to spin up interactive AI demos or internal tools in minutes, not weeks, by providing turnkey components for chat interfaces, file upload/processing (e.g., extracting text from PDFs), data visualization, and more.
    •	Modular Extensibility
    Offer a plug-and-play architecture (via syntaxmatrix.bootstrap, core, vector_db, file_processor, etc.) so you can swap in new vector databases (SQLite, pgvector, Milvus), LLM backends (OpenAI, Google’s GenAI), or custom modules without rewriting boilerplate.
    •	Best-Practice Defaults
    Bake in industry-standard patterns—persistent history stores, prompt-template management, API key handling, session management—while still allowing configuration overrides (e.g., via default.yaml or environment variables).
    •	Consistency & Reproducibility
    Maintain a unified UX across projects with theming, navbar generation, and widget libraries (display.py, widgets), ensuring that every AI application built on the framework shares a consistent look-and-feel.
    ________________________________________
    Target Audience
    •	AI/ML Engineers & Researchers who want to demo models, build knowledge-base assistants, or perform exploratory data analysis dashboards.
    •	Startups & Product Teams looking to deliver customer-facing AI features (chatbots, recommendation engines, content summarizers) with minimal infrastructure overhead.
    •	Educators & Students seeking a hands-on environment to teach or learn about LLMs, vector search, and prompt engineering without dealing with full-stack complexities.
    ________________________________________
    Solution: SyntaxMatrix Framework
    SyntaxMatrix unifies the entire AI app lifecycle into one modular, extensible package:
    •	Turnkey Components: Pre-built chat interfaces, file-upload processors, visualization widgets, email/SMS workflows.
    •	Seamless LLM Integration: Swap freely between OpenAI, Google Vertex, Anthropic, and self-hosted models via a unified API layer.
    •	Plug-and-Play Vector Search: Adapters for SQLite, pgvector, Milvus—and roadmap for Pinecone, Weaviate, AWS OpenSearch—make semantic retrieval trivial.
    •	Persistent State & Orchestration: Session history, prompt templating, and orchestration utilities ensure reproducibility and compliance.
    •	Deployment-Ready: Industry-standard Docker images, CI/CD templates, Terraform modules, and monitoring dashboards ready out of the box.
    ________________________________________
    Key Features & Example Applications
    •	Conversational Agents & Chatbots: Persistent session history, prompt-profile management, and dynamic prompt instructions make it easy to craft domain-specific assistants.
    •	Document QA & Search: Built-in vectorizer and vector DB adapters enable rapid ingestion of PDFs or knowledge bases for semantic retrieval.
    •	Data Analysis Dashboards: EDA output buffers and plotting utilities (plottings.py, Plotly support) let you surface charts and insights alongside conversational workflows.
    •	Email & Notification Workflows: The emailer.py module streamlines outbound messaging based on AI-driven triggers.
    •	Custom Model Catalogs & Templates: Centralized model_templates.py and settings/model_map.py support quick swapping between LLMs or prompt archetypes.
    ________________________________________
    Why It Matters
    By removing repetitive setup tasks and enforcing a coherent project structure, SyntaxMatrix reduces time-to-market, promotes maintainable code, and democratizes access to sophisticated AI patterns. Developers can stand on the shoulders of a battle-tested framework rather than reinventing the wheel for each new prototype or production system.
    ________________________________________
    Future Directions
    1.	Expanded Vector DB & Embedding Support
        o	Add adapters for Pinecone, Weaviate, or AWS OpenSearch
        o	Support hybrid retrieval (combining sparse and dense methods)
    2.	Multi-Modal & Streaming Data
        o	Integrate vision and audio pipelines for document OCR, image captioning, or speech transcription
        o	Enable real-time data streaming and inference for live-update dashboards
    3.	Deployment & MLOps Tooling
        o	Built-in CI/CD templates, Docker images, and Terraform modules for cloud provisioning
        o	Monitoring dashboards for latency, cost, and usage metrics
    4.	Collaborative & No-Code Interfaces
        o	Role-based access control and multi-user projects
        o	Drag-and-drop prompt editors and pipeline builders for non-technical stakeholders
    5.	Plugin Ecosystem & Marketplace
        o	Community-contributed modules for domain-specific tasks (legal, healthcare, finance)
        o	A registry to share prompt templates, UI widgets, and vector-DB schemas

SMX_PAGE_GENERATION_INSTRUCTIONS = f"""
    0· Parse the Website Description (MANDATORY):\n{SMXAI_WEBSITE_DESCRIPTION}\n\n
    1. Input always contains:
        •	website_description - plain-text overview of the site/company (mission, goals, audience, visual style, etc.).
        •	page_title - the specific page to create (e.g. About, Pricing, Blog).
        Read the entire website_description first. Extract:
        • Brand essence & voice
        • Core goals / differentiators
        • Target audience & pain-points
        • Visual/style cues (colours, fonts, imagery)
        Keep this parsed data in memory; every design and content decision must align with it.
    ________________________________________
    2· Decide Content from the Page Title + Parsed Description
        Common Page Title	Content You Must Provide	Tone (derive exact wording from description)
        About	Mission, vision, origin story, key differentiators, stats/metrics.	Inspirational, credible
        Services / Solutions	Features or modules mapped to goals (e.g., “Turnkey chat interface” → “rapid prototyping”).	Action-oriented
        Blog / Insights	Grid of post cards themed around expertise areas in the description.	Conversational, expert
        Pricing	Tier cards tied to value pillars from description.	Clear, persuasive
        Contact / Demo	Benefits blurb + capture form.	Friendly, concise
        If page_title is something else, improvise logically using the parsed Website Description.
    ________________________________________
    3· Layout & Components (omit header/footer—they're supplied elsewhere)
        1.	Hero section - headline that merges page_title with brand essence, sub-headline reinforcing core value, CTA button.
        2.	Main content - 2-4 subsections drawn from goals/differentiators.
        3.	Optional stat strip - highlight metrics pulled from description.
        4.	CTA banner - final prompt aligned with brand voice.
    ________________________________________
    4· Visual & Interaction Rules
        •	Use colours, fonts, and imagery directly referenced in the parsed description (fallback: dark charcoal, accent colour from description, sans-serif font stack).
        •	CDN tech stack (React 18 UMD + Tailwind CSS).
        •	Prefix all custom ids/classes/functions with smx- (or company-specific prefix derived from description) to avoid clashes.
        •	Subtle animations (fade-in, slide-up, ≤ 400 ms).
        •	Accessibility: semantic HTML, alt text, contrast compliance.
    ________________________________________
    5· Royalty-Free Images
        Fetch from Unsplash/Pexels with keywords that combine “ai, technology” plus any industry cues found in the description (e.g., “healthcare”, “finance”). Provide descriptive alt attributes referencing the brand.
    ________________________________________
    6.	Wrap Everything in a Python Function and Return the HTML
        i.	Function signature (exactly):
            def generate_page_html(website_description: str, page_title: str) -> str:
        ii.	Inside the function
            o Parse website_description and page_title per Steps 0–6.
            o Compose the entire HTML document as a single triple-quoted Python string (page_html = ''' … ''').
            o Return that string (return html).
            o Keep the OpenAI SDK demo call in the page (hidden <script> tag) to satisfy the SDK-usage requirement.
        iii. Function docstring
            '''
            Generate a fully responsive, animated, single-file web page aligned with the
            supplied website description and page title. Returns the HTML as a string.
            ''' 
        iv.	No side effects
            o Do not write to disk or print; just return the HTML.
            o Avoid global variables; everything lives inside the function scope.
        v.	Output format
            o When the LLM responds, it must output only the complete Python source code for generate_page_html - nothing else (no markdown, comments, or explanations outside the code block).

    ________________________________________
    7. Deliverable Checklist
        •	Single .html file (inline CSS/JS; external assets only via CDN & image URLs).
        •	Fully responsive, animated, modern, brand-aligned.
        •	All text and visuals demonstrably reflect the parsed Website Description.
        •	No duplicate header/footer.
        •	All identifiers safely namespaced.
        •	Return only the HTML text—no commentary or extra files.

WEBPAGE_GENERATION_INSTRUCTIONS = (f"""
    Parse the Website Description (MANDATORY):\n{SMXAI_WEBSITE_DESCRIPTION}\n\n
    Prompt (give this to the LLM)
    Role: You are a senior front-end engineer and content designer building a single HTML page for the brand SyntaxMatrix. Produce production‑ready code that can be dropped into an existing Flask/Cloud Run site. Do not include a navbar or a footer; the host site renders them.
                                   
    Objectives:
        1. Output one complete HTML file that is responsive, accessible, and visually polished, matching the SyntaxMatrix theme.
        2. Use a modern stack with Tailwind CSS (CDN), GSAP 3 + ScrollTrigger for tasteful motion, and Lucide for icons. Load the latest stable CDNs.
        3. Provide compelling, concise copy in UK English. Do not use the words: delve, leverage, revolutionary.
        4. Use rich imagery. Prefer locally hosted images via /assets/... when available; otherwise propose two remote candidates per image and include robust fallbacks.
        5. Ensure good a11y (semantic headings, focus states, alt text, ARIA where needed) and respect prefers-reduced-motion.

    Brand & Design Rules:
        1. Primary colour: {{brand.primary_hex}} (SyntaxMatrix blue). Secondary: {{brand.secondary_hex}}. Dark background: {{brand.dark_bg_hex}}.
        2. Typography: Google Fonts Inter (weights 300–800). Use a clean, enterprise style with soft shadows and rounded corners.
        3. Sections to include (in this order unless stated otherwise): {{sections}}. Omit global nav and footer.
        4. Use subtle gradients, grids, or SVG accents that fit the brand.
                                   
    Images & Fallbacks:
        1.For each hero/section image: include a <picture> element with two candidate remote URLs (e.g., Unsplash/Pexels). Add loading="lazy", decoding="async", and referrerpolicy="no-referrer".
        2. Add a JS onerror fallback on the <img> to swap to a neutral placeholder (e.g., https://picsum.photos/seed/syntaxmatrix-{{slug}}/1600/900).
        3. Additionally render an inline SVG placeholder immediately before the <picture> (hidden by default) and toggle it if both remote sources fail.
        4. Write descriptive alt text tailored to the section's message.
                                   
    Animation:
        1. Use GSAP ScrollTrigger to reveal .reveal elements with short, subtle transitions.
        2. Add a small numerical counter animation for any metric figures when they enter the viewport.
        3. Respect prefers-reduced-motion: reduce by disabling animations.
                                   
    Accessibility & SEO:
        1. Proper landmarks (<main>, <section>, <header> inside the page only if needed—not the global site header), logical order of headings, and visible focus styles.
        2. Meta title and description tuned to {{page_name}} and {{audience}}.
        3. Meaningful link text for CTAs.
                                   
    Performance & Quality:
        1. Single file only; no external CSS files. Use Tailwind CDN and a short <style> block for extras.
        2. Optimise images with sensible dimensions and aspect-ratio boxes to prevent layout shift.
        3. No unused libraries. Keep inline JS small and scoped.
    
    Output format:
        Return only the HTML document. No explanations.
    
    HTML Requirements Template (follow this structure):
        1. <!DOCTYPE html> + <html lang="en"> (UK English tone in copy).
        2. <head> with meta, title {{page_name}} — SyntaxMatrix, Inter font, Tailwind CDN, GSAP 3 + ScrollTrigger, Lucide.
        3. Global CSS variables for brand colours; small utility styles; @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) to cut motion.
        4. <body> dark theme, no navbar/footer.
        5. Sections per {{sections}}, including:
            I. Hero: punchy headline, subcopy, primary & secondary CTAs, hero media (picture + fallbacks), animated accent grid.
            II. Value Props / Feature Grid: 3-6 cards with icons and short copy.
            III. Story/Timeline (if requested): ordered items with dates; tasteful line & dots.
            IV. Metrics (if requested): 3-4 counters (.counter[data-target]).
            V. Team or Social Proof (optional): avatars or badges.
            VI. CTA band: strong closing prompt (no footer).
        7. Inline <script> to render Lucide icons and GSAP reveal + counters. Include a defensive image‑fallback helper.
                                   
    Image Helper (include this in the page):
    <script>
        (function(){{
            function fallbackImg(img){{
                if(!img.dataset.fallback){{ img.dataset.fallback = '1'; img.src = img.dataset.fallbackSrc; return; }}
                // Show preceding hidden SVG placeholder if available
                var prev = img.previousElementSibling; if(prev && prev.tagName === 'SVG'){{ prev.style.display = 'block'; }}
                img.style.display = 'none';
            }}
            document.querySelectorAll('img[data-fallback-src]').forEach(function(img){{
                img.addEventListener('error', function(){{ fallbackImg(img); }}, {{ once: true }});
            }});
        }})();
    </script>
                                   
    Example <picture> pattern (use per image):
        <!-- Hidden inline SVG placeholder shown only if external images fail -->
        <svg class="hidden w-full h-full object-cover" viewBox="0 0 1600 900" aria-hidden="true">
