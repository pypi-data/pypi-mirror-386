cd tests && python -m pytest
```

3. Create a Pull Request (PR) üì¨
   Commit your changes: Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
   Push your branch: Push your branch to your fork:
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   Open a PR: Open a pull request from your branch in your fork to the main branch of the kernpy repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes, reference any related issues, and feel free to thank the community for their support! üòä

# Developer notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Add the development dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file.
> - Add the production dependencies to the `pyproject.toml` file.
> - After every change in the grammar, the next steps are mandatory:
> - - Run the `antlr4.sh` script (JAVA required).
> - - Commit & push the changes to the repository.


- Generate antrl4 grammar:
- For generating the Python code required for parsing the **kern files, the shell script `antlr4.sh` inside the `kernpy` package must be run.

```shell
./antlr4.sh
```

Install all the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, install the required packages manually:


- It requires the `antlr4` package to be installed using:
```shell
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime
```


- For visualizing the bounding boxes, the library, the `Pillow` library is required:
```shell
pip install Pillow
```

- To parse a IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) manifest in Python, we use the `requests` library to fetch the manifest file:
```shell
pip install requests
```

- If fetching data from `https` fails, install the following version of `urllib`:
```shell
pip install urllib3==1.26.6
```

It has been tested with version 4.13.1 of the package.
