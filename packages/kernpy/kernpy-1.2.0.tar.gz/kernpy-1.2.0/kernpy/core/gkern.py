This module is responsible for generating the Graphic **kern encoding.

The Graphic **kern encoding (**gkern) is an agnostify **kern encoding. It keeps the original **kern encoding structure \
but replaces the pitches with its graphic representation. So the E pitch in G Clef will use the same graphic \
representation as the C pitch in C in 1st Clef or the A in F in 4th Clef.
