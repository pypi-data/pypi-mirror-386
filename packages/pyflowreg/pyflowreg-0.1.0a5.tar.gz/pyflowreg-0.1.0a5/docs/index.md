**Variational Optical Flow for 2-Photon Microscopy**

## Documentation Status

This documentation is currently **largely AI-generated** and under active development. While we strive for accuracy:

- Some sections may contain errors or outdated information
- Not all features may be fully documented
- Examples and edge cases may be incomplete

**If you encounter mistakes, failing examples, missing features, or unclear documentation, please [report an issue](https://github.com/FlowRegSuite/pyflowreg/issues).**

PyFlowReg provides high-accuracy motion correction for 2-photon microscopy videos and volumetric 3D scans using variational optical flow techniques. Dense motion information is explicitly computed, enabling both motion-corrected output and subsequent motion analysis or visualization.

This is a Python port of the [Flow-Registration MATLAB toolbox](https://github.com/FlowRegSuite/flow_registration), maintaining full algorithmic compatibility while adding modern Python features and optimizations.

## Key Features

- **Variational model** optimized for motion statistics in 2P microscopy
- **Dense motion fields** returned for analysis and visualization
- **Multi-channel support** with automatic weight normalization
- **Parallel processing** with threading and multiprocessing executors
- **Flexible I/O** supporting HDF5, TIFF, MAT, and MDF formats
- **Reference pre-alignment** via cross-correlation for improved robustness
- **MATLAB compatibility** maintaining algorithmic parity with Flow-Registration

## Getting Started

```python
import numpy as np
from pyflowreg.motion_correction import compensate_arr, OFOptions

# Load your 2-photon video (T, H, W, C)
video = np.load("my_video.npy")
reference = np.mean(video[:10], axis=0)

# Configure and run motion correction
options = OFOptions(quality_setting="balanced")
registered, flow = compensate_arr(video, reference, options)
```
