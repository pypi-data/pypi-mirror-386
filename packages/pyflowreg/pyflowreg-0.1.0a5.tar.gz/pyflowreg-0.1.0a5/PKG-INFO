## üöß Under Development

This project is still in an **alpha stage**. Expect rapid changes, incomplete features, and possible breaking updates between releases.

- The API may evolve as we stabilize core functionality.
- Documentation and examples are incomplete.
- Feedback and bug reports are especially valuable at this stage.

Python bindings for Flow-Registration - variational optical-flow motion correction for 2-photon (2P) microscopy videos and volumetric 3D scans.

Derived from the Flow-Registration toolbox for compensation and stabilization of multichannel microscopy videos. The original implementation spans MATLAB, Java (ImageJ/Fiji plugin), and C++. See the [publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/jbio.202100330) and the [project website](https://www.snnu.uni-saarland.de/flow-registration/) for method details and video results.

## Requirements

This code requires python 3.10 or higher.

Initialize the environment with

```bash
mamba create --name pyflowreg python=3.10
mamba activate pyflowreg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or on windows

```bash
pip install -r requirements_win.txt
```

to enable Sutter MDF file support.


## Installation via pip and mamba

```bash
mamba create --name pyflowreg python=3.10
pip install pyflowreg
```

To install the project with full visualization support, you can install it with the ```vis``` extra:

```bash
pip install pyflowreg[vis]
```

## Getting started

This repository contains demo scripts under ```experiments``` and
demo notebooks under ```notebooks```. The demos with the jupiter sequence should run out of the box.

The plugin supports most of the commonly used file types such as HDF5, tiff stacks and matlab mat files. To run the motion compensation, the options need to be defined into a ```OF_options``` object.

The python version of Flow-Registration aims at full MATLAB compatibility, any missing functionality should be reported as an issue. The API is designed to be similar to the original MATLAB code, with some adjustments for Python conventions.


## Development

### Code Quality & Pre-commit Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) for automated code quality checks before each commit. Our hooks are centralized in [FlowRegSuite/flowreg-hooks](https://github.com/FlowRegSuite/flowreg-hooks) for consistency across all FlowRegSuite projects.

**What's checked:**
- Ruff linting and formatting (Python code style)
- NumPy docstring validation (documentation standards)
- README image URLs (PyPI compatibility) are checked and automatically replaced
- YAML/TOML validation and general file hygiene

**Setup:**

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hook scripts
pre-commit install

# Run on all files to check current status
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Alternative installations (without pip):**

If you're using pipx (isolated tool installation):

```bash
# Install pipx if not available
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath

# Install pre-commit via pipx
pipx install pre-commit

# For uv support (optional, if using uv as package installer)
pipx inject pre-commit pre-commit-uv

# Then install hooks as usual
pre-commit install
```

Or using uv's tool management directly:

```bash
# Install uv if not available
pip install uv

# Install pre-commit as an isolated tool
uv tool install pre-commit

# Then install hooks as usual
pre-commit install
```

**Daily usage:**

Simply commit as usual - checks run automatically. Failed hooks show what needs fixing, and many issues are auto-corrected.

```bash
# Manual run when needed
pre-commit run --all-files

# Skip hooks in emergency (use sparingly)
git commit -m "message" --no-verify
```

**Troubleshooting (Windows/Anaconda):**

If you encounter registry or path errors on Windows, try:

```powershell
# Clear pre-commit cache
pre-commit clean

# Set environment variable (if needed)
$env:PROGRAMDATA = "C:\ProgramData"

# Try again
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Updating hooks** (maintainers only):
```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
git add .pre-commit-config.yaml
git commit -m "chore: update pre-commit hooks"
```

### Docstring Standards

We follow NumPy-style docstrings for compatibility with Sphinx documentation. The `numpydoc-validation` hook ensures consistency. See the [NumPy docstring guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) for examples.

## Dataset

The dataset which we used for our evaluations is available as [2-Photon Movies with Motion Artifacts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fPdzQo5SiA-62k4eHF0ZaKJDt1vmTVed?usp=sharing).
