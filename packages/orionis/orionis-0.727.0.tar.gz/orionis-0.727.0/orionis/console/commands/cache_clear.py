class CacheClearCommand(BaseCommand):
    """
    Command to clear Python bytecode cache files (.pyc) and __pycache__ directories in the Orionis application.

    This command helps maintain a clean development environment by removing all Python cache artifacts
    from the current working directory, preventing issues related to stale or invalid bytecode.

    Attributes
    ----------
    timestamps : bool
        Whether to display timestamps in the command output.
    signature : str
        The CLI signature to invoke this command.
    description : str
        A brief summary of the command's functionality.

    Methods
    -------
    handle() -> bool
        Executes the cache clearing process using the `pyclean .` utility. Returns True if successful,
        otherwise raises CLIOrionisRuntimeError on failure.

    def handle(self) -> bool:
        """
        Clears all `.pyc` files and `__pycache__` directories in the current directory using the `pyclean` utility.

        This method invokes the `pyclean .` command to recursively remove Python bytecode cache files and directories,
        helping to ensure a clean state for the Orionis application. If the command fails or an unexpected error occurs,
        a `CLIOrionisRuntimeError` is raised with the relevant error message.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Returns True if the cache was cleared successfully. Raises an exception otherwise.

        Raises
        ------
        CLIOrionisRuntimeError
            If the cache clearing process fails or an unexpected error occurs.
