class Singleton(type):
    """
    Metaclass for implementing thread-safe and async-safe singleton pattern.

    This metaclass ensures that only one instance of a class exists, regardless of
    whether the code is running in a synchronous or asynchronous context. It provides
    both synchronous and asynchronous mechanisms for instance creation, using appropriate
    locking to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded or async environments.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _instances : Dict[Type[T], T]
        Dictionary storing singleton instances for each class using this metaclass.
    _lock : threading.Lock
        Thread lock for synchronizing instance creation in synchronous contexts.
    _async_lock : asyncio.Lock
        Async lock for synchronizing instance creation in asynchronous contexts.

        """
        Synchronously create or retrieve the singleton instance.

        Ensures that only one instance of the class is created in a thread-safe manner.
        If the instance does not exist, acquires a thread lock to prevent race conditions,
        creates the instance, and stores it in the class-level `_instances` dictionary.
        If the instance already exists, returns the existing instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args : Any
            Positional arguments to pass to the class constructor.
        **kwargs : Any
            Keyword arguments to pass to the class constructor.

        Returns
        -------
        T
            The singleton instance of the class.
