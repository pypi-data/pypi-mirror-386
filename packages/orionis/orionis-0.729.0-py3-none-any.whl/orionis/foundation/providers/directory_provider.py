        """
        Registers the directory service as a singleton within the application container.

        This method binds the `IDirectory` interface to its concrete implementation `Directory`
        as a singleton. The binding is associated with a specific alias, ensuring that only one
        instance of `Directory` is created and shared across the application's lifecycle. This
        promotes efficient resource usage and consistent behavior when accessing directory-related
        services.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It performs registration as a side effect.
