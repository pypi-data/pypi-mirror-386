class LogClearCommand(BaseCommand):
    """
    Command to clear all existing log files and directories in the application's log storage.

    This command disables all active loggers, locates the application's log directory,
    and attempts to remove all files, symlinks, and subdirectories within it. If a log
    file is locked, it will be truncated instead of deleted. Any unexpected errors during
    the process will raise a CLIOrionisRuntimeError.

    Parameters
    ----------
    app : IApplication
        The application instance providing access to the log storage path.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Returns True if all log files and directories are cleared successfully,
        or if the log directory does not exist. Raises CLIOrionisRuntimeError
        if an unexpected error occurs during the process.

    Raises
    ------
    CLIOrionisRuntimeError
        If an unexpected error occurs while clearing the log files or directories.

        ------
        CLIOrionisRuntimeError
