        Initialize a new Event instance.

        This constructor sets up the initial state of an Event object, including its
        unique signature, arguments, purpose, and other optional attributes such as
        random delay, start and end dates, trigger, details, listener, and maximum
        instances. These attributes define the behavior and metadata of the event.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signature : str
            A unique identifier for the event. This is required and must be a non-empty string.
        args : list of str, optional
            A list of arguments associated with the event. Defaults to an empty list if None is provided.
        purpose : str, optional
            A human-readable description or purpose of the event. Defaults to None.

        set to None and can be assigned an instance of `IScheduleEventListener` to handle
        event-specific logic.

        set `start_date` and `end_date` attributes. If a random delay (jitter) has been
        configured, it will be applied to the trigger.

        Parameters
        ----------
        hour : int
            The hour of the day when the event should run. Must be in the range [0, 23].
        minute : int, optional
            The minute of the hour when the event should run. Must be in the range [0, 59].
            Default is 0.
        second : int, optional
            The second of the minute when the event should run. Must be in the range [0, 59].
            Default is 0.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Returns True if the scheduling was successfully configured. If the input is invalid,
            a `CLIOrionisValueError` is raised, and the trigger is not set.

        Notes
        -----
        The event will be triggered every three days at the specified time, within the optional
        scheduling window defined by `start_date` and `end_date`. If a random delay (jitter)
        is set, it will be applied to the trigger.

        Schedule the event to run at fixed intervals specified in weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

        This method configures the event to execute repeatedly at a specified interval
        composed of weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. At least one of these parameters
        must be a positive integer. Optionally, the event can be restricted to a time window
        using previously set `start_date` and `end_date`. If a random delay (jitter) has been
        configured, it will be applied to the trigger.

        Parameters
        ----------
        weeks : int, optional
            The interval in weeks. Must be a non-negative integer. Default is 0.
        days : int, optional
            The interval in days. Must be a non-negative integer. Default is 0.
        hours : int, optional
            The interval in hours. Must be a non-negative integer. Default is 0.
        minutes : int, optional
            The interval in minutes. Must be a non-negative integer. Default is 0.
        seconds : int, optional
            The interval in seconds. Must be a non-negative integer. Default is 0.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            True if the interval scheduling was successfully configured. If the input
            is invalid, a `CLIOrionisValueError` is raised, and the trigger is not set.

        Raises
        ------
        CLIOrionisValueError
            If all parameters are zero or if any parameter is not a non-negative integer.

        Notes
        -----
        The event will be triggered at the specified interval, starting from the configured
        `start_date` (if set) and ending at `end_date` (if set). If a random delay (jitter)
        is set, it will be applied to the trigger.
