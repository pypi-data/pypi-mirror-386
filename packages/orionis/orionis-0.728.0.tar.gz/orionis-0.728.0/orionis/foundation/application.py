class Application(Container, IApplication):
    """
    Application: Main container that manages the complete lifecycle of the Orionis application.

    This class extends `Container` and acts as the central core of the Orionis framework,
    orchestrating initialization, configuration, registration, and bootstrapping of all
    application components and services. It follows a fluent interface pattern, enabling
    method chaining for clear and concise configuration.

    Key Responsibilities:
    ---------------------
    - Registers and boots both native and user-defined service providers, ensuring all
        dependencies and services are available throughout the application lifecycle.
    - Loads and manages essential framework kernels (CLI, testing, etc.), guaranteeing
        that core components are properly initialized and accessible.
    - Centralizes configuration management for all critical subsystems: authentication,
        cache, database, logging, mail, queue, routing, storage, session, testing, and more.
    - Provides methods for customizing and extending the application architecture,
        supporting dynamic configurator loading and seamless integration of additional services.
    - Implements mechanisms for custom exception handling and schedulers, enhancing
        robustness and flexibility across the application lifecycle.
    - Exposes utilities for accessing configuration and path settings using dot notation.

    Typical Workflow:
    -----------------
    1. Instantiate the Application class.
    2. Register providers and configurators via `withProviders` and `withConfigurators`.
    3. Optionally customize exception handlers and schedulers.
    4. Call `create()` to initialize and boot the application, loading kernels and providers.
    5. Access services, configuration, and paths through the Application instance.

        Configure all major application subsystems using configuration entities or dictionaries.

        This method provides a centralized interface for setting up the application's
        configuration by accepting configuration objects or dictionaries for each major
        subsystem. Each configurator parameter corresponds to a specific aspect of the
        application, such as authentication, caching, database, logging, mail, paths,
        queue, session, and testing. The method validates and loads each configurator
        into the application's configuration system.

        Parameters
        ----------
        app : App or dict, optional
            Application-level configuration (e.g., name, environment, debug settings).
            Defaults to a new App() instance.
        auth : Auth or dict, optional
            Authentication configuration (e.g., guards, providers, password settings).
            Defaults to a new Auth() instance.
        cache : Cache or dict, optional
            Caching configuration (e.g., default store, prefix, driver options).
            Defaults to a new Cache() instance.
        cors : Cors or dict, optional
            CORS configuration (e.g., allowed origins, methods, headers).
            Defaults to a new Cors() instance.
        database : Database or dict, optional
            Database configuration (e.g., connections, migration settings).
            Defaults to a new Database() instance.
        filesystems : Filesystems or dict, optional
            Filesystem configuration (e.g., disks, cloud storage).
            Defaults to a new Filesystems() instance.
        logging : Logging or dict, optional
            Logging configuration (e.g., channels, levels).
            Defaults to a new Logging() instance.
        mail : Mail or dict, optional
            Mail configuration (e.g., mailers, transport settings).
            Defaults to a new Mail() instance.
        path : Paths or dict, optional
            Application path configuration (e.g., directories for components).
            Defaults to a new Paths() instance.
        queue : Queue or dict, optional
            Queue configuration (e.g., connections, worker settings).
            Defaults to a new Queue() instance.
        session : Session or dict, optional
            Session configuration (e.g., driver, lifetime, encryption).
            Defaults to a new Session() instance.
        testing : Testing or dict, optional
            Testing configuration (e.g., database, environment variables).
            Defaults to a new Testing() instance.

        Returns
        -------
        Application
            The current Application instance, allowing for method chaining.

        Raises
        ------
        OrionisTypeError
            If any configurator parameter is not an instance of its expected type
            or a dictionary convertible to the expected type.

        Notes
        -----
        - Each configurator is validated and loaded using its corresponding load method.
        - This method does not perform deep validation of the contents of each configurator.
        - The method returns the Application instance itself for fluent chaining.

        configuration loading, service provider registration and booting, framework
        kernel initialization, and logging setup. It ensures the application is
        fully prepared for operation and prevents duplicate initialization.

        Returns
        -------
        Application
            The current application instance to enable method chaining.

        Notes
        -----
        The bootstrap process follows this sequence:
        1. Load and process all configuration from configurators
        2. Register core framework service providers
        3. Register and boot all service providers
        4. Initialize framework kernels
        5. Mark application as booted to prevent re-initialization

        This method is idempotent - calling it multiple times will not cause
        duplicate initialization. The startup time is calculated and logged
        for performance monitoring purposes.
