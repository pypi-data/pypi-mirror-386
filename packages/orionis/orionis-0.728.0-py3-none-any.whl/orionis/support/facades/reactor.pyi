class Reactor(IReactor):
    """
    Reactor facade class that implements the IReactor interface.

    This class serves as a facade for reactor functionality, providing a simplified
    interface for event-driven programming and asynchronous operations. It acts as
    a wrapper around the underlying reactor implementation, abstracting away the
    complexity of the reactor pattern and providing a clean abstraction layer.

    The Reactor class follows the facade design pattern, offering a unified and
    consistent API for managing events, callbacks, timers, and asynchronous
    operations within the Orionis framework. It encapsulates the complexity of
    event loop management and provides thread-safe access to reactor functionality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None
        This facade class typically doesn't require initialization parameters
        as it wraps an existing reactor implementation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    None
        Attributes are defined by the underlying IReactor interface implementation.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a type stub file (.pyi) used for type checking and IDE support.
    The actual implementation should be provided in the corresponding .py file.
    The reactor pattern is essential for handling I/O operations, network events,
    and other asynchronous operations in a non-blocking manner.
