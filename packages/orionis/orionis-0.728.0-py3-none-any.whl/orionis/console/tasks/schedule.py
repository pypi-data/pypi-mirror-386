        """
        Subscribe internal handlers to APScheduler events for monitoring and control.

        This method attaches internal listener methods to the AsyncIOScheduler instance for a variety of
        scheduler and job-related events. These listeners enable the scheduler to respond to lifecycle
        changes (such as start, shutdown, pause, and resume) and job execution events (such as submission,
        execution, errors, missed runs, max instance violations, and removals).

        Each listener is responsible for logging, invoking registered callbacks, and handling errors or
        missed jobs as appropriate. This setup ensures that the scheduler's state and job execution
        are monitored and managed effectively.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It registers event listeners on the scheduler instance.

        Notes
        -----
        The listeners are attached to the following APScheduler events:
            - Scheduler started
            - Scheduler shutdown
            - Job error
            - Job submitted
            - Job executed
            - Job missed
            - Job max instances exceeded
            - Job removed

        These listeners enable the scheduler to handle and react to all critical scheduling events.

        Invoke registered listeners for global scheduler events.

        This method is responsible for handling global scheduler events such as when the scheduler starts, pauses, resumes,

        invokes the listener with the provided event data and the current scheduler instance. The listener can be either a

        Retrieve the details of a specific scheduled job by its signature.

        This method searches the internal jobs list for a job whose signature matches
        the provided value. If a matching job is found, it returns a dictionary containing
        the job's details, such as its arguments, purpose, random delay, start and end dates,
        and additional details. If no job with the given signature exists, the method returns None.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signature : str
            The unique signature (ID) of the job to retrieve. Must be a non-empty string.

        Returns
        -------
        dict or None
            If a job with the specified signature is found, returns a dictionary with the following keys:
                - 'signature': str, the job's signature.
                - 'args': list, the arguments passed to the job.
                - 'purpose': str, the description or purpose of the job.
                - 'random_delay': int, the random delay associated with the job (if any).
                - 'start_date': str, the formatted start date and time of the job, or 'Not Applicable' if not set.
                - 'end_date': str, the formatted end date and time of the job, or 'Not Applicable' if not set.
                - 'details': str, additional details about the job.
            If no job with the given signature is found, returns None.

        Notes
        -----
        This method ensures that all events are loaded before searching for the job.
        The returned dictionary provides a summary of the job's configuration and metadata.

        is required, such as unrecoverable errors or forced application termination. In addition to shutting
        down the scheduler, it also signals the internal stop event to interrupt the scheduler's main loop,

        Signal the scheduler to stop synchronously by setting the internal stop event.

        This method is used to request a graceful shutdown of the scheduler from a synchronous context.
        It sets the internal asyncio stop event, which will cause the scheduler's main loop to exit.
        If an asyncio event loop is currently running, the stop event is set in a thread-safe manner
        using `call_soon_threadsafe`. If no event loop is running, the stop event is set directly.
        This method is safe to call from both asynchronous and synchronous contexts.
