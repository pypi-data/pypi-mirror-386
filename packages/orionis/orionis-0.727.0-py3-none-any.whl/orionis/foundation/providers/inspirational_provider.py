        Registers the inspirational service as a transient binding in the application container.

        This method binds the `IInspire` interface to its concrete implementation `Inspire`
        as a transient service within the application's service container. Each time the
        service is requested, a new instance of `Inspire` will be provided. The service is
        also registered with a specific alias to facilitate convenient resolution and
        identification throughout the application.

        This registration enables dependency injection, allowing other components to
        receive an instance of `Inspire` whenever the `IInspire` contract is requested.

        None
            This method does not return any value. It performs service registration as a side effect.
