class IReflectionCallable(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class defining the interface for callable reflection operations.

    This interface provides methods to introspect and manipulate callable objects,
    including functions, methods, and lambdas. It enables reflection capabilities
    such as source code retrieval, dependency analysis, and runtime execution.

        -----
        This method provides detailed information about the parameters of the callable,

        remain unresolved.

        Returns
        -------
        ResolveArguments
            An object containing information about the callable's dependencies:

                A dictionary mapping parameter names to their resolved values
                (e.g., default values or injected dependencies).

                A list of parameter names that could not be resolved
                (parameters without default values or missing annotations).

        Notes
        -----
        This method leverages the `ReflectDependencies` utility to inspect
        the callable and determine which dependencies are satisfied and
        which remain unresolved for dependency injection purposes.
