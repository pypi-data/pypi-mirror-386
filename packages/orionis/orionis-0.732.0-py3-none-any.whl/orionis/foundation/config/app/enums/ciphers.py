    """
    Enumeration of supported AES cipher modes.

    This enum defines various Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher modes and key sizes
    commonly used for encryption and decryption operations.

    Members:
        - AES_128_CBC: AES with a 128-bit key in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.
        - AES_256_CBC: AES with a 256-bit key in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.
        - AES_128_GCM: AES with a 128-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).
        - AES_256_GCM: AES with a 256-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).
