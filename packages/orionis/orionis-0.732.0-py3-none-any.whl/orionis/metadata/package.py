class PypiOrionisPackage:
    """
    Provides an interface for retrieving and accessing metadata about the Orionis package from PyPI.

    This class automatically fetches metadata from the PyPI JSON API for the Orionis package upon initialization.
    The metadata includes information such as package name, version, author, description, license, classifiers,
    required Python version, keywords, and project URLs. The metadata is stored internally and can be accessed
    through dedicated methods.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _baseUrl : str
        The base URL for the PyPI API endpoint used to fetch package metadata.
    _info : dict
        A dictionary containing the metadata retrieved from the PyPI API.

    Notes
    -----
    The metadata is retrieved using the PyPI JSON API and stored in the `_info` attribute.
    If the request fails or the response structure is invalid, an exception will be raised during initialization.
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """
        Initialize the PypiOrionisPackage instance.

        This constructor sets up the base URL for the Orionis PyPI package, initializes the internal
        information dictionary, and immediately fetches all available package metadata from PyPI.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It initializes instance attributes and populates
            the `_info` dictionary with package metadata.

        Notes
        -----
        The metadata is retrieved using the PyPI JSON API and stored in the `_info` attribute.
        If the request fails, an exception will be raised during initialization.

        self._base_url = API  # Set the base URL for the PyPI API endpoint
        self._info = {}      # Initialize the dictionary to store package metadata
        self.getAllData()    # Fetch and populate metadata from PyPI

    def getAllData(self) -> dict:
        """
        Fetch and update package metadata from the PyPI API.

        This method sends a GET request to the PyPI JSON API endpoint specified by `self._baseUrl`.
        If the request is successful (HTTP status code 200), it parses the JSON response and updates
        the internal `_info` attribute with the value associated with the "info" key. If the "info"
        key is missing or the request fails, an exception is raised.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            A dictionary containing the package metadata retrieved from PyPI. This dictionary is also
            stored in the instance's `_info` attribute.

        Raises
        ------
        Exception
            If the request to the PyPI API fails, returns a non-200 status code, or the response
            structure is invalid (missing the "info" key).

        Notes
        -----
        The method uses a timeout of 10 seconds for the HTTP request to avoid hanging indefinitely.
