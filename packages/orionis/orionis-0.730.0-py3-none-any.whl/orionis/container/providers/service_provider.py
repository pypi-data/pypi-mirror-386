    Base class for service providers in the Orionis framework.

    Service providers are responsible for registering and bootstrapping
    services and components into the application container.

    Parameters
    ----------
    app : IApplication
        The application container instance to which services will be registered.

        Initialize a new ServiceProvider instance with the given application container.

        Parameters
        ----------
        app : IApplication
            The application container instance to which this service provider will be attached.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This constructor does not return a value.

        This asynchronous method should be implemented by subclasses to bind services,

        during the application's service registration phase.

        -------

        ------
        NotImplementedError

        or perform other operations required at application boot time.
