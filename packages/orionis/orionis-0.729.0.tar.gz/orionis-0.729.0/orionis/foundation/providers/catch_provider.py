        """
        Registers the Catch service as a singleton in the application container.

        This method binds the `ICatch` interface to the `Catch` implementation as a singleton,
        using a specific alias. This ensures that only one instance of `Catch` is created and
        shared throughout the application's lifecycle. The binding allows the application to
        resolve dependencies on `ICatch` with the registered `Catch` instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It performs the registration as a side effect.
