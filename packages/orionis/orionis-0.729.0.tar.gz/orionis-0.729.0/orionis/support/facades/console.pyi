class Console(IConsole):
    """
    Console facade class that implements the IConsole interface.

    This class serves as a facade for console operations, providing a simplified
    and unified interface for console-related functionality. It inherits from the
    IConsole interface and implements all required console interface methods to
    handle various console operations.

    The Console facade provides functionality for:
    - Command line input and output operations
    - Console text formatting and styling
    - Progress indicators and status message display
    - Error and warning message handling
    - Interactive console features and user prompts

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    None
        This is a class definition that does not return a value.

    Notes
    -----
    This class acts as a facade pattern implementation, abstracting the complexity
    of underlying console operations and providing a clean, consistent API for
    console interactions throughout the application.
