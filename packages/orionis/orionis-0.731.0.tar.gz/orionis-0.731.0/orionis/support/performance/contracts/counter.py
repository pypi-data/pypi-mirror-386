class IPerformanceCounter(ABC):
    """
    A class for measuring the elapsed time between two points in code execution.

    This class provides methods to start and stop a high-resolution performance counter,
    allowing users to measure the duration of specific code segments with precision.

    @abstractmethod
    def start(self) -> 'IPerformanceCounter':
        """
        Start the performance counter.

        Records the current high-resolution time as the start time using
        `time.perf_counter()`. This marks the beginning of the interval to be measured.

        Returns
        -------
        IPerformanceCounter
            The instance of the performance counter for method chaining.

    @abstractmethod
    def stop(self) -> 'IPerformanceCounter':
        """
        Stop the performance counter and calculate the elapsed time.

        Records the current high-resolution time as the end time and computes
        the elapsed time since `start()` was called. The elapsed time is the
        difference between the end and start timestamps.

        Returns
        -------
        IPerformanceCounter
            The instance of the performance counter for method chaining.

        Get the elapsed time between the last start and stop calls.

        This method returns the elapsed time calculated during the last
        `stop()` call. If the counter has not been started and stopped,
        it raises an exception.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The elapsed time in seconds (as a float) between the last `start()` and `stop()` calls.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the counter has not been started and stopped properly.

        This method returns the elapsed time in microseconds by converting
        the value obtained from `elapsedTime()`.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The elapsed time in microseconds (as a float).

        -------

        Restart the performance counter.

        This method resets the start and end times to None and starts the counter again.
        It is useful for measuring a new interval without creating a new instance of
        PerformanceCounter.
