        Registers the CLI request services in the application container.

        This method binds the `ICLIRequest` interface to the `CLIRequest` implementation
        as a transient service within the application's dependency injection container.
        By registering this binding, any component that depends on `ICLIRequest` will
        receive a new instance of `CLIRequest` each time it is resolved. The binding is
        also associated with a specific alias for reference within the container.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It performs registration as a side effect.
