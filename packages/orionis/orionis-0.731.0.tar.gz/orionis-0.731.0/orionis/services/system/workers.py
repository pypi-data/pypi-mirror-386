        Parameters
        ----------
        ram_per_worker : float, optional
            Amount of RAM (in GB) allocated per worker. Default is 0.5.

        ----------
        _cpu_count : int
            Number of CPU cores available on the system.
        _ram_total_gb : float
            Total system RAM in gigabytes.
        _ram_per_worker : float
            RAM allocated per worker in gigabytes.

        -------
        None

        Parameters
        ----------
        ram_per_worker : float
            The new amount of RAM (in GB) to allocate for each worker.

        -------
        None
            This method does not return a value. It updates the internal RAM allocation setting.

        Notes
        -----
        Changing the RAM allocation per worker may affect the recommended number of workers
        calculated by the system. This method only updates the internal configuration and does
        not trigger any recalculation automatically.

            The maximum number of worker processes that can be safely run in parallel,
            determined by the lesser of available CPU cores and memory capacity.

        Notes
        -----
        The calculation is based on:
            - The total number of CPU cores available.
            - The total system RAM divided by the RAM allocated per worker.
        The method ensures that neither CPU nor memory resources are overcommitted.
