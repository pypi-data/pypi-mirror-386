        Initializes the internal state of the container instance.

        This constructor sets up the internal dictionaries for service bindings, aliases,
        singleton cache, and resolution cache. Initialization is performed only once per
        instance, even if `__init__` is called multiple times due to inheritance or other
        instantiation patterns. The container also registers itself under the `IContainer`
        interface for dependency injection.

        Notes
        -----
        - The `__bindings` dictionary stores service bindings by abstract type.
        - The `__aliases` dictionary maps aliases to their corresponding bindings.
        - The `__singleton_cache` dictionary caches singleton instances.
        - The `__resolution_cache` dictionary tracks types being resolved to prevent circular dependencies.
        - Initialization is guarded to ensure it only occurs once per instance.

        alias : str, optional
            An alternative name to register the service under. If not provided, a default alias is generated

        Returns
        -------

        Raises
        ------

            If the decoupling check fails or if an unexpected error occurs during registration.

        -----
        - Registers the given concrete implementation to the abstract type with a transient lifetime,
          meaning a new instance will be created each time the service is requested.
        - Validates the abstract and concrete types, checks decoupling rules, ensures all abstract methods
          are implemented, and manages service aliases.
        - If a service is already registered under the same abstract or alias, it is removed before registering
          the new binding.

            Returns True if the function was registered successfully.

        ------
        OrionisContainerTypeError

        OrionisContainerException
            If an unexpected error occurs during registration.

        - If a service is already registered under the same alias, it is removed before registering the new function.
        - The alias is validated for uniqueness and correctness.

        Removes a service registration from the container by abstract type or alias.

        their bindings and associated aliases. When a service is removed, all references to it
        are cleaned up from the container's internal dictionaries, including singleton cache

        Parameters
        ----------

        alias : str, optional

        Warnings
        --------
        Use this method with caution. Removing essential services can break dependency
        resolution chains and cause runtime failures throughout the application.

        Check if a type can be automatically resolved by the container.

        be a concrete class that belongs to a valid application namespace, is
        not a built-in Python type, and is actually instantiable.

        The validation process includes checking that the type is:
        - A proper class (not a function, module, or other callable)
        - Not a built-in Python type (str, int, list, etc.)
        - A concrete class (not abstract or interface)
        - Not a generic type or type variable
        - Part of a valid namespace defined in the container configuration

        ----------
        type_ : Callable[..., Any]

        - The method relies on the presence of the `__module__` attribute on the type.
