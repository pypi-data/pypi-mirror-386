class Workers(IWorkers):
    """
    Facade class for managing worker processes and job queues.

    This class provides a simplified interface to the underlying worker
    management system, implementing the IWorkers contract. It serves as
    a facade pattern implementation to abstract complex worker operations.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a concrete implementation of the IWorkers interface that
    delegates worker management operations to the underlying service layer.
