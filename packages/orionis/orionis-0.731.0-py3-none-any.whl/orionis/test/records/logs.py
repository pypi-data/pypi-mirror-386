            completes without raising an exception, the database is considered reset.

        Raises
        ------
        OrionisTestPersistenceError
            If an SQLite error occurs while attempting to drop the table.

        Notes
        -----
        This method is useful for clearing all test report history from the database, such as during test
        environment resets or cleanup operations.
        """

        # Attempt to drop the reports table and reset the database.
        # Returns True if successful or if the table did not exist.

        """
        Retrieve a specified number of test report records from the database.

        Parameters
        ----------
        first : int or None, optional
            The number of earliest reports to retrieve, ordered by ascending ID. Must be a positive integer.
            If specified, returns the oldest reports.
        last : int or None, optional
            The number of latest reports to retrieve, ordered by descending ID. Must be a positive integer.
            If specified, returns the most recent reports.

        Returns
        -------
        List[Tuple]
            A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row from the reports table:
            (id, json, total_tests, passed, failed, errors, skipped, total_time, success_rate, timestamp).
            If neither `first` nor `last` is provided, an empty list is returned.

        Raises
        ------
        OrionisTestValueError
            If both 'first' and 'last' are specified, or if either is not a positive integer.
        OrionisTestPersistenceError
            If there is an error retrieving reports from the database.

        Notes
        -----
        Only one of `first` or `last` can be specified at a time. The method delegates the retrieval
        logic to the internal `__getReports` method, which handles database connection management and
        query execution.
        """

        # Delegate the retrieval logic to the internal __getReports method.
        # This ensures proper validation and database access.
        return self.__getReports(first, last)
