        Prepare an Event instance for a given command signature and its arguments.

        This method validates the provided command signature and arguments, ensuring
        that the command exists among the registered commands and that the arguments
        are in the correct format. If validation passes, it creates and returns an
        Event object representing the scheduled command, including its signature,
        arguments, and description.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signature : str
            The unique signature identifying the command to be scheduled. Must be a non-empty string.
        args : Optional[List[str]], optional
            A list of string arguments to be passed to the command. Defaults to None.

            If the command signature is not a non-empty string, if the arguments are not a list
