class Directory(IDirectory):
    """
    A facade class that provides a simplified interface for directory operations.

    This class implements the IDirectory interface and serves as a facade to abstract
    directory-related functionality, providing a clean and consistent API for
    directory management operations.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a facade implementation that delegates directory operations to underlying
    services while maintaining a simple interface for client code.
