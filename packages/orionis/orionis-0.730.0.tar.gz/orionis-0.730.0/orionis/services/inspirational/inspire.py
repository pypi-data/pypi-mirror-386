        """
        Initializes the Inspire service with a list of inspirational quotes.

        This constructor sets up the internal list of quotes to be used by the service.
        If no list is provided or the provided list is empty, it defaults to using the
        predefined `INSPIRATIONAL_QUOTES`. The method also validates the structure of
        the provided quotes to ensure each entry is a dictionary containing both 'quote'
        and 'author' keys.

        Parameters
        ----------
        quotes : List[dict], optional
            A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary must contain the keys 'quote'
            (str) and 'author' (str). If not provided or empty, the default list
            `INSPIRATIONAL_QUOTES` will be used.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It initializes the internal state
            of the Inspire service.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If any item in the provided list is not a dictionary, or if a dictionary
            does not contain both 'quote' and 'author' keys.
