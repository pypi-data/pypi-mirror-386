class FileBasedSignaling:
    """
    Thread-safe file-based signaling system for inter-process communication.

    Monitors a directory for JSON command files and queues them for processing
    in the main thread. Commands are automatically removed after being read.

    Usage:
        signaling = FileBasedSignaling("my_service_id")
        signaling.start_monitoring()
        signaling.register_handler('reload', my_reload_function)

        # In your main loop:
        signaling.process_pending_commands()

        # Send commands by creating JSON files:
        echo '{"action": "reload", "params": {}}' > /tmp/cgse_signals/my_service_id_cmd.json

    Thread Safety:
        - File monitoring runs in a background daemon thread
        - Commands are queued and processed with process_pending_commands()
          which should be called from the main thread, main loop.
        - All command handlers execute in the main thread context

    Args:
        service_id: the identifier of your service that shall execute the command.
        signal_dir (str): Directory path to monitor for command files.
            Created if it doesn't exist. Defaults to "/tmp/cgse_signals"

    To trigger actions, create the files in `/tmp/cgse_signals`:

      $ echo "{'action': 'reregister'}" > /tmp/cgse_signals/cm_cs_reregister.json
