"""
This script is as an administration script for the CGSE. The script provides commands to start, stop, and
get the status of the core services and any other service that is registered as a plugin.

The following main commands have been implemented:

$ cgse version

    Prints the installed version of the cgse-core and any other package that is registered under
    the entry points group 'cgse.version'.

$ cgse core {start,stop,status}

    Starts, stops, or prints the status of the core services.

Other main commands can be added from external packages when they are provided as entry points with
the group name 'cgse.command.plugins'.

Commands can be added as single commands or as a group containing further sub-commands. To add a group,
the entry point shall contain 'group' in its extras.
