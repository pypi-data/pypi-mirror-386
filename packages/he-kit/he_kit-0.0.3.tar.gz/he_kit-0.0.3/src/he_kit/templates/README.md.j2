## Migrations

Autogenerate a new database migration based on your SQLModel definitions:

```

```

Downgrade the database to a previous revision (e.g. `-1` or a specific
revision ID):

```bash
uv run he-kit downgrade -1
```

```bash
uv run he-kit history
```

## Docker

You can build and run the included Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t helicon-app .
docker run -p 8000:8000 helicon-app
```

The default `ENTRYPOINT` of the image is `he-kit` and you can run
subcommands like `migrate`:

```bash
docker run --rm helicon-app migrate
```
