class SharedNDArray:
    """NumPy-facing wrapper over a raw :class:`multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory`.

    This class does **not** own any data itself; it wraps an OS-level shared
    memory segment and exposes it as a NumPy array via zero-copy views
    (shape/dtype provided by the caller). The underlying buffer is just a
    flat byte block; dimensionality and strides come from the views you
    construct.

    Usage model:
      - Create a segment in the parent with :meth:`create`, optionally seeding
        from an existing array (copied once, C-contiguous).
      - Pass ``(name, shape, dtype)`` to workers and attach with :meth:`attach`.
      - Obtain a view with :py:meth:`view` or the :py:attr:`array` property.
        Views are read-only by default unless ``default_readonly=False`` or
        ``view(readonly=False)`` is requested.
      - Every process that opened the segment must call :meth:`close`.
        Exactly one process should call :meth:`unlink` after all others have
        closed to destroy the OS resource.

    Indexing:
      - ``__getitem__`` strictly supports **axis-0** basic indexing
        (``None``, ``slice``, or ``int``). This guarantees **no-copy** views.
        Fancy indexing (index arrays/boolean masks) is intentionally disallowed.
      - For 1D arrays, ``int`` indexing would yield a NumPy scalar (not a view),
        so it is rejected; use ``slice(i, i+1)`` for a one-row view instead.

    Concurrency:
      - Multiple readers are safe by design.
      - If multiple writers may overlap, synchronize externally (e.g., a
        :class:`multiprocessing.Lock`). The class does not implement locking.

    Notes:
      - The writeability flag is **per-view**. Marking one view read-only does
        not prevent other processes (or other views) from writing.
      - Shape/dtype are trusted by :meth:`attach`â€”they must match what was used
        at creation time; no runtime validation is performed here.
