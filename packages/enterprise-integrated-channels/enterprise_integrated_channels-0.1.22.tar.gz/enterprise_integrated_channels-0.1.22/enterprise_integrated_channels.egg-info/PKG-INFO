Purpose
*******

An integrated channel is an abstraction meant to represent a third-party system which provides an API that can be used to transmit EdX data to the third-party system. The most common example of such a third-party system is an enterprise-level learning management system (LMS). LMS users are able to discover content made available by many different content providers and manage the learning outcomes that are produced by interaction with the content providers. In such a scenario, EdX would be the content provider while a system like SAP SuccessFactors would be the integrated channel.
