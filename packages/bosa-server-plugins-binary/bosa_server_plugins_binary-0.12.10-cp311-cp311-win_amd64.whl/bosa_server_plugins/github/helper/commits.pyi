    """Retrieve commits from specified GitHub repositories.

    Main entry point for commit search functionality. Supports searching across multiple
    repositories with filtering by date range and author. Results can be summarized
    and are cached for improved performance.

    Args:
        auth_scheme: Authentication scheme for GitHub API access.
        repositories: List of repositories to search. If None, uses all accessible repos.
        since: Start date for commit search (ISO format string).
        until: End date for commit search (ISO format string).
        author: Author of commits to search for.
        fields: List of fields to extract from commits.
        summarize: Whether to summarize results (limit to top 5 commits).
        per_page: Number of commits per page.
        page: Page number for pagination.
        cache_service: Cache service for storing results.
        callback_urls: List of callback URLs to notify when processing completes.

    Returns:
        Tuple containing:
            - Dictionary with search results including:
                - repositories: List of processed repositories
                - total_commits: Total number of commits found
                - commits: List of commit details
                - is_processing: Boolean indicating if processing is ongoing
                - author_commit_counts: Optional count of commits by author
            - List of error messages if any occurred

    Raises:
        ValueError: If cache_service is not provided or no repositories could be resolved.
