              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# rugo

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9%2B-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/rugo?period=total&units=INTERNATIONAL_SYSTEM&left_color=BRIGHTGREEN&right_color=LIGHTGREY&left_text=downloads)](https://pepy.tech/projects/rugo)

`rugo` is a C++17 and Cython powered file reader for Python. It delivers high-throughput reading for both Parquet files (metadata inspection and experimental column reader) and JSON Lines files (with schema inference, projection pushdown, and SIMD optimizations). The data-reading API is evolving rapidly and will change in upcoming releases.

## Key Features
- **Parquet**: Fast metadata extraction backed by an optimized C++17 parser and thin Python bindings.
- **Parquet**: Complete schema and row-group details, including encodings, codecs, offsets, bloom filter pointers, and custom key/value metadata.
- **Parquet**: Experimental memory-based data reading for PLAIN and RLE_DICTIONARY encoded columns with UNCOMPRESSED, SNAPPY, and ZSTD codecs.
- **JSON Lines**: High-performance columnar reader with schema inference, projection pushdown, and SIMD optimizations (19% faster).
- **JSON Lines**: Memory-based processing for zero-copy parsing.
- Works with file paths, byte strings, and contiguous memoryviews.
- Optional schema conversion helpers for [Orso](https://github.com/mabel-dev/orso).
- No runtime dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

## Installation

### PyPI
```bash
pip install rugo

# Optional extras
pip install rugo[orso]
pip install rugo[dev]
```

### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mabel-dev/rugo.git
cd rugo
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make update
make compile
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.9 or newer
- A C++17 compatible compiler (clang, gcc, or MSVC)
- Cython and setuptools for source builds (installed by the commands above)
- On x86-64 platforms, an assembler capable of compiling `.S` sources (bundled with modern GCC/Clang toolchains)
- ARM/AArch64 platforms (including Apple Silicon) are fully supported with NEON SIMD optimizations

## Quickstart
```python
import rugo.parquet as parquet_meta

metadata = parquet_meta.read_metadata("example.parquet")

print(f"Rows: {metadata['num_rows']}")
print("Schema columns:")
for column in metadata["schema_columns"]:
    print(f"  {column['name']}: {column['physical_type']} ({column['logical_type']})")

first_row_group = metadata["row_groups"][0]
for column in first_row_group["columns"]:
    print(
        f"{column['name']}: codec={column['compression_codec']}, "
        f"nulls={column['null_count']}, range=({column['min']}, {column['max']})"
    )
```
`read_metadata` returns dictionaries composed of Python primitives, ready for JSON serialisation or downstream processing.

## Returned metadata layout
```python
{
    "num_rows": int,
    "schema_columns": [
        {
            "name": str,
            "physical_type": str,
            "logical_type": str,
            "nullable": bool,
        },
        ...
    ],
    "row_groups": [
        {
            "num_rows": int,
            "total_byte_size": int,
            "columns": [
                {
                    "name": str,
                    "path_in_schema": str,
                    "physical_type": str,
                    "logical_type": str,
                    "num_values": Optional[int],
                    "total_uncompressed_size": Optional[int],
                    "total_compressed_size": Optional[int],
                    "data_page_offset": Optional[int],
                    "index_page_offset": Optional[int],
                    "dictionary_page_offset": Optional[int],
                    "min": Any,
                    "max": Any,
                    "null_count": Optional[int],
                    "distinct_count": Optional[int],
                    "bloom_offset": Optional[int],
                    "bloom_length": Optional[int],
                    "encodings": List[str],
                    "compression_codec": Optional[str],
                    "key_value_metadata": Optional[Dict[str, str]],
                },
                ...
            ],
        },
        ...
    ],
}
```
Fields that are not present in the source Parquet file are reported as `None`. Minimum and maximum values are decoded into Python types when possible; otherwise hexadecimal strings are returned.

## Parsing options
All entry points share the same keyword arguments:

- `schema_only` (default `False`): return only the top-level schema without row group details.
- `include_statistics` (default `True`): skip min/max/num_values decoding when set to `False`.
- `max_row_groups` (default `-1`): limit the number of row groups inspected; handy for very large files.

```python
metadata = parquet_meta.read_metadata(
    "large_file.parquet",
    schema_only=False,
    include_statistics=False,
    max_row_groups=2,
)
```

## Working with in-memory data
```python
with open("example.parquet", "rb") as fh:
    data = fh.read()

from_bytes = parquet_meta.read_metadata_from_bytes(data)
from_view = parquet_meta.read_metadata_from_memoryview(memoryview(data))
```
`read_metadata_from_memoryview` performs zero-copy parsing when given a contiguous buffer.

## Prototype Data Decoding (Experimental)
> **API stability:** The column-reading functions are experimental and will change without notice while we expand format coverage.

`rugo` includes a prototype decoder for reading actual column data from Parquet files. This is a **limited, experimental feature** designed for simple use cases and testing.

### Supported Features
- ✅ UNCOMPRESSED, SNAPPY, and ZSTD codecs
- ✅ PLAIN encoding
- ✅ RLE_DICTIONARY encoding
- ✅ `int32`, `int64`, `float32`, `float64`, `boolean`, and `string` (byte_array) types
- ✅ Memory-based processing (load once, decode multiple times)
- ✅ Column selection (decode only the columns you need)
- ✅ Multi-row-group support

### Unsupported Features  
- ❌ Other codecs (GZIP, LZ4, LZO, BROTLI, etc.)
- ❌ Delta encoding, PLAIN_DICTIONARY, other advanced encodings
- ❌ Nullable columns with definition levels > 0
- ❌ Other types (int96, fixed_len_byte_array, date, timestamp, complex types)
- ❌ Nested structures (lists, maps, structs)

### Primary API: Memory-Based Reading

The recommended approach loads Parquet data into memory once and performs all operations on the in-memory buffer:

```python
import rugo.parquet as rp

# Load file into memory once
with open("data.parquet", "rb") as f:
    parquet_data = f.read()

# Check if the data can be decoded
if rp.can_decode_from_memory(parquet_data):
    
    # Read ALL columns from all row groups
    table = rp.read_parquet(parquet_data)
    
    # Or read SPECIFIC columns only
    table = rp.read_parquet(parquet_data, ["name", "age", "salary"])
    
    # Access the structured data
    print(f"Columns: {table['column_names']}")
    print(f"Row groups: {len(table['row_groups'])}")
    
    # Iterate through row groups and columns
    for rg_idx, row_group in enumerate(table['row_groups']):
        print(f"Row group {rg_idx}:")
        for col_idx, column_data in enumerate(row_group):
            col_name = table['column_names'][col_idx]
            if column_data is not None:
                print(f"  {col_name}: {len(column_data)} values")
            else:
                print(f"  {col_name}: Failed to decode")
```

### Data Structure
The `read_parquet()` function returns a dictionary with this structure:
```python
{
    'success': bool,                    # True if reading succeeded
    'column_names': ['col1', 'col2'],   # List of column names
    'row_groups': [                     # List of row groups
        [col1_data, col2_data],         # Row group 0: list of columns
        [col1_data, col2_data],         # Row group 1: list of columns
        # ... more row groups
    ]
}
```
Each column's data is a Python list containing the decoded values.

### Performance Benefits

**Traditional Approach (Multiple File I/O):**
```python
# Each operation reads the file separately
metadata = rp.read_metadata("file.parquet")       # File I/O #1
col1 = rp.decode_column("file.parquet", "col1")   # File I/O #2  
col2 = rp.decode_column("file.parquet", "col2")   # File I/O #3
```

**Memory-Based Approach (Single File I/O):**
```python
# Load once, process multiple times
with open("file.parquet", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()  # File I/O #1 (only)

table = rp.read_parquet(data, ["col1", "col2"])   # In-memory processing
```

### Legacy File-Based API
For backward compatibility, file-based functions are still available:

```python
# Check if a file can be decoded
if rp.can_decode("data.parquet"):
    # Decode a specific column from first row group only
    values = rp.decode_column("data.parquet", "column_name")
    print(values)  # e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] or ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

### Use Cases
The memory-based API is optimized for:
- **Query engines** with metadata-driven pruning
- **ETL pipelines** processing multiple Parquet files
- **Data exploration** where you need to examine various columns
- **High-performance scenarios** minimizing I/O operations

See `examples/memory_based_api_example.py` and `examples/optional_columns_example.py` for complete demonstrations.

**Note:** This decoder is a **prototype** for educational and testing purposes. For production use with full Parquet support, use [PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/) or [FastParquet](https://github.com/dask/fastparquet).

## JSON Lines Reading

`rugo` includes a high-performance JSON Lines reader with schema inference, projection pushdown, and SIMD optimizations.

### Features
- ✅ Fast columnar reading with C++17 implementation and SIMD optimizations
- ✅ **19% performance improvement** from SIMD optimizations (AVX2/SSE2)
- ✅ Automatic schema inference from JSON data
- ✅ Projection pushdown (read only needed columns)
- ✅ Support for int64, double, string, and boolean types
- ✅ Native null value handling
- ✅ Memory-based processing (zero-copy parsing)
- ✅ Orso schema conversion

### Quick Example

```python
import rugo.jsonl as rj

# Sample JSON Lines data
data = b'''{"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 30, "salary": 50000.0}
{"id": 2, "name": "Bob", "age": 25, "salary": 45000.0}
{"id": 3, "name": "Charlie", "age": 35, "salary": 55000.0}'''

# Get schema
schema = rj.get_jsonl_schema(data)
print(f"Columns: {[col['name'] for col in schema]}")
# Output: Columns: ['id', 'name', 'age', 'salary']

# Read all columns
result = rj.read_jsonl(data)
print(f"Read {result['num_rows']} rows with {len(result['columns'])} columns")

# Read with projection (only specific columns)
result = rj.read_jsonl(data, columns=['name', 'salary'])
# Only reads 'name' and 'salary' - projection pushdown!
```

### Working with Files

```python
import rugo.jsonl as rj

# Load file into memory
with open("data.jsonl", "rb") as f:
    jsonl_data = f.read()

# Extract schema
schema = rj.get_jsonl_schema(jsonl_data, sample_size=1000)

# Read specific columns only
result = rj.read_jsonl(jsonl_data, columns=['user_id', 'email', 'score'])

# Access columnar data
for i in range(result['num_rows']):
    user_id = result['columns'][0][i]
    email = result['columns'][1][i]
    score = result['columns'][2][i]
    print(f"User {user_id}: {email} - Score: {score}")
```

### Orso Integration

```python
import rugo.jsonl as rj
from rugo.converters.orso import jsonl_to_orso_schema

# Get JSON Lines schema
jsonl_schema = rj.get_jsonl_schema(data)

# Convert to Orso schema
orso_schema = jsonl_to_orso_schema(jsonl_schema, schema_name="my_table")
print(f"Schema: {orso_schema.name}")
for col in orso_schema.columns:
    print(f"  {col.name}: {col.type}")
```

### Performance

The JSON Lines reader achieves approximately **109K-201K rows/second** on wide tables (50 columns), with higher throughput on narrower tables. With SIMD optimizations (AVX2/SSE2), the reader delivers:

- **Full read (50 cols)**: ~109K rows/second
- **Projection (10 cols)**: ~174-191K rows/second
- **Projection (5 cols)**: ~181-201K rows/second
- **Performance improvement**: 19% faster with SIMD optimizations

The SIMD implementation uses:
- **AVX2**: Processes 32 bytes at once for newline detection and text parsing (preferred)
- **SSE2**: Processes 16 bytes at once (fallback)
- **Scalar fallback**: Byte-by-byte processing for non-x86 architectures

#### Comparison with Opteryx

On 50-column datasets, rugo is **2.7-5.6x faster** than Opteryx 0.25.1 (release):
- **Full read**: 2.7-3.1x faster
- **Projection (10 cols)**: 3.8-5.4x faster
- **Projection (5 cols)**: 3.9-5.6x faster

**Note**: These benchmarks compare against Opteryx 0.25.1 (PyPI release) which uses a Python-based decoder with csimdjson. The main branch (0.26.0+) includes a new Cython-based fast decoder with SIMD optimizations that is expected to be significantly faster.

rugo's advantages:
- ✅ **True projection pushdown**: Only parse columns you need
- ✅ **Memory-based**: No file I/O overhead
- ✅ **Zero-copy design**: Direct memory-to-column conversion
- ✅ **Consistent performance**: Maintains throughput across dataset sizes

See `PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md` for detailed benchmark results, `JSONL_SIMD_OPTIMIZATIONS.md` for SIMD optimization details, and `OPTERYX_DECODER_ANALYSIS.md` for a technical analysis of Opteryx's Cython decoder and potential improvements.

See `examples/read_jsonl.py` and `benchmarks/compare_opteryx_performance.py` for complete demonstrations.

## Optional Orso conversion
Install the optional extra (`pip install rugo[orso]`) to enable Orso helpers:
```python
from rugo.converters.orso import extract_schema_only, rugo_to_orso_schema, jsonl_to_orso_schema

# Parquet to Orso
metadata = parquet_meta.read_metadata("example.parquet")
relation = rugo_to_orso_schema(metadata, "example_table")
schema_info = extract_schema_only(metadata)

# JSON Lines to Orso
import rugo.jsonl as rj
jsonl_schema = rj.get_jsonl_schema(data)
relation = jsonl_to_orso_schema(jsonl_schema, "jsonl_table")
```
See `examples/orso_conversion.py` and `examples/jsonl_orso_conversion.py` for complete walkthroughs.

## Development
```bash
make update     # install build and test tooling (uses uv under the hood)
make compile    # rebuild the Cython extension with -O3 and C++17 flags
make test       # run pytest-based validation (includes PyArrow comparisons)
make lint       # run ruff, isort, pycln, cython-lint
make mypy       # type checking
```
`make compile` clears previous build artefacts before rebuilding the extension in-place.

## Status and limitations
- Active development status (alpha); APIs are evolving and may change between releases.
- **Parquet**: Metadata APIs are largely stable. The column-reading API is experimental and will change.
- **JSON Lines**: High-performance reader with SIMD optimizations (19% improvement) and basic type support (int64, double, string, boolean).
- Requires a C++17 compiler when installing from source or editing the Cython bindings.
- SIMD optimizations (AVX2/SSE2) are automatically enabled on x86-64 platforms.
- Bloom filter information is exposed via offsets and lengths; higher-level helpers are planned.

## Future Format Support
rugo currently supports Parquet and JSON Lines. We are evaluating additional formats based on optimization opportunities and community demand. See [FORMAT_SUPPORT_ANALYSIS.md](docs/FORMAT_SUPPORT_ANALYSIS.md) for a detailed analysis of candidate formats (ORC, Avro, CSV, Arrow IPC) and [FORMAT_ROADMAP.md](docs/FORMAT_ROADMAP.md) for our planned roadmap.
