# {{skill_name}} - Git Workflow

## Overview

{{overview}}

This skill defines the Git workflow conventions for commit messages, branch naming, pull requests, and code reviews.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
{{#each use_cases}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
- Making commits to the repository
- Creating new branches
- Opening pull requests
- Reviewing code
- Managing releases

---

## Commit Message Format

### Standard Format

```
{{commit_format}}
```

### Structure

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

{{#if commit_types}}
{{#each commit_types}}
- **{{type}}**: {{description}}
{{/each}}
{{else}}
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect the code meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit
{{/if}}

### Scopes

{{#if commit_scopes}}
Common scopes in this project:
{{#each commit_scopes}}
- **{{scope}}**: {{description}}
{{/each}}
{{else}}
Scopes are optional and should represent the section of the codebase affected:
- **auth**: Authentication-related changes
- **api**: API changes
- **ui**: User interface changes
- **db**: Database changes
- **config**: Configuration changes
{{/if}}

### Examples

**Feature Addition**:
```
feat(auth): add Google OAuth integration

- Implement OAuth flow with Google provider
- Add OAuth callback handler
- Update user model to support OAuth providers
- Add tests for OAuth authentication

Closes #123
```

**Bug Fix**:
```
fix(api): resolve CORS issue in production

The CORS middleware wasn't properly configured for production domains.
Added production URLs to allowed origins list.

Fixes #456
```

**Documentation**:
```
docs(readme): update installation instructions

- Add Node.js version requirement
- Update environment variables section
- Add troubleshooting guide
```

**Refactoring**:
```
refactor(components): extract common Button logic

Extract shared button styles and behavior into reusable component.
No functional changes.
```

**Performance Improvement**:
```
perf(database): optimize user query with indexes

Added composite index on user.email and user.created_at
Reduced query time from 500ms to 50ms for user listings.

Benchmarks attached in #789
```

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

```
feat(api): update user endpoint response format

BREAKING CHANGE: User endpoint now returns nested profile object
instead of flat structure. Clients need to update their response parsing.

Migration guide: docs/migrations/v2-user-endpoint.md
```

### Rules

- ✅ **DO**: Keep subject line under 72 characters
- ✅ **DO**: Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- ✅ **DO**: Capitalize subject line
- ✅ **DO**: Don't end subject line with period
- ✅ **DO**: Separate subject from body with blank line
- ✅ **DO**: Wrap body at 72 characters
- ✅ **DO**: Use body to explain what and why, not how
- ✅ **DO**: Reference issues and PRs in footer
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use vague messages like "fix bug" or "update code"
- ❌ **DON'T**: Commit multiple unrelated changes together
- ❌ **DON'T**: Include sensitive information in commit messages

---

## Branch Naming

### Standard Format

```
{{branch_format}}
```

### Pattern

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

### Types

{{#if branch_types}}
{{#each branch_types}}
- **{{type}}**: {{description}}
{{/each}}
{{else}}
- **feature/**: New features
- **bugfix/**: Bug fixes
- **hotfix/**: Urgent production fixes
- **refactor/**: Code refactoring
- **docs/**: Documentation changes
- **test/**: Test additions or changes
- **chore/**: Maintenance tasks
- **release/**: Release preparation
{{/if}}

### Examples

```
feature/123-user-authentication
bugfix/456-fix-api-cors-error
hotfix/789-production-crash
refactor/321-extract-auth-logic
docs/654-update-api-documentation
test/987-add-unit-tests-auth
chore/147-update-dependencies
release/v2.0.0
```

### Rules

- ✅ **DO**: Use lowercase letters
- ✅ **DO**: Use hyphens to separate words
- ✅ **DO**: Include issue/ticket number when applicable
- ✅ **DO**: Keep description short and meaningful
- ✅ **DO**: Delete branches after merging
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use special characters or spaces
- ❌ **DON'T**: Create overly long branch names
- ❌ **DON'T**: Keep stale branches around

### Branches

- ✅ Keep branches short-lived (< 1 week)
