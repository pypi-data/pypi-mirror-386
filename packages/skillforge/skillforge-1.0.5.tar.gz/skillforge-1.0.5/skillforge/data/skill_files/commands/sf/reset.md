## What's NOT Reset

Skills themselves are never deleted by reset commands. They remain in `~/.claude/skills/` unless you manually delete them.

To remove skills:
- Manually delete from `~/.claude/skills/`
- Or selectively remove with file manager

## When to Use

- **--config**: Changed tech stack, want fresh preferences
- **--analytics**: Privacy concerns, want clean slate
- **--patterns**: Patterns seem wrong, want to re-learn
- **--cache**: Docs seem outdated, force refresh
- **--all**: Complete fresh start

## Recovery

No automatic backup is created. If you want to backup:

```bash
# Backup before reset
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/skillforge/data ~/skillforge-backup

# Restore if needed
cp -r ~/skillforge-backup/* ~/.claude/skills/skillforge/data/
```

## Related Commands
- `/sf:wizard` - Re-run setup after reset
- `/sf:status` - Check what would be reset
- `/sf:config` - Modify specific settings without reset


## Implementation

When user runs `/sf:reset`, Claude Code should execute:

```bash
skillforge reset
```

**Note**: Requires confirmation. Use --confirm to skip prompt.

**Important**: This command runs interactively in the terminal. Claude should:
1. Use the Bash tool to execute the command
2. Allow the user to interact with the command directly
3. Not interrupt or try to automate the interactive prompts
