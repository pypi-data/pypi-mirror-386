# Forecast Verifier

Forecast verifier is Python package for verifying specified causal relationships between forecasts/predictions and covariates given trained models. The package goes one step beyond simple model explainability tools to extract learnt causal relationships, and verify them against existing domain knowledge.

## Project Structure
The package is structured as follows:   
```
src/
    └── forecast_verifier/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── verifier.py
