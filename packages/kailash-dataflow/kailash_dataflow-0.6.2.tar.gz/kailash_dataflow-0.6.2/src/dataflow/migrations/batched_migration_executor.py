"""
BatchedMigrationExecutor - Performance-optimized migration execution for DataFlow.

Optimizes AutoMigrationSystem execution speed through batched DDL operations
and safe parallel execution where appropriate.

Key Features:
- Batches compatible DDL operations for efficiency
- Supports parallel execution for independent operations
- Maintains backward compatibility with AutoMigrationSystem
- Target performance: <10s for typical operations
- Respects operation dependencies and safety constraints

Alpha Release: PostgreSQL-optimized implementation.
