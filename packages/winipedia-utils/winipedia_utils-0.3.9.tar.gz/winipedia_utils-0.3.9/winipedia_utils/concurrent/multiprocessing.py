"""Multiprocessing utilities for concurrent execution.

This module provides functions for parallel processing using both multiprocessing
and multithreading approaches. It includes utilities for handling timeouts,
managing process pools, and organizing parallel execution of functions.

Returns:
    Various utility functions for concurrent processing.
