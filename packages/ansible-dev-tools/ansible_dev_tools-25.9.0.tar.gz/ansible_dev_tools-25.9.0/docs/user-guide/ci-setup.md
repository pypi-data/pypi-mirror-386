# Using the CI workflow

The following GitHub Actions are to be placed added under `.github/workflows` directory as `{filename}.yaml`
This GitHub Actions workflow automates a range of tasks integral to Ansible content development, encompassing changelog generation, linting, integration, sanity checks, and unit tests. The all_green job serves the purpose of verifying the successful completion of all preceding tasks.

Filename: `test.yaml`
