# Ansible Development Tools (ADT)

## Introduction

<!-- cspell:disable-next-line -->

Ansible Development Tools or ADT for short, aims to streamline the setup and usage of several tools needed to create [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) content.
When it comes to creating automation content using Ansible, there are several packages available that can help users in different parts of the content-creating journey. From bootstrapping new projects, all the way to ensuring content follows best practices and verifying it behaves as intended via well-established test frameworks.

## Key Features

- All-in-One Ansible Toolkit: ansible-dev-tools combines critical Ansible development packages into a unified Python package called [ansible-dev-tools](https://pypi.org/project/ansible-dev-tools/).

- Simplified Ansible Automation: ansible-dev-tools focuses on crafting your automation scenarios and workflows with speed by reducing boilerplate code without
  dealing with the intricacies of managing and integrating different Ansible libraries.

- Promote and provide [test isolation] from system and user environments.

For those looking for an IDE-based experience, we also recommend you get familiar with the [Ansible extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible).

## Included Packages

The curated list of tools installed as part of the Ansible Development Tools includes:

- [ansible-builder](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/): Ansible Builder automates the process of building execution environments using the schemas and tooling defined in various Ansible Collections and by the user.
- [ansible-core](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/ansible/): Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy and maintain. Automate everything from code deployment to network configuration to cloud management, in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.
- [ansible-creator](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/creator/): The fastest way to generate all your ansible content!
- [ansible-dev-environment](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/dev-environment/): A pip-like install for Ansible collections.
- [ansible-lint](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/): Checks playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved.
- [ansible-navigator](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/) A text-based user interface (TUI) for Ansible.
- [ansible-sign](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/sign/): Utility for signing and verifying Ansible project directory contents.
- [molecule](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/): Molecule aids in the development and testing of Ansible content: collections, playbooks and roles
- [pytest-ansible](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/pytest-ansible/): A pytest plugin that enables the use of ansible in tests, enables the use of pytest as a collection unit test runner, and exposes molecule scenarios using a pytest fixture.
- [tox-ansible](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/tox-ansible/): The tox-ansible plugin dynamically creates a full matrix of python interpreter and ansible-core version environments for running integration, sanity, and unit for an ansible collection both locally and in a Github action. tox virtual environments are leveraged for collection building, collection installation, dependency installation, and testing.
