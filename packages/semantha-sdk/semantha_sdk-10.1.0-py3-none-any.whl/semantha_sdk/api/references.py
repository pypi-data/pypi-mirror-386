If input and output is docx or pdf we return the document with comments on paragraphs.

        file (IOBase): Input document (left document).
    referencedocument (IOBase): Reference document(s) to be used instead of the documents in the domain's library.
    referencedocumentids (List[str]): To filter for document IDs. The limit here is 65000 IDs. The IDs are passed as a JSON array.
    tags (str): List of tags to filter the reference library. You can combine the tags using a comma (OR) and using a plus sign (AND).

    synonymousthreshold (float): Threshold for good matches.
    marknomatch (bool): Marks the paragraphs that have not matched
    withreferencetext (bool): Provide the reference text in the result JSON. If set to false, you have to query the library to resolve the references yourself.
    mode (ModeEnum): When using the references endpoint: Use mode to determine the type of search semantha should perform.

    documenttype (str): Specifies the document type that is to be used by semantha when reading the uploaded document.
