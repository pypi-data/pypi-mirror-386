> **‚ö†Ô∏è Attention ‚ö†Ô∏è**<br>
>This Python package, the VideoIPath Automation Tool, is still under development and currently in the beta phase. Features and interfaces may change as development progresses. Feel free to use the module and provide feedback, but be aware that breaking changes may occur in future versions.

## Introduction

The **VideoIPath Automation Tool** is a Python package designed to simplify and optimize interactions with the VideoIPath API. The focus is on providing a user-friendly and efficient way to automate configuration tasks and bulk operations on VideoIPath servers. The package abstracts the complexity of the API and provides a high-level interface. Currently, the package offers methods for managing devices  in the Inventory and Topology apps, as well as the configuration of multicast pools and profiles.

The provided methods and data models ensure easy handling, robust validation, comprehensive logging, and enhanced reliability.

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Access to a VideoIPath Server (version 2023.4.2 or higher, LTS versions recommended)
- Username and Password for a user account with API access
- Python 3.11 or higher

### Installation

The package is available via the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/videoipath-automation-tool/) and can be installed directly using `pip`.

#### Install the package using pip

```bash
pip install videoipath-automation-tool
```

**Note:** By default, the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version (currently **2024.4.20**) is used for schema validation and IntelliSense.

To switch to a specific version, see the [Driver Versioning Guide](https://github.com/SWR-MoIP/VideoIPath-Automation-Tool/blob/main/docs/driver-versioning.md)

### A Simple Example: Adding a Device to the Inventory

```python
# Import the `VideoIPathApp` class from the videoipath_automation_tool package
from videoipath_automation_tool import VideoIPathApp

# Initialize the VideoIPathApp
app = VideoIPathApp(server_address="10.1.100.10", username="api-user", password="veryStrongPassword", use_https=False, verify_ssl_cert=False)

# Create a device object with NMOS Multidevice driver
staged_device = app.inventory.create_device(driver="com.nevion.NMOS_multidevice-0.1.0")

# Set the device label, description, address, nmos port and disable 'Use indices in IDs' option
staged_device.configuration.label = "Media-Node-1"
staged_device.configuration.description = "Hello World"
staged_device.configuration.address = "10.100.100.1"
staged_device.configuration.custom_settings.port = 8080
staged_device.configuration.custom_settings.indices_in_ids = False

# Add the configured device to the inventory of the VideoIPath server
# This immediately registers the device and returns the assigned device object.
try:
    device = app.inventory.add_device(staged_device)
    print(f"Device added successfully: {device.device_id}")
    #> Device added successfully: device34
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to add device: {e}")
```
