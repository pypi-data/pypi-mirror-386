# The Fair Platform [![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

FAIR (or _The Fair Platform_) is an open-source platform that makes it easy to experiment with automatic grading systems using AI. It provides a flexible and extensible environment for building, testing, and comparing grading approaches, from interpreters and rubrics to agent-based systems and research datasets.

The goal is to support researchers, educators, and students who want to explore how AI can improve assessment, reduce manual grading workload, and enable reproducible experiments in educational technology.
## Features
<!-- TODO: When adding docs, link "customization" to a page talking about different education system data types support -->
- **Flexible Architecture** – Define courses, assignments, and grading modules with full customization.
- **Interpreters** – Parse and standardize student submissions (PDFs, images, code, etc.) into structured artifacts.
- **Graders** – Apply configurable rubrics, AI models, or hybrid approaches to evaluate submissions.
- **Artifacts** – A universal data type for storing submissions, results, and metadata.
- **Experimentation First** – Swap modules, run A/B tests, and measure performance across approaches.
- **Research-Friendly** – Designed for reproducibility, with plans for standardized datasets and benchmarks.
- **Extensible** – Build plugins for compilers, proof validators, RAG systems, or agentic graders.

## Getting Started
```bash
pip install fair-platform
fair serve
```

### Development Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- [Bun](https://bun.com/get) (for frontend development)

Once you have uv and Bun instlaled, you can build the platform and start using it:
```bash
uv run
./build.sh
fair serve
```

## Roadmap
Some planned directions for FAIR include:

- [ ] Standardized datasets for AI grading research
- [ ] Dataset generation tools (e.g., synthetic student responses with realistic errors)
- [ ] Plugins for popular LMS
- [ ] More visualization and reporting tools

## Contributing
FAIR is open for contributions! You can:

- Submit issues and feature requests.
- Propose or implement new grading modules.
- Share experimental datasets and benchmarks.

If you’re interested in collaborating, open an issue or start a discussion.
