## Changelog

### 1.0.8

- Revert change to make grpcio-tools a runtime dependency.
  - This dependency was originally moved to build deps so that it would only be installed in that environment. Unfortunately this environment is unaffected by the runtime env, so it was not constrained by the user's existing protobuf/grpc dependencies, causing the protobuf/grpc files to be generated using the latest version. If the user used an earlier version of protobuf that was not compatible with the latest, importing logic-automation would fail. By moving grpcio-tools back to a runtime dependency it can be constrained by the user's existing dependencies.

### 1.0.7

- Fix builds not building with hatchling 1.19.0.
- Add option for setting gRPC port.

### 1.0.6

- Moved `grpcio-tools` to build dependencies.

### 1.0.5

- The .whl build has been fixed, and now includes the generate protobuf/grpc files.

### 1.0.4

- YANKED!
  - The protobuf files (`saleae/grpc`) generated during the .whl build were not being included in the .whl file. This was caused by the `saleae/grpc` directory being added to the .gitignore file. These ignored files have been moved to the parent directory's .gitignore, and an empty .gitignore has been added to the python directory.
- Fix boolean analyzer settings not being sent as the correct type.

### 1.0.3

- Updated the README to link out to the docs, and move build instructions to BUILD.md.
- Updated the install docs.

### 1.0.2

- Update the distribution to only include a source distribution so that gRPC/protobuf files can be generated at install time, and be based on the installed version of grpcio/grpcio-tools/protobuf.

### 1.0.1

- YANKED!
  - This release was pulled shortly after it was released due to a conflict between the latest gRPC and the generated protobuf files.
- Change `grpc` & `grpc-tools` dependency to version `>=1.13.0`. This lowers the minimum version, and doesn't stick it to a specific version.

### 1.0.0

- First release
