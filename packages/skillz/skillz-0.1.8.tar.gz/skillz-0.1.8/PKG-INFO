# Skillz

## 👌 **Use _skills_ in any agent** _(Codex, Copilot, Cursor, etc...)_

> ⚠️ **Experimental proof‑of‑concept. Potentially unsafe. Treat skills like untrusted code and run in sandboxes/containers. Use at your own risk.**

**Skillz** is an MCP server that turns [Claude-style skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)_(`SKILL.md` plus optional resources)_ into callable tools for any MCP client. It discovers each skill, exposes the authored instructions and resources, and can run bundled helper scripts.

## Quick Start

To run the MCP server in your agent, use the following config (or equivalent):

```json
{
  "skillz": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["skillz@latest"]
  }
}
```

with the skills residing at `~/.skillz`

_or_

```json
{
  "skillz": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["skillz@latest", "/path/to/skills/direcotry"]
  }
}
```
