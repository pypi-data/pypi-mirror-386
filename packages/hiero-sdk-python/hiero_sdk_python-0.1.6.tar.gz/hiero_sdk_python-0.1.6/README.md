This is a Python SDK for interacting with the Hedera Hashgraph platform. It allows developers to:

- Manage Token Transactions like Create, Mint Fungible, Mint Non-Fungible, Associate, Dissociate, Transfer, Freeze, Unfreeze & Delete
- Manage Consensus Transactions like Topic Create, Update, Delete
- Submit Topic Messages
- Query Account Balance, Transaction Receipts, Topic Infos and Messages

## Installation

### Installing from PyPI

The latest release of this SDK is published to PyPI. You can install it with:

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install hiero-sdk-python
```

This will pull down a stable release along with the required dependencies.


### Installing from Source

You can also clone the repo and install dependencies using uv:

1. Install `uv`:

`uv` is an ultra-fast Python package and project manager. It replaces `pip`, `pip-tools`, `pipx`, `poetry`, `pyenv`,
`virtualenv`, and more.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

If on macOS, you can also install `uv` using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install uv
```

Other installation methods can be found [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python.git
cd hiero-sdk-python
```

3. Install dependencies:

One of the really nice features of `uv` is that it will download and manage the correct version of python and build
with the correct version of python based on the `.python-version`  file in the project. This means you don't have to
worry about managing multiple versions of python on your machine!

```bash
uv sync
uv run python generate_proto.py
```

**Note:** By default, `uv sync` will install the `dev` and `lint` dependency groups, which include tools like `pytest` and `ruff`. If you need to install only the project's core dependencies, use the `--no-default-groups flag`.

To update to a newer version of the protobuf libraries, edit the `generate_proto.py` file and change the version number
and then rerun it.


### Local Editable Installation

For active development, you can install the repo in editable mode. That way, changes in your local code are immediately reflected when you import:

```
git clone https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python.git
cd hiero-sdk-python
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

Now you can run example scripts like python `examples/account_create.py`, and it will import from your local hiero_sdk_python code.


## Environment Setup

Before using the SDK, you need to configure your environment variables for the operator account and other credentials.
Create a .env file in the root of your project with the following (replace with your environment variables):

```
OPERATOR_ID=0.0.1234xx
OPERATOR_KEY=af20e47d590300506032b657004220420...
NETWORK=testnet

# optional:
ADMIN_KEY=af20e47d59032b65700321009308ecfdf...
SUPPLY_KEY =302a300506032b6570032100c5e4af5..."
FREEZE_KEY=302a300306072b65700321009308ecfdf...
RECIPIENT_ID=0.0.789xx
TOKEN_ID=0.0.100xx
TOPIC_ID=0.0.200xx
FREEZE_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.100
```

The only environment variables needed are OPERATOR_ID, OPERATOR_KEY and NETWORK. The rest is optional (if customisation of the example scripts is needed).

A [sample .env](.env.example) file is provided in the root of this project. If you do not have an account on
the Hedera testnet, you can easily get one from the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com/). Learn more about
testnet [here](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/testnet).

## Running Tests

To run the test suite for the SDK, use the following command:
```
uv run pytest 
```

The test file in the root of this project will be automatically run when pushing onto a branch.
This is done by running 'Hiero Solo Action'. Read more about it here:
