Some companies attach equal importance to both social skills and academic qualifications when hiring new employees. In my opinion, education is the main prerequisite for achieving a successful career in this knowledge-intensive world.

First, higher education provides the basis for accessing top companies. It is not difficult to understand that job seekers must spend considerable amounts of time, money and energy to obtain their professional qualifications. This is why most employers value academic qualifications, as such eligibility means applicants have mastered more precise and professional knowledge. Without this competence, no chance could be acquired to enter the interview level. Second, after they are employed, expertise obtained from alma mater can make them work more efficient. For example, once a candidate from a normal college becomes a teacher, solid foundations like teaching methods and educational psychology helps him easily adapt into the workplace.

Nonetheless, I also have to insist that social skills do play a very important role to support one's career success. For example, some interior designers with great interpersonal skills can accurately figure out what their customers like in their future home, including stylistic preferences, color matching and decorations. Furthermore, such tendency can hardly be learned through attending academic institutions. In addition, team spirit is indispensable during one's career. Due to globalization, many successful cases are achieved because of cooperation. Hence, better social skills add positive opportunities and great possibilities for most individuals' success.

In conclusion, academic qualifications and social skills are essential for a bright career. However, in terms of importance, the former is more vital than the latter considering the competitiveness in the labor force.
