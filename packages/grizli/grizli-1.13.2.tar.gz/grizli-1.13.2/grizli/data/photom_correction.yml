# Inverse photometry corrections 
# 26 August 2022
#
# The values below are the median ratios of the flux densities of
# sources observed in a given detector-filter with respect to a 
# reference.  Values > 1.0 mean that the flux density derived using 
# the current calibrations is too bright relative to the reference.  
#
# The values are scalings relative to the photom calibrations for a given 
# CRDS_CTX as indicated
#
# So, to apply the corrections below, *divide* the images (SCI and ERR)
# by these values.
#
# For NIRISS (NIS), the reference values are the fluxes of standard 
# stars in CAL-
#    
# For NIRCAM SW, the values are the ratio of the NRC to NIS fluxes for stars
# in the astrometric calibration field.
#
# For NIRCAM LW, the absolute calibration in the B module comes from the
# standard.  The relative A/B calibration of F277W, F300M, and F356W comes
# from a field observed in COM-1063 where the pointing was shifted to cover 
# the same piece of sky with both modules.  The relative A/B scaling from
# 277/356 is copied to F410M and F444W.
