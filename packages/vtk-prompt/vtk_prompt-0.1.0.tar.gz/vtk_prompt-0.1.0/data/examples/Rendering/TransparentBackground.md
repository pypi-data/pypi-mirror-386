### Description

Demonstrates the use of two renderers. Notice that the second (and subsequent) renderers will have a transparent background.

You can manipulate the object in the second layer/renderer whilst the objects in the first layer/renderer form the background.

- Pressing **0** on the keyboard will let you manipulate the objects in
  layer 0.
- Pressing **1** on the keyboard will let you manipulate the objects in layer 1.

!!! info
    Also see the [LayeredActors.py](../LayeredActors) example, where we have added an extra callback so that the non-active layer objects move in conjunction with the active layer objects.
