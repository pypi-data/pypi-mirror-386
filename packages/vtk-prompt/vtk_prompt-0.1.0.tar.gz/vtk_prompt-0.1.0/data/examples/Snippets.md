### Description

Snippets are chunks of code that can be cut (*snipped*) and pasted into examples. We want each example to be stand-alone, so we do not keep the snippet code in a library.

### Available snippets

#### [CameraPosition](/Python/Snippets/CameraPosition.md)

Output the camera position while moving the image.

#### [CheckVTKVersion](/Python/Snippets/CheckVTKVersion.md)

Check the VTK version returning `True` if the requested VTK version is >= the current version.

#### [PointToGlyph](/Python/Snippets/PointToGlyph.md)

Represent points as glyphs.

#### [GetProgramParameters](/Python/Snippets/GetProgramParameters.md)

Get the program parameters.

#### [ReadPolyData](/Python/Snippets/ReadPolyData.md)

Uses the appropriate vtkPolyData reader to read any vtkPolyData file.

#### [WriteImage](/Python/Snippets/WriteImage.md)

Take a screen shot from the render window and write it to a file. The file extension selects the writer to use.
