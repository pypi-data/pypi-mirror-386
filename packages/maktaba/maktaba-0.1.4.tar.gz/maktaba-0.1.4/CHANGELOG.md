## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.4] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed
- Renamed the reranker provider from "Zerank" (the model name) to "ZeroEntropy" (the company name) throughout the codebase and documentation for consistency.

### Added
- Added support for both list and single-value filters.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed
- **Critical:** QdrantStore now correctly uses UUIDs for point IDs in all modes (in-memory, local, and server)
- Fixed error: "value book_XXX#chunk_X is not a valid point ID" when using Qdrant server mode
- Query results now return original string IDs (e.g., `book_123#chunk_0`) instead of internal UUIDs
- Migrated from deprecated `search()` to modern `query_points()` API
- **CI Build Fix:** Pinned `chromadb<1.1` to avoid dependency resolution failure with non-existent `mdurl==0.1.3`

### Added
- Comprehensive QdrantStore integration tests covering string ID handling, namespaces, and document deletion

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-10

### Added
- ZeroEntropy Zerank reranker support via `ZerankReranker` class
- New optional dependency group: `zeroentropy`
- Async reranking with graceful fallback to heuristic scoring
- Comprehensive test coverage for Zerank reranker
