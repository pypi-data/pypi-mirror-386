class ABCBaseCommand(ABCLoggingMixin, BaseCommand):
    """Abstract base class for Django management commands with logging and validation.

    This class serves as a foundation for creating Django management commands that
    require abstract method implementation enforcement and automatic logging.
    It combines Django's BaseCommand with ABCImplementationLoggingMixin to provide
    both command functionality and development-time validation.

    The class implements a template method pattern where common argument handling
    and execution flow are managed by final methods, while specific implementations
    are defined through abstract methods that subclasses must implement.

    Key Features:
        - Automatic logging of method calls with performance tracking
        - Compile-time validation that all abstract methods are implemented
        - Structured argument handling with base and custom arguments
        - Template method pattern for consistent command execution flow

    Inheritance Order:
        The order of inheritance is critical: ABCImplementationLoggingMixin must
        come before BaseCommand because Django's BaseCommand doesn't call
        super().__init__(), so the mixin's metaclass initialization must happen
        first to ensure proper class construction.

    Example:
        >>> class MyCommand(ABCBaseCommand):
        ...     def add_command_arguments(self, parser):
        ...         parser.add_argument('--my-option', help='Custom option')
        ...
        ...     def handle_command(self, *args, **options):
        ...         self.stdout.write('Executing my command')

    Note:
        - All methods are automatically logged with performance tracking
        - Subclasses must implement add_command_arguments and handle_command
        - The @final decorator prevents overriding of template methods

        This method implements the template method pattern by first adding common
        base arguments that are used across multiple commands, then delegating
        to the abstract add_command_arguments method for command-specific arguments.

        The @final decorator prevents subclasses from overriding this method,
        ensuring consistent argument handling across all commands while still
        allowing customization through the abstract method.
