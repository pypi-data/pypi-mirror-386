.. code-block:: shell

Shows all available commands with their helper description and arguments.


Usage pattern
-------------

.. code-block:: shell

   flowcept --<function-name-with-dashes> [--<arg-name-with-dashes>=<value>] ...

Rules:
- Commands come from :mod:`flowcept.cli` public functions.
- Underscores become hyphens (e.g., ``stream_messages`` â†’ ``--stream-messages``).
- Bool params work as flags (present/absent). Other params require a value.
