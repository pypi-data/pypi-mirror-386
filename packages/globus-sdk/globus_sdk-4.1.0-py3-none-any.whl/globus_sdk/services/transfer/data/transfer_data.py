    r"""
    Convenience class for constructing a transfer document, to use as the
    ``data`` parameter to
    :meth:`submit_transfer <globus_sdk.TransferClient.submit_transfer>`.

    At least one item must be added using
    :meth:`add_item <globus_sdk.TransferData.add_item>`.

    :param source_endpoint: The endpoint ID of the source endpoint
    :param destination_endpoint: The endpoint ID of the destination endpoint
    :param label: A string label for the Task
    :param submission_id: A submission ID value fetched via :meth:`get_submission_id \
        <globus_sdk.TransferClient.get_submission_id>`. By default, the SDK
        will fetch and populate this field when :meth:`submit_transfer \
        <globus_sdk.TransferClient.submit_transfer>` is called.
    :param sync_level: The method used to compare items between the source and
        destination. One of  ``"exists"``, ``"size"``, ``"mtime"``, or ``"checksum"``
        See the section below on sync-level for an explanation of values.
    :param verify_checksum: When true, after transfer verify that the source and
        destination file checksums match. If they don't, re-transfer the entire file and
        keep trying until it succeeds. This will create CPU load on both the origin and
        destination of the transfer, and may even be a bottleneck if the network speed
        is high enough.
        [default: ``False``]
    :param preserve_timestamp: When true, Globus Transfer will attempt to set file
        timestamps on the destination to match those on the origin. [default: ``False``]
    :param encrypt_data: When true, all files will be TLS-protected during transfer.
        [default: ``False``]
    :param deadline: An ISO-8601 timestamp (as a string) or a datetime object which
        defines a deadline for the transfer. At the deadline, even if the data transfer
        is not complete, the job will be canceled. We recommend ensuring that the
        timestamp is in UTC to avoid confusion and ambiguity. Examples of ISO-8601
        timestamps include ``2017-10-12 09:30Z``, ``2017-10-12 12:33:54+00:00``, and
        ``2017-10-12``
    :param skip_source_errors: When true, source permission denied and file
        not found errors from the source endpoint will cause the offending
        path to be skipped.
        [default: ``False``]
    :param fail_on_quota_errors: When true, quota exceeded errors will cause the
        task to fail.
        [default: ``False``]
    :param delete_destination_extra: Delete files and directories on the
        destination endpoint which don’t exist on the source endpoint or are a
        different type. Only applies for recursive directory transfers.
        [default: ``False``]
    :param notify_on_succeeded: Send a notification email when the transfer completes
        with a status of SUCCEEDED.
        [default: ``True``]
    :param notify_on_failed: Send a notification email when the transfer completes
        with a status of FAILED.
        [default: ``True``]
    :param notify_on_inactive: Send a notification email when the transfer changes
        status to INACTIVE. e.g. From credentials expiring.
        [default: ``True``]
    :param source_local_user: Optional value passed to the source's identity mapping
        specifying which local user account to map to. Only usable with Globus Connect
        Server v5 mapped collections.
    :param destination_local_user: Optional value passed to the destination's identity
        mapping specifying which local user account to map to. Only usable with Globus
        Connect Server v5 mapped collections.
    :param additional_fields: additional fields to be added to the transfer
        document. Mostly intended for internal use

    **Sync Levels**

    The values for ``sync_level`` are used to determine how comparisons are made between
    files found both on the source and the destination. When files match, no data
    transfer will occur.

    For compatibility, this can be an integer ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, or ``3`` in addition
    to the string values.

    The meanings are as follows:

    =====================   ========
    value                   behavior
    =====================   ========
    ``0``, ``exists``       Determine whether or not to transfer based on file
                            existence. If the destination file is absent, do the
                            transfer.
    ``1``, ``size``         Determine whether or not to transfer based on the size of
                            the file. If destination file size does not match the
                            source, do the transfer.
    ``2``, ``mtime``        Determine whether or not to transfer based on modification
                            times. If source has a newer modified time than the
                            destination, do the transfer.
    ``3``, ``checksum``     Determine whether or not to transfer based on checksums of
                            file contents. If source and destination contents differ, as
                            determined by a checksum of their contents, do the transfer.
    =====================   ========

        Add a filter rule to the transfer document.

        These rules specify which items are or are not included when recursively
        transferring directories. Each item that is found during recursive directory
        traversal is matched against these rules in the order they are listed.
        The method of the first filter rule that matches an item is applied (either
        "include" or "exclude"), and filter rule matching stops. If no rules match,
        the item is included in the transfer. Notably, this makes "include" filter
        rules only useful when overriding more general "exclude" filter rules later
        in the list.

        :param name: A pattern to match against item names. Wildcards are supported, as
            are character groups: ``*`` matches everything, ``?`` matches any single
            character, ``[]`` matches any single character within the brackets, and
            ``[!]`` matches any single character not within the brackets.
        :param method: The method to use for filtering. If "exclude" (the default)
            items matching this rule will not be included in the transfer. If
            "include" items matching this rule will be included in the transfer.
        :param type: The types of items on which to apply this filter rule. Either
            ``"file"`` or ``"dir"``. If unspecified, the rule applies to both.
            Note that if a ``"dir"`` is excluded then all items within it will
            also be excluded regardless if they would have matched any include rules.

        Example Usage:

        >>> tdata = TransferData(...)
        >>> tdata.add_filter_rule(method="exclude", "*.tgz", type="file")
        >>> tdata.add_filter_rule(method="exclude", "*.tar.gz", type="file")

        ``tdata`` now describes a transfer which will skip any gzipped tar files with
        the extensions ``.tgz`` or ``.tar.gz``

        >>> tdata = TransferData(...)
        >>> tdata.add_filter_rule(method="include", "*.txt", type="file")
        >>> tdata.add_filter_rule(method="exclude", "*", type="file")

        ``tdata`` now describes a transfer which will only transfer files
        with the ``.txt`` extension.
