# 🌀 bluer-objects

🌀 `bluer-objects` are the inputs and outputs of [AI algo](https://github.com/kamangir/giza). They are maintained in cloud storage (supports [WebDav](https://pypi.org/project/webdavclient3/)) and their metadata is tracked by [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/). Examples are the Sentinel-2 [datacube](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-geo/tree/main/blue_geo/datacube) `datacube-EarthSearch-sentinel_2_l1c-S2A_10UDC_20240731_0_L1C` and 🌐 [`@geo watch` outputs](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-geo/tree/main/blue_geo/watch).
