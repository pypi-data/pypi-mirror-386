Character Description:
Max Tenner is a high-school junior whose youthful energy is visible in his sparkly blue eyes and playful smile. His jet-black hair is usually tousled and falls neatly on his forehead giving him an edgy, youthful appearance. He's of average height with a slim build which he often conceals under his baggy clothes.

With an inherent curiosity, Max is a quick learner and has a particular interest in technology and music. He's sensitive and caring towards the feelings of others, but is fiercely independent and unafraid to pave his own path or stand up for what he believes in.

Background:
Max Tenner was born and raised in a middle-class family from suburban New England. His parents, Kim and Robert Tenner are hard-working individuals who have instilled in him a strong work ethic and deep respect for education. The value of determination and perseverance was further emblazoned onto him by close family member, his uncle Erik James, a successful sales leader and marathon runner.

Interactions with Other People:
Max is cordially respected by his peers and teachers. He's helpful and empathetic, making others feel at ease. Whether it's in the classroom or on the football field, he encourages camaraderie. Additionally, Max speaks eloquently, and his conversations often carry undercurrents of his diverse reading habits and intellectual curiosity.

His best friend is Archie, a towering figure on the football team with a great sense of humour, notorious for his infectious laughter and love for video games. Max mediates disputes in his dynamic social circles, often bringing his family and friends together for a game night.

Past Job and Education History:
As a teenager, Max is still working on obtaining his high school diploma. While he has no formal job history, he spends free time volunteering at local community centres and coaching a junior football team. Max has consistently performed well in academics, excelling particularly in science and literature-oriented subjects.

This careful balance of intellect and physical prowess, a sense of duty and responsibility, and an endearing yet focused persona make Max Tenner stand out.
