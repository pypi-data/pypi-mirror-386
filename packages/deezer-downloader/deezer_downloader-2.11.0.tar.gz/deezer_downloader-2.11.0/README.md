## Get started

### 1. Install Python
[python.org](https://www.python.org/about/)

### 2. Install deezer-downloader
```bash
pip install --user deezer-downloader
```

If you want to use the Docker image, [scroll](#run-with-docker) down a bit.

### 3. Retrieve your `arl` cookie

On Firefox or Chrome-based browser:
- Log into your Deezer account
- Open the DevTools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+C` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`)
- Go to `Storage` tab
- In the cookies, find `arl`: a ~200 characters alphanumeric key

### 4. Set the config file
Retrieve the template: 
```bash 
deezer-downloader --show-config-template > config.ini
```
You need to set at least:
- under `[deezer]`: `cookie_arl`, your arl cookie
- under `[youtubedl]`: `command`, your yt-dlp install path\
As stated in the config template, deezer-downloader do NOT keep yt-dlp updated, you will have to monitor this yourself.

Check [Settings](#settings) for further instructions.

### 5. Run deezer-downloader
```bash
deezer-downloader --config config.ini
```

### 6. Access the frontend
Unless specified differently in the config file, the default frontend address is: http://localhost:5000.
Access it with your favourite web browser.

Check [Screenshots](#screenshots) if needed.

Enjoy! ðŸ¦„

## Settings

There is a settings file template called `settings.ini.example`. You can specify the download directory with  `download_dir`. Pressing the download button only downloads the song/album/playlist. If you set `use_mpd=True` in the `settings.ini` the backend will connect to mpd (localhost:6600) and update the music database. Pressing the play button will download the music. If `use_mpd=True`  is set the mpd database will be updated and the song/album/playlist will be added to the playlist. In `settings.ini` `music_dir` should be the music root location of mpd. The `download_dir` must be a subdirectory of `music_dir`. 

As Deezer sometimes requires a captcha to login the auto login features was removed. Instead you have to manually insert a valid Deezer cookie to the `settings.ini`. The relevant cookie is the `arl` cookie.

```bash
kmille@linbox:deezer-downloader poetry run deezer-downloader --help
usage: deezer-downloader [-h] [-v] [-t] [-c CONFIG]

Download music from Deezer with a nice front end

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show version and exit
  -t, --show-config-template
                        show config template. At least you have to insert the ARL cookie
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        config file - if not supplied, the following directories are considered looking for deezer-downloader.ini: current working directory, XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable, ~/.config, /etc)

kmille@linbox:deezer-downloader poetry run deezer-downloader --config settings.ini

## Specific use cases

### Run with Docker

There is a Docker image hosted on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/kmille2/deezer-downloader). Please use an ARL cookie of your Deezer account.

```bash
mkdir downloads
sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 --volume $(pwd)/downloads/:/mnt/deezer-downloader --env DEEZER_COOKIE_ARL=your_ARL_cookie kmille2/deezer-downloader:latest 
xdg-open http://localhost:5000
```

### Run with Vagrant

```bash	
cd deployment
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
sudo vim /opt/deezer/settings.ini # insert your Deezer cookie
cd /opt/deezer && sudo poetry run deezer-downloader --config settings.ini

# On the host:
xdg-open http://localhost:5000 # view frontend in the browser
ncmpcpp -h 127.0.0.1 # try the mpd client
```

### Run as systemd service

We use it with nginx and [ympd](https://github.com/notandy/ympd) as mpd frontend:
- / goes to ympd
- /d/ goes to the downloader

The deployment directory contains a systemd unit file and a nginx vhost config file. There is also a [patch](https://github.com/kmille/music-ansible/blob/master/roles/ympd/files/fix_header.patch) to add a link to the ympd frontend. The `debug` tab will show you the debug output of the app.Shortcuts

If you want to debug or build it from source: there is a docker-compose file in the docker directory. The `docker/downloads` directory is mounted into the container and will be used as download directory. You have to check the permissions of the `docker/downloads` directory as docker mounts it with the same owner/group/permissions as on the host. The `deezer` user in the docker container has uid 1000. If you also have the uid 1000 then there should be no problem. For debugging: `sudo docker-compose build --force-rm && sudo docker-compose up`

### Developer setup
Tested on Ubuntu Jammy:

```bash
  sudo apt-get update -q
  sudo apt-get install -qy vim tmux git ffmpeg

  # python3-poetry is too old (does not support groups ...)
  sudo apt-get install -qy python3-pip
  sudo pip install poetry
  git clone https://github.com/kmille/deezer-downloader.git
  cd deezer-downloader
  poetry install
  poetry run deezer-downloader --show-config-template > settings.ini

  # enable yt-dlp
  sudo pip install yt-dlp
  sed -i 's,.*command = /usr/bin/yt-dlp.*,command = /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp,' settings.ini

  # enable mpd
  sudo apt-get install -yq mpd ncmpcpp
  sudo sed -i 's,^music_directory.*,music_directory         "/tmp/deezer-downloader",' /etc/mpd.conf
  sudo systemctl restart mpd
  sed -i 's/.*use_mpd = False.*/use_mpd = True/' settings.ini

  # 1) Adjust the Deezer cookie: vim settings.ini
  # 2) Run tests: DEEZER_DOWNLOADER_CONFIG_FILE=settings.ini poetry run pytest -v -s
  # 3) Run it: poetry run deezer-downloader --config settings.ini
  # 4) Try out: ncmpcpp -h 127.0.0.1 && xdg-open http://localhost:5000
  # 5) Downloaded files are in /tmp/deezer-downloader
```

## Tests

```bash
cd deezer-downloader
DEEZER_DOWNLOADER_CONFIG_FILE=settings.ini poetry run pytest -v -s
# If you don't set DEEZER_DOWNLOADER_CONFIG_FILE the default template file will be used. Some tests will fail because there is no valid arl_cookie.
```
