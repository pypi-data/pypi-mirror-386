I've spent nearly two decades

00:14.979 --> 00:18.532
observing what makes people luckier than others

00:18.556 --> 00:22.119
and trying to help people increase their luck.

00:22.675 --> 00:25.567
You see, I teach entrepreneurship,

00:25.591 --> 00:29.140
and we all know that most new ventures fail,

00:29.164 --> 00:32.797
and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.

00:33.846 --> 00:35.136
So what is luck?

00:35.160 --> 00:41.200
Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.

00:42.295 --> 00:43.662
Apparently.

00:43.686 --> 00:45.321
That's the operative word.

00:46.353 --> 00:48.362
It looks like it's chance

00:48.386 --> 00:53.544
because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.

00:53.568 --> 00:56.561
But I've realized, by watching so long,

00:56.585 --> 00:59.918
that luck is rarely a lightning strike,

00:59.942 --> 01:01.696
isolated and dramatic.
