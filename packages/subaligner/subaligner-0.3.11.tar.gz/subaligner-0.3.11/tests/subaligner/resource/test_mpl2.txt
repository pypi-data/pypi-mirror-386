[124][149] I've spent nearly two decades
[149][185] observing what makes people luckier than others
[185][221] and trying to help people increase their luck.
[226][255] You see, I teach entrepreneurship,
[255][291] and we all know that most new ventures fail,
[291][327] and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.
[338][351] So what is luck?
[351][412] Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.
[422][436] Apparently.
[436][453] That's the operative word.
[463][483] It looks like it's chance
[483][535] because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.
[535][565] But I've realized, by watching so long,
[565][599] that luck is rarely a lightning strike,
[599][616] isolated and dramatic.
