00:00:12:I've spent nearly two decades
00:00:14:observing what makes people luckier than others
00:00:18:and trying to help people increase their luck.
00:00:22:You see, I teach entrepreneurship,
00:00:25:and we all know that most new ventures fail,
00:00:29:and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.
00:00:33:So what is luck?
00:00:35:Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.
00:00:42:Apparently.
00:00:43:That's the operative word.
00:00:46:It looks like it's chance
00:00:48:because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.
00:00:53:But I've realized, by watching so long,
00:00:56:that luck is rarely a lightning strike,
00:00:59:isolated and dramatic.
