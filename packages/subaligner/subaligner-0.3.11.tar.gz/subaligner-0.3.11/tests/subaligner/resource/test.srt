1
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,955
I've spent nearly two decades

2
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:18,532
observing what makes people luckier than others

3
00:00:18,556 --> 00:00:22,119
and trying to help people increase their luck.

4
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:25,567
You see, I teach entrepreneurship,

5
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:29,140
and we all know that most new ventures fail,

6
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:32,797
and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.

7
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:35,136
So what is luck?

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,200
Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.

9
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:43,662
Apparently.

10
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:45,321
That's the operative word.

11
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:48,362
It looks like it's chance

12
00:00:48,386 --> 00:00:53,544
because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.

13
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:56,561
But I've realized, by watching so long,

14
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:59,918
that luck is rarely a lightning strike,

15
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:01,696
isolated and dramatic.
