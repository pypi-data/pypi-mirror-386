I've spent nearly two decades

0:00:14.979,0:00:18.532
observing what makes people luckier than others

0:00:18.556,0:00:22.119
and trying to help people increase their luck.

0:00:22.675,0:00:25.567
You see, I teach entrepreneurship,

0:00:25.591,0:00:29.140
and we all know that most new ventures fail,

0:00:29.164,0:00:32.797
and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.

0:00:33.846,0:00:35.136
So what is luck?

0:00:35.160,0:00:41.200
Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.

0:00:42.295,0:00:43.662
Apparently.

0:00:43.686,0:00:45.321
That's the operative word.

0:00:46.353,0:00:48.362
It looks like it's chance

0:00:48.386,0:00:53.544
because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.

0:00:53.568,0:00:56.561
But I've realized, by watching so long,

0:00:56.585,0:00:59.918
that luck is rarely a lightning strike,

0:00:59.942,0:01:01.696
isolated and dramatic.
