# NIM containers use default entrypoint - no custom command needed
# Configuration is done via environment variables in lepton_config

endpoints:
  chat: /v1/chat/completions
  completions: /v1/completions
  health: /health
# Note: Environment variables should be configured in lepton_config.envs
# Auto-derived environment variables from deployment config:
# - SERVED_MODEL_NAME (from served_model_name)
# - NIM_MODEL_NAME (from served_model_name for NIM)
# - MODEL_PORT (from port)
