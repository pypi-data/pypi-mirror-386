# LangChain Notion Tools

LangChain Notion Tools brings first-class read and write capabilities for Notion into LangChain
agents and workflows. The package provides:

- `NotionSearchTool` â€“ locate databases and pages with normalized results ready for LLMs.
- `NotionWriteTool` â€“ create or update pages with rich block payloads, property updates, and
  dry-run previews.
- `NotionToolkit` â€“ convenience factory bundling both tools with shared retry-aware clients.
- Block helper utilities, Markdown-to-Notion conversion, and a lightweight CLI for rapid
  debugging.

## Why this package

- **Agent native** â€“ tools implement the LangChain tool protocol with sync and async runtimes.
- **Secure by design** â€“ block allowlists, size limits, and safe token redaction are enabled by
  default.
- **LLM-friendly shape** â€“ inputs and outputs are powered by Pydantic models with JSON schema
  tuned for structured prompting.
- **Ergonomic** â€“ ship a CLI, docs, and runnable examples so you can iterate quickly.

> ðŸ’¡ **Compatibility:** Requires Python 3.9+, `langchain-core>=0.3`, and the official
> [`notion-client`](https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py) SDK.
