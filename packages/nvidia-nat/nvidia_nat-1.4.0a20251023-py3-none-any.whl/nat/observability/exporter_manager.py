class ExporterManager:
    """
    Manages the lifecycle of asynchronous exporters.

    ExporterManager maintains a registry of exporters, allowing for dynamic addition and removal. It provides
    methods to start and stop all registered exporters concurrently, ensuring proper synchronization and
    lifecycle management. The manager is designed to prevent race conditions during exporter operations and to
    handle exporter tasks in an asyncio event loop.

    Each workflow execution gets its own ExporterManager instance to manage the lifecycle of exporters
    during that workflow's execution.

    Exporters added after `start()` is called will not be started automatically. They will only be
    started on the next lifecycle (i.e., after a stop and subsequent start).

        shutdown_timeout (int, optional): Maximum time in seconds to wait for exporters to shut down gracefully.
