"""
MCP Prompts Package.

This package provides classes for defining and managing prompts in the
Model Control Protocol (MCP) system. Prompts represent structured templates
that can be filled with arguments and used for generating text with language models.

The package includes:
- Prompt: Class for defining named prompts with descriptions and arguments
- PromptArgument: Class for defining the expected arguments for a prompt

These structures enable standardized prompt creation and parameter validation
across different MCP implementations.
