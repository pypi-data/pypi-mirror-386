"""
Prompt management and provisioning system for the Agentle framework.

This package provides utilities for working with prompts, including:
- Prompt models for representing prompt content
- Provider interfaces and implementations for retrieving prompts from various sources
- Utilities for prompt templating and variable substitution

The design follows a modular approach that separates prompt representation from
prompt provisioning, allowing for flexible integration with different prompt
storage and management solutions.
