MCP Messaging Package.

This package provides classes for representing different types of messages
in the Model Control Protocol (MCP) system. It defines structures for various
message types that can be exchanged between assistants and users, including:

- AssistantMessage: Messages generated by an assistant
- TextMessageContent: Text-based message content
- ImageMessageContent: Image-based message content

These message structures are used for constructing conversations and
handling different content types in the MCP ecosystem.
