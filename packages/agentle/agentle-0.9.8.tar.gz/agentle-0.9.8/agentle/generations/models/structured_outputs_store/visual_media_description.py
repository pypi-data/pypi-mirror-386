Imagine you are explaining it to someone who cannot see or hear it. Describe the overall purpose or what information it is conveying. Detail the main components and how they are organized, considering both spatial and temporal aspects. Use precise language to describe visual characteristics like shapes, colors, patterns, and relationships, as well as temporal characteristics like duration, transitions, and pacing. For abstract media, focus on describing the properties and composition. Think about the key aspects someone needs to understand to grasp the content and structure. Examples: 'The video presents a step-by-step tutorial on assembling a device. Text overlays accompany the visual demonstrations.', 'The animated graphic shows the flow of data through a network, with arrows indicating direction and color-coding representing different types of data.', 'The abstract animation features pulsating colors and evolving geometric shapes set to a rhythmic soundtrack.'",
