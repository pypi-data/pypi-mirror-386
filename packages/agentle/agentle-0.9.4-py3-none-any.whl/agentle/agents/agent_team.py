"""
Agent Team Module for the Agentle Framework

This module provides functionality for creating dynamic teams of AI agents managed by an orchestrator.
AgentTeam implements a flexible approach to multi-agent systems where agents are selected at runtime
based on the specific requirements of each task and subtask.

Unlike the AgentPipeline which follows a fixed sequence of agents, AgentTeam uses an orchestrator
agent to dynamically analyze tasks and select the most appropriate agent to handle each step.
This provides greater flexibility and adaptability, particularly for complex workflows where:

1. The optimal sequence of agents depends on the specific task
2. Different agents may be needed depending on the content of previous responses
3. The same agent may need to be invoked multiple times for different aspects of a task
4. The task completion criteria can only be determined at runtime

Example:
```python
from agentle.agents.agent import Agent
from agentle.agents.agent_team import AgentTeam
from agentle.agents.agent_config import AgentConfig
from agentle.generations.providers.google.google_generation_provider import GoogleGenerationProvider

# Create provider for all agents
provider = GoogleGenerationProvider()

# Create specialized agents
research_agent = Agent(
    name="Research Agent",
    description="Specialized in finding information and data on various topics",
    generation_provider=provider,
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instructions="You are a research agent focused on gathering accurate information.",
)

coding_agent = Agent(
    name="Coding Agent",
    description="Specialized in writing and debugging code in various languages",
    generation_provider=provider,
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instructions="You are a coding expert that writes clean, efficient code.",
)

writing_agent = Agent(
    name="Writing Agent",
    description="Specialized in creating clear and engaging written content",
    generation_provider=provider,
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instructions="You are a writing expert that creates compelling content.",
)

# Create a team with these agents and an orchestrator

    agents=[research_agent, coding_agent, writing_agent],

    orchestrator_model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    team_config=AgentConfig(maxIterations=10)
)

# Run the team with a task
result = team.run("Research the latest advancements in quantum computing and summarize them.")

    """
    A dynamic team of AI agents managed by an orchestrator agent.

    AgentTeam implements an approach to multi-agent systems where agents are selected
    dynamically at runtime by an orchestrator. The orchestrator analyzes each task or
    subtask and determines which specialized agent is best suited to handle it.

    This provides greater flexibility than sequential pipelines, as the exact sequence
    of agent invocations can be determined based on the specifics of the task and the
    content of intermediate responses.

    Key features:
    - Dynamic agent selection: The orchestrator chooses the most appropriate agent for each step
    - Adaptable workflows: The sequence of agents is determined at runtime based on the task
    - Conversation history: Context is maintained throughout the task execution
    - Configurable execution limits: Prevents infinite loops with clear termination criteria

    Attributes:
        agents: A sequence of specialized Agent instances available to the team.
        orchestrator_provider: The generation provider used by the orchestrator agent.
        orchestrator_model: The model to be used by the orchestrator agent.
        team_config: Configuration options for the team, including iteration limits.
