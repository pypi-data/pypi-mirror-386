"""
Base Message module for MCP.

This module is intended to define base message types and common functionality
for the Model Control Protocol (MCP) messaging system. In the current implementation,
specific message types are defined in their own modules (assistant_message.py,
user_message.py, etc.).

This module can be extended in the future to provide shared base classes or
utilities for message handling across different message types.
