Main Features:
- Database migration from Access to SQLite
- DPM-XL syntax validation and parsing
- DPM-XL semantic analysis

Quick Start:
    >>> import pydpm
    >>>
    >>> # Migration
    >>> migration = pydpm.api.MigrationAPI()
    >>> engine = migration.migrate_access_to_sqlite("data.mdb", "output.db")
    >>>
    >>> # Syntax validation
    >>> syntax = pydpm.api.SyntaxAPI()
    >>> result = syntax.validate_expression("{tC_01.00, r0100, c0010}")
    >>>
    >>> # Semantic analysis
    >>> semantic = pydpm.api.SemanticAPI()
    >>> result = semantic.validate_expression("{tC_01.00, r0100, c0010}")
