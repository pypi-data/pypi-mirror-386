    """Abstract base class for Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) solvers.

    All solver implementations should inherit from this class and implement
    the solve_single and batch_solve methods.

    The LAP seeks to find an optimal assignment between two sets given a cost matrix,
    minimizing (or maximizing) the total cost of the assignment.
