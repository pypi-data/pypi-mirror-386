An extremely fast Python type checker and language server, written in Rust.

> WARNING:
>
> ty is in preview and is not ready for production use.
>
> We're working hard to make ty stable and feature-complete, but until then, expect to encounter bugs,
> missing features, and fatal errors.

## Getting started

Try out the [online playground](https://play.ty.dev), or run ty with
[uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools) to get started quickly:

```shell
uvx ty
```

For other ways to install ty, see the [installation](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/installation/) documentation.

If you do not provide a subcommand, ty will list available commands â€” for detailed information about
command-line options, see the [CLI reference](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/cli/).

Use the `check` command to run the type checker:

```shell
uvx ty check
```

ty will run on all Python files in the working directory and or subdirectories. If used from a
project, ty will run on all Python files in the project (starting in the directory with the
`pyproject.toml`)

You can also provide specific paths to check:

```shell
uvx ty check example.py
```

When type checking, ty will find installed packages in the active virtual environment (via
`VIRTUAL_ENV`) or discover a virtual environment named `.venv` in the project root or working
directory. It will not find packages in non-virtual environments without specifying the target path
with `--python`. See the [module discovery](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/modules/) documentation for
details.
