## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **str** | Unique identifier | [optional] [readonly] 
**org_id** | **str** | The unique id of the Organisation to which this user belongs.  | [optional] 
**first_name** | **str** | User&#39;s first name | [optional]

**email** | [**Email**](Email.md) |  | [optional] 
**display_name** | **str** | A suitable, simplified name of the user that can be used to identify a user. For users of type \&quot;user\&quot;, this would be the users email. For other user types (group), the first_name would be used as the display_name. This does introduce the possiblity that multiple users may have identical display names. In this situation, it would be up to the consumer of this to de-duplicate the users (such as also display the users email alongside).  examples:     display_name: user@example.com     display_name: all_users_group  | [optional] [readonly]
