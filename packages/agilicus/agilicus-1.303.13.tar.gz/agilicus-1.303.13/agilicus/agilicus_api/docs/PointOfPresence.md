# PointOfPresence

A PointOfPresence represents a logical location providing functionality to customers. Each point of presence resides in a fairly small geographical area. Some point of presences support more functionality than others, which is reflected in their capabilities. A point of presence's name is globally unique, and will never change. All point of presences are tagged with their name.
