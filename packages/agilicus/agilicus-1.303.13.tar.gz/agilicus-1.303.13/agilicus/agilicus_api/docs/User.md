# User


## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**member_of** | [**[UserIdentity]**](UserIdentity.md) | List of groups that the user is a member of | [optional] 
**id** | **str** | Unique identifier | [optional] [readonly] 
**external_id** | **str, none_type** | External unique identifier | [optional] 
**enabled** | **bool** | Indicates if the user is enabled or disabled. This field is managed by the backend based on the users configured status, along with the disabled_at_time property if that is set.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**status** | [**UserStatusEnum**](UserStatusEnum.md) |  | [optional] 
**first_name** | **str** | User&#39;s first name | [optional] 
**last_name** | **str** | User&#39;s last name | [optional] 
**full_name** | **str** | User&#39;s full name, combination of first and last name | [optional] 
**email** | [**Email**](Email.md) |  | [optional] 
**display_name** | **str** | A suitable, simplified name of the user that can be used to identify a user. For users of type \&quot;user\&quot;, this would be the users email. For other user types (group), the first_name would be used as the display_name. This does introduce the possiblity that multiple users may have identical display names. In this situation, it would be up to the consumer of this to de-duplicate the users (such as also display the users email alongside).  examples:     display_name: user@example.com     display_name: all_users_group  | [optional] [readonly] 
**provider** | **str, none_type** | Upstream IdP name | [optional] 
**roles** | [**Roles**](Roles.md) |  | [optional] 
**org_id** | **str** | Unique identifier | [optional] 
**type** | **str** | Type of user | [optional] [readonly] 
**created** | **datetime** | Creation time | [optional] [readonly] 
**updated** | **datetime** | Update time | [optional] [readonly] 
**auto_created** | **bool** | Whether the user was automatically created as part of another process such as logging in. On creation, this flag being true serves to trigger any behaviour tied to automatically created users, such as addition to special groups. On read, it can serve to indicate whether the user was automatically created. On update it will ensure that the automatically triggered behaviour still holds true.  | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of False
**is_system_user** | **bool** | System users are controlled by the Agilicus infrastructure as part of providing service. Typically administrators and end users will not interact directly with them, so they should be hidden from display, unless explicitly toggled on.  | [optional] 
**upstream_user_identities** | [**[UpstreamUserIdentity]**](UpstreamUserIdentity.md) | The upstream identities this user can use to log in to the system. When a user logs in, their identity in this system will be determined by matching against this list. Note that this implies that entries in this list are globally unique.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**cascade** | **bool** | Whether the user will be added to sub organisations automatically. When set for a user that is a member of a particular organisation, subsequent creations of sub organisations will add this user to that suborgansation.  | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of False
**configured_attributes** | [**UserAttributes**](UserAttributes.md) |  | [optional] 
**attributes** | [**[UserAttribute]**](UserAttribute.md) | The live attributes of the user, as determined from all sources of attributes. A user&#39;s attributes flow from all of their upstream_user_identities as well as the &#x60;configured_attributes&#x60; field. Attributes are merged by name. If two sources of attributes have an attribute with the same name, that attribute will be merged. For cases where a merge is not possible -- e.g. two attributes with different types -- the oldest source of identity will be used. The &#x60;configured_attributes&#x60; field is always considered the oldest, so it has priority. Further, the resulting items will be sorted in ascending order of name.  For example, considering a user with following two sources of attributes:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; older_upstream:   - name: manager     value: best-manager   - name: groups     value: [\&quot;A\&quot;, \&quot;B\&quot;] newer_upstream:   - name: manager     value: other-manager   - name: groups     value: [\&quot;C\&quot;]   - name: age     value 32 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  The resulting attributes will be:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; attributes:   - name: age     value 32   - name: groups     value: [\&quot;A\&quot;, \&quot;B\&quot;, \&quot;C\&quot;]   - name: manager     value: best-manager &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  | [optional] [readonly] 
**inheritable_config** | [**InheritableUserConfig**](InheritableUserConfig.md) |  | [optional] 
**inheritable_status** | [**InheritableUserConfig**](InheritableUserConfig.md) |  | [optional] 
**disabled_at_time** | **datetime, none_type** | Optionally configure a user to be automatically disabled at a specific point in time. Any retrieval of the user object record past the disabled_at_time will result in the enabled property be set to false.  | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
