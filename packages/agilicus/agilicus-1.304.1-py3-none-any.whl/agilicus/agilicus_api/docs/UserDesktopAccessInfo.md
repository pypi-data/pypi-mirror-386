# UserDesktopAccessInfo

A UserDesktopAccessInfo describes whether a user has access to a desktop as well as various bits of metadata related to the desktop to help users navigate to it. If a user has access to an desktop, querying for that user will return information related to that desktop. If a desktop is public that desktop will also appear here.
