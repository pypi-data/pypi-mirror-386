# honeybee-energy

Honeybee extension for energy simulation.

This extension is intended to be generic such that it can represent energy properties
across multiple different energy simulation engines.

However, there are many parts of the extension that directly leverage
the [EnergyPlus](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus) simulation engine in order to make
[honeybee-core](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-core) models immediately
simulate-able.

The package can also leverage the [OpenStudio](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio) SDK
via the [honeybee-openstudio](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-openstudio)
Python package to translate honeybee Models to OpenStudio format.

All of these dependencies are contained within the [honeybee-energy Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ladybugtools/honeybee-energy)

Honeybee-energy is also used by other honeybee extensions that translate honeybee
models to building energy simulation engines, including
[honeybee-doe2](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-doe2) and
[honeybee_ph](https://github.com/PH-Tools/honeybee_ph).

## Installation

`pip install -U honeybee-energy`

If you want to also include the standards library of typical ProgramTypes and
ConstructionSets use:

`pip install -U honeybee-energy[standards]`

If you want to also include the honeybee-openstudio library to perform translations
to OpenStudio use:

`pip install -U honeybee-energy[openstudio]`

To check if the command line interface is installed correctly use `honeybee-energy --help`.
