    Given an audio and the PaSST model, return the probabilities of each AudioSet class.

    Audio is converted to mono at 32kHz.

    PaSST model is trained with 10 sec inputs. We refer to this parameter as the window_size.
    We set it to 10 sec for consistency with PaSST training.

    For longer audios, we split audio into overlapping analysis windows of window_size and overlap of 10 and 5 seconds.
    PaSST supports 10, 20 or 30 sec inputs. Not longer inputs: https://github.com/kkoutini/PaSST/issues/19 

    Note that AudioSet taggers normally use sigmoid output layers. Yet, to compute the
    KL we work with normalized probabilities by running a softmax over logits as in MusicGen:

    This implementation assumes run will be on GPU.

    Params:
    -- model: PaSST model on a GPU.
    -- audio_path: path to the audio to be loaded with librosa.
    -- window_size (default=10 sec): analysis window (and receptive field) of PaSST.
    -- overlap (default=5 sec): overlap of the running analysis window for inputs longar than window_size (10 sec).
    -- collect (default='mean'): for longer inputs, aggregate/collect via 'mean' or 'max' pooling along logits vector.

    GPU-based computation.
    
    Extracting the probabilities is timeconsuming. After being computed once, we store them.
    We store pre-computed reference probabilities in load/ 
    To load those and save computation, just set the path in load_ref_probabilities.
