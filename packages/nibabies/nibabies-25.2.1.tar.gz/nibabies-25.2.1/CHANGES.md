25.2.1 (October 22, 2025)
=========================
Patch release in the 25.2.x series.

Fixes an issue where when both T1w and T2w anatomical images were present, there was a potential incorrect count of T2w images - leading to downstream crashes.

### Bug Fixes
  * FIX: Incorrect number of found T2w scans (#498)

25.2.0 (September 25, 2025)
===========================
The first release of the 25.2.x series.

This release synchronizes with downstream dependencies, as well as
leverages TemplateFlow to retrieve intermediate transforms used during multi-step registration.

If you are reusing a previous TemplateFlow cache (which may be the case if running with
Apptainer / Singularity), you will need to clear or update your cache to ensure these new files
are available.

Thanks to @LuciMoore for the contribution!

Thanks to @joey-scanga for the contribution!

### Bug Fixes
  * FIX: Orient fieldmap before checking spline fit (#475)


25.1.0 (June 24, 2025)
======================
First release of the 25.1.x series. A few key changes include a new workflow
for derivatives compatibility when an anatomical template is not present, and performing
a two step registration (currently only for MNI152NLin6Asym) is now the default behavior.
This can be disabled by adding `--no-multi-step-reg` to the command.

### Enhancements
  * ENH: Verify derivatives are compatible with anatomical reference (#459)
  * ENH: Make `--multi-step-reg` a boolean action, enable by default (#470)

25.0.2 (May 19, 2025)
---------------------
A patch release including a couple key bug fixes:
 - Adds missing dependency to Docker image when BOLD coregistration falls back to FSL
 - Fixes connections to allow fieldmap-less SDC

Thanks to @joey-scanga for the contribution!

### Documentation

25.0.1 (February 5, 2025)
-------------------------
A bug-fix release to address an issue when using a precomputed mask for MCRIBS surface reconstruction without an anatomical template.

  * FIX: Match mask header prior to n4 correction (#443)


25.0.0 (January 28, 2025)
=========================
A new minor release with improvements to anatomical to template spatial normalization.

Registration will now prioritize the same modality as the anatomical template, if available.

A new flag `--norm-csf` performs CSF normalization on the anatomical template prior to template registration.

A new flag `--multi-step-reg` adds an intermediate step when registering to MNI152NLin6Asym, first performing anatomical -> MNIInfant:cohort-X (age matched by default), and then concatenates the transform with an already computed MNIInfant -> MNI152NLin6Asym.

Both of the new flags above are disabled by default, but have shown promise and may become defaults in the next release. Please experiment with your data, and any feedback on the results would be greatly appreciated!

  * ENH: Minimize clipping prior to surface reconstruction with MCRIBS (#436)

24.1.0 (October 02, 2024)
=========================

  * ENH: Add age to session report (#402)
  * ENH: Improvements to age parsing (#395, #398)

  * MAINT: Automate testing with tox (#404)
  * MAINT: Port over parser arguments and tests from fmriprep (#401)


24.0.1 (August 31, 2024)
========================
A patch release with a fix for the BOLD T2\* workflow. The command line argument  `--me-t2s-fit-method` was added for finer control when processing multi-echo datasets.

* FIX: Add missing me-t2s-fit-method option (#385)
* DOC: Reformat abbreviations (#386)


24.0.0 (August 29, 2024)
========================
This major release includes a substantial refactoring of the pipeline.

One key addition is the addition of the `--level` flag, which can take the arguments minimal, resampling or full. The default is full, which should produce nearly the same results as previous versions. minimal will produce only the minimum necessary to deterministically generate the remaining derivatives. resampling will produce some additional derivatives, intended to simplify resampling with other tools.

The `--derivatives` flag was altered to take arguments in the form `name=/path/to/dir`.
For each directory provided, if a derivative is found - it will be used instead of computing it from scratch. If a derivative is not found, NiBabies will compute it and proceed as usual.

Taken together, these features can allow a dataset provider to run a minimal NiBabies run, targeting many output spaces, while a user can then run a `--derivatives` run to generate additional derivatives in only the output spaces they need. Another use case is to provide an precomputed derivative to override the default NiBabies behavior, enabling easier workarounds for bugs or experimentation with alternatives.

Another new feature is a dynamic anatomical reference, which is set based on surface reconstruction method or through the `--reference-anatomical` flag. Previously, T1w was the default output space. Now, the reference anatomical is determined based on the surface reconstruction method.

Additionally, minor adjustments have been made to MCRIBS surface reconstruction to address failure rates. This is still an on-going investigation, but preliminary results look promising.

This release resolves a number of issues with fieldmaps inducing distortions during correction. Phase difference and direct fieldmaps are now masked correctly, preventing the overestimation of distortions outside the brain. Additionally, we now implement Jacobian weighting during unwarping, which corrects for compression and expansion effects on signal intensity. To disable Jacobian weighting, add `fmap-jacobian` to the `--ignore` argument.

Finally, a new resampling method has been added, to better account for susceptibility distortion and motion in a single shot resampling to a volumetric target space. We anticipate extending this to surface targets in the future.

  * FIX: nest pathlib import in fix_multi_source_name (#365)
  * FIX: Avoid retrieving multiple templates from latest TF (#353)
  * FIX: Raise informative error if no t1w or t2w found (#347)
  * FIX: Easier pyenv usage (#342)
  * FIX: Catch nonexistent derivatives, clean up subworkflow logic (#336)
  * FIX: Use fsLR reg sphere for MCRIBS morphometrics resampling (#334)

  * ENH: Alter outputs when MCRIBS reconstruction is used (#329)
  * ENH: Use nireports for Report generation + add reportlet per reconstruction (#328)
  * ENH: better repr for Derivatives class (#351)

  * RF: Move to fit/apply workflow (#360)

23.1.0 (November 22, 2023)
============
The next minor release of *NiBabies*, this release includes a number of new goodies, including:

### New surface reconstruction option
M-CRIB-S (Adamson et al., https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61326-2), has shown to improve performance in participants under 9 months. If you would like to try this method, add the following to your command: `--surface-recon-method mcribs`.

Note: Currently, a T2w image and pre-computed segmentation derivative must be provided to run mcribs.

### Improved batch processing
*NiBabies* now automatically parses the BIDS directory for participant ages, first searching in the
participant's `session.tsv`, and falling back to `participants.tsv`. This simplifies batch submissions including multiple subjects & sessions. As a result, the `--age-months` flag has been deprecated, and will be removed in a later release.

### Goodvoxels projection
An option to determine and exclude high-variance voxels from being projected to the surface when creating CIFTI files. To enable this, add `--project-goodvoxels` to your command.

### Single anatomical processing
Running *NiBabies* is now less restrictive, and will still process data missing either a T1w / T2w image. However, for best results, it is recommended to collect and include both for processing.

### Anat-specific derivatives inputs
Previous, *NiBabies* expected input from the `--derivatives` flag to be in T1w space, using the entity `space-orig`. This has now been changed to support derivatives in either T1w or T2w space. For more information, please see https://nibabies.readthedocs.io/en/23.1.0/faqs.html#leveraging-precomputed-results
