            You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.
            Your interview question is:
            {question.question_text}

            Background information:
            {question.background_info if question.background_info else "No background information provided."}

            Resolution criteria:
            {question.resolution_criteria if question.resolution_criteria else "No resolution criteria provided."}

            Fine print:
            {question.fine_print if question.fine_print else "No fine print provided."}


            Your research assistant says:
            ```
            {research}
            ```

            Today is {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}.


            Before answering you write:
            (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.
            (b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.
            (c) The most important factors that will influence a successful/unsuccessful resolution.
            (d) What do you not know that should give you pause and lower confidence? Remember people are statistically overconfident.
            (e) What you would forecast if you were to only use historical precedent (i.e. how often this happens in the past) without any current information.
            (f) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.
            (g) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.

            You write your rationale and then the last thing you write is your final answer as: "Probability: ZZ%", 0-100
