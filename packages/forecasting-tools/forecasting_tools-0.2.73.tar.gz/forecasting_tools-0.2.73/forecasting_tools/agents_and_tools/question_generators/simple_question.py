            - question_text: A clear question about a future event
            - resolution_criteria: Specific criteria for how the question will resolve. If possible include a link to a status page (e.g. a website with a live number or condition that is easy to resolve). Mention the units/scale expected (give an example like "a value of $1.2 million of income will resolve as '1.2'")
            - fine_print: Additional information covering *every* edge case that could happen. There should be no chance of an ambiguous resolution. Resolution criteria + fine print should pass the clairvoyance test such that after the event happens there is no debate about whether it happened or not no matter how it resolves.
            - background_information: Relevant context and historical information to help understand the question
            - expected_resolution_date: The date when the question is expected to resolve
            - question_type: The type of question, either binary, numeric, or multiple_choice based on how the forecaster should answer (with yes/no, a number, or a choice from a list)
            - options: The options for the question, only used for multiple_choice questions. Empty list for other question types.
            - open_upper_bound: Whether there can be a value higher than upper bound (e.g. if the value is a percentag, 100 is the max the bound is closed, but number of certifications in a population has an open upper bound), only used for numeric questions.
            - open_lower_bound: Whether there can be a value lower than lower bound (e.g. distances can't be negative the bound is closed at 0, but profit margins can be negative so the bound is open), only used for numeric questions.
            - max_value: The max value that the answer to the question can be. If bound is closed then choose the max number. If bound is open then pick a really really big number. Only used for numeric questions. (e.g. 100 for a percentage, 1000 for a number of certifications from an small org, 100000 for a number of new houses built in a large city in a year)
            - min_value: The min value that the answer to the question can be. If bound is closed then choose the min number. If bound is open then pick a really really negative number. Only used for numeric questions. (e.g. 0 for a percentage, 0 for a number of certifications from a small org, -10000000 for a medium company net profit)
