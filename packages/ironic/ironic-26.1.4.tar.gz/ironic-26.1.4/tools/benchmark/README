This folder contains two files:

* do_not_run_create_benchmark_data.py - This script will destroy your
  ironic database. DO NOT RUN IT. You have been warned!
  It is is intended to generate a semi-random database of node data
  which can be used for benchmarks, instead of crafting a raw SQL file
  representing a test model

* generate-statistics.py - This is a utility some statistics to both
  aid in basic benchmarking of ironic operations *and* provide developers
  with conceptual information regarding a deployment's size. It operates
  only by reading the data present and timing how long the result take to
  return as well as isolating some key details about the deployment.
