    Fixes ``idrac-wsman`` BIOS and RAID interface steps to correctly check
    status of iDRAC job that completed with errors. Now these jobs are treated
    as failures. Before this fix node stayed in wait state as it was only
    checking for "Completed" or "Failed" job status, but not "Completed
    with Errors".
