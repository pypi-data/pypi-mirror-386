    Adds new configuration option: ``[snmp]power_action_delay``
    This option will add a delay in seconds before a snmp power on and after
    power off. Which may be needed with some PDUs as they may not honor
    toggling a specific power port in rapid succession without a delay.
    This option may be useful if the attached physical machine has a
    substantial power supply to hold it over in the event of a brownout.
