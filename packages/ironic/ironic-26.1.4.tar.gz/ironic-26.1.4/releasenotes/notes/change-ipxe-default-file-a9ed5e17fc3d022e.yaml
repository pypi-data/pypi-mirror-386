    The default UEFI iPXE bootloader, ``[pxe]uefi_ipxe_bootfile_name`` used
    by the ``ipxe`` boot interface, has been changed from ``ipxe.efi`` to
    ``snponly.efi``. This is because most deployments actually need to use
    ``snponly.efi`` as it contains support for the UEFI integrated network
    stack, where as ``ipxe.efi`` does not and only contained compiled in
    network drivers, for UEFI, there happen to be few as the UEFI
    standard requires networking to be handled by the UEFI firmware.
