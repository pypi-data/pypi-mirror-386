features:
  - |
    Ironic now supports automatically setting node.lessee at deployment time
    using metadata provided at deploy time, typically by OpenStack Nova. When
    ``[conductor]/automatic_lessee_source`` is set to ``instance``,
    Ironic will set the lessee field on the node and remove it before cleaning.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``[conductor]/automatic_lessee`` has been deprecated in favor of
    ``[conductor]/automatic_lessee_source``.

    Standalone Ironic deployments previously setting ``automatic_lessee`` to
    ``True`` now may want to set ``automatic_lessee_source`` to ``request`` to
    retain existing behavior.

    Deployers explicitly setting ``automatic_lessee`` to false may want to set
    ``automatic_lessee_source`` to ``none`` to retain existing behavior. The
    old configuration option, when explicitly set, will be honored until
    fully removed.
  - |
    Ironic will now automatically set the node.lessee field for all
    deployments by default when provided in node instance_info at deployment
    time. Deployers are encouraged to review their security settings and
    Ironic Secure RBAC documentation to ensure no unexpected access is granted.
