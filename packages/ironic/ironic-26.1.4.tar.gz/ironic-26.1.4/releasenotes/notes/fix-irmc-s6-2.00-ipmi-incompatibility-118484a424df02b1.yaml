    Fixes a firmware incompatibility issue with iRMC versions S6 2.00
    and later now doesn't support IPMI over LAN by default.
    To deal with this problem, irmc driver first tries IPMI operation then,
    if IPMI operation fails, it tries Redfish API of Fujitsu server.
    The operator must set Redfish parameters in the ``driver_info``
    if iRMC disable or doesn't support IPMI over LAN.

    When Ironic operator uses irmc driver against Fujitsu server which runs
    iRMC version S6 2.00 or later, operator may need to set Redfish parameters
    in ``driver_info`` so this fix can operate properly or operator should
    enable IPMI over LAN through BMC settings, if possible.
