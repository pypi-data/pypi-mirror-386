    Fix ``idrac-redfish`` clean/deploy step ``import_configuration`` to handle
    completed import configuration tasks that are deleted by iDRAC before
    Ironic has checked task's status.
    Prior iDRAC firmware version 5.00.00.00 completed tasks are deleted after
    1 minute in iDRAC Redfish. That is not always sufficient to check for
    their status in periodic check that runs every minute by default. Before
    this fix node got stuck in wait mode forever. This is fixed by failing the
    step with error informing to decrease periodic check interval or upgrade
    iDRAC firmware if not done already.
