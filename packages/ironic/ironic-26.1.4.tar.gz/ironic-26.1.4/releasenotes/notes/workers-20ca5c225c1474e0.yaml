issues:
  - |
    When configuring a single-conductor environment, make sure the number
    of worker pools (``[conductor]worker_pool_size``) is larger than the
    maximum parallel deployments (``[conductor]max_concurrent_deploy``).
    This was not the case by default previously (the options used to be set
    to 100 and 250 accordingly).
upgrade:
  - |
    Because of a fix in the internal worker pool handling, you may now start
    seeing requests rejected with HTTP 503 under a very high load earlier than
    before. In this case, try increasing the ``[conductor]worker_pool_size``
    option or consider adding more conductors.
  - |
    The default worker pool size (the ``[conductor]worker_pool_size`` option)
    has been increased from 100 to 300. You may want to consider increasing
    it even further if your environment allows that.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes handling new requests when the maximum number of internal workers
    is reached. Previously, after reaching the maximum number of workers
    (100 by default), we would queue the same number of requests (100 again).
    This was not intentional, and now Ironic no longer queues requests if
    there are no free threads to run them.
