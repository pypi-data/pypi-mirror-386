deprecations:

    The ``[[agent]]manage_agent_boot`` configuration directive is being
    deprecated. It is completely untested, and requires operators to
    manually configure significant parts of infrastructure typically
    handled by Ironic. Operators using this configuration are advised
    to migrate away from it before it's scheduled removal during the
    2025.2 cycle releases, coming out late 2025.
