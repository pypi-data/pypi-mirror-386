    Ability to create an allocation has been restricted by a new policy rule
    ``baremetal::allocation::create_pre_rbac`` which prevents creation of
    allocations by any project administrator when operating with the new
    Role Based Access Control model. The use and enforcement of this
    rule is disabled when ``[oslo_policy]enforce_new_defaults`` is set which
    also makes the population of a ``owner`` field for allocations to
    become automatically populated. Most deployments should not encounter any
    issues with this security change, and the policy rule will be removed
    when support for the legacy ``baremetal_admin`` custom role has been
    removed.
