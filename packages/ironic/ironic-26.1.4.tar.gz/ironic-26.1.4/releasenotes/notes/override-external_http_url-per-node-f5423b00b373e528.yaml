    Nodes using virtual media can now specify their own external URL.
    This setting can be leveraged via the ``driver_info\external_http_url``
    node setting.
    When used, this setting overrides the ``[deploy]http_url`` and
    ``[deploy]external_http_url`` settings in the configuration file.
