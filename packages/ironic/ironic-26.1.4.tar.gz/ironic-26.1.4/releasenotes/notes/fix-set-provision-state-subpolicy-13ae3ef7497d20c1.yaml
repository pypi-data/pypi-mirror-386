    Fixes newly added policy rules,
    ``baremetal:node:set_provision_state:clean_steps`` and
    ``baremetal:node:set_provision_state:service_steps``which impacted
    ``project scoped`` users utilizing the ``2024.2`` release of Ironic
    where they were attempting to invoke ``service`` or ``clean``
    provision state commands.
    This was due to a misunderstanding of the correct policy checker to
    invoke, and additional testing has been added around these functions
    to ensure they work as expected moving forward.
