    Resolved ``clear_job_queue`` and ``reset_idrac`` verify step failures which
    occur when the functionality is not supported by the iDRAC. When this
    condition is detected, the code in the step handles the exception and logs
    a warning and completes successfully in case of verification steps but
    fails in case of cleaning steps.
