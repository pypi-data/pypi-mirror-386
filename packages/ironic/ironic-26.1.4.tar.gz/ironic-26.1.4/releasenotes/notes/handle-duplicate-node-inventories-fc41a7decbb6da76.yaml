    Fixes a bug that occurs when a node is inspected more than once and the
    database is configured as a storage backend: a new node inventory entry
    is added in the database for each inspection result, causing more than one
    inventory to exist for the node in the node_inventory table.

    This is handled by:

    * Deleting any previous inventory entries for a node before adding a new
      entry in the database.
    * Retrieving the most recent node inventory from the database when the
      database is queried. (To cater for databases that already contain
      duplicate node inventories due to the bug.)
