    Fixes an issue where cleaning operations could fail in such a way that was
    not easily recoverable when pre-cleaning network interface configuration
    was validated, yet contained invalid configuration.
    Now Ironic properly captures the error and exits from cleaning in a
    state which allows for cleaning to be retried.
