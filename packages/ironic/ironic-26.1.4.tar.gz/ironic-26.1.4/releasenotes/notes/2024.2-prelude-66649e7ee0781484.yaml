    The Ironic project is pleased to announce the release Ironic 26.1,
    also known as the ``2024.2`` or ``Dalmatian`` release. This release adds
    functionality to enable the creation and use of ``runbooks`` of repeated
    steps in ``cleaning`` and ``service`` states. Furthermore, cloud admins
    are now able to ``lease`` baremetal nodes to Nova users automatically
    through the use of metadata provided by Nova. Firmware updates have
    improved capability and ease-of-use on BMCs which manage multiple hosts.
    Also users of the ``redfish`` hardware type can now invoke firmware updates
    as a ``service`` step. Operators seeking to migrate away from BIOS booting
    now have additional options to help enforce migration mandates.
    Coupled with numerous bug fixes and other minor enhancements, this release
    of Ironic will improve the life of operators for years to come.
    We hope you enjoy!
