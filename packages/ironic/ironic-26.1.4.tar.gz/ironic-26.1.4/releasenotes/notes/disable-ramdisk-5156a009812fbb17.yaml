    Adds a new ``disable_ramdisk`` parameter to the manual cleaning API. If set
    to ``true``, IPA won't get booted for cleaning. Only steps explicitly
    marked as compatible can be executed this way.

    The parameter is available in the API version 1.70.

    Clean steps can now be marked with ``requires_ramdisk=False`` to make them
    compatible with the new ``disable_ramdisk`` argument of the manual cleaning
    API.
