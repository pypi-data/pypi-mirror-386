features:

    Adds capability to use ``project`` scoped requests in concert with
    ``system`` scoped requests for a composite Role Based Access Control
    (RBAC) model. As Ironic is mainly an administrative service,
    this capability has only been extended to API endpoints which are
    not purely administrative in nature. This consists of the following
    API endpoints: nodes, ports, portgroups, volume connectors, volume
    targets, and allocations.
  - |
    Project ``scoped`` requests for baremetal allocations, will automatically
    record the ``project_id`` of the requester as the ``owner`` of the node.
deprecations:
  - >
    Pre-RBAC support rules have been deprecated. These consist of:
      * admin_api
      * is_member
      * is_observer
      * is_node_owner
      * is_node_lessee
      * is_allocation_owner

    These rules will likely be removed in the Xena development cycle.
    Operators are advised to review any custom policy rules for these
    rules and move to the `Secure Role Based Access Controls <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/secure-rbac.html>`_
    model.
issues:
  - |
    The addition of both ``project`` and ``system`` scoped Role Based Access
    controls does add additional database queries when linked resources are
    accessed. Example, when attempting to access a ``port`` or ``portgroup``,
    the associated node needs to be checked as this helps govern overall
    object access to the object for ``project`` scoped requests. This does not
    impact ``system`` scoped requests. Operators who adopt project scoped
    access may find it necessary to verify or add additional database indexes
    in relation to the node ``uuid`` column as well as ``node_id`` field in
    any table which may receive heavy project query scope activity.
    The ``ironic`` project anticipates that this will be a future work item
    of the project to help improve database performance.
upgrade:
  - |
    Legacy policy rules have been deprecated. Operators are advised to review
    and update any custom policy files in use. Please see
    `Secure Role Based Access Controls`_ for more information.
