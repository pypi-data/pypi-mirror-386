features:
  - |
    Adds a capability for synchronous steps to be executed through the
    cleaning and deployment steps framework upon child nodes, as associated
    through the ``parent_node`` field. The new, optional step arguments are
    a boolean value of ``execute_on_child_nodes``, and
    ``limit_child_node_execution`` which consists of a list of node UUIDs.
    The ability to invoke this permission requires the ability to
    set a provision state action upon the child node in the RBAC model.
  - |
    Adds a ``power_on``, ``power_on``, and ``reboot`` reserved step name
    actions which toggles power through the conductor. This allows embedded
    devices such as child nodes to have power state toggled as part
    of the parent node's cleaning or deployment sequence, if so stated
    through the supplied configuration or deployment template.
