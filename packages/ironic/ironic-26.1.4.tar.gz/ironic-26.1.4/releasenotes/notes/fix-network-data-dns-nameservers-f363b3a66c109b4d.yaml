    The network_data fetched from Neutron contained 'links',
    'networks' but was missing 'services'. This patch brings
    in 'services' to include dns nameservers that can be
    configured by Glean or cloud-init during cleaning and
    provisioning operations, especially when virtual media
    boot is used without DHCP.
