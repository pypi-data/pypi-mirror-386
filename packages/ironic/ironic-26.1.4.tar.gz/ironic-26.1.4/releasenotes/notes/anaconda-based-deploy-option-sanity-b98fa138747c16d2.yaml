fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue where ``root_gb`` became a required field when using the
    ``anaconda`` deployment interface, with a recent bug fix as the code path
    largely expected all deployment operations to utilize images, which is
    not the case. The case handling for non-image based deployments is now
    explicitly in internal parameter validation code.
  - |
    Fixes handling of ``image_source`` parameters where internal validations
    would not gracefully handle received redirects and treat it as a failure.
    We now no longer explicitly fail when a redirect is received.
  - |
    Fixes an issue where an ``image_source`` could not be set to a mirror URL
    to facilitate deployments using a mirror with the ``anaconda`` deployment
    interface. Ironic still presently has an explicit requirement on a
    ``stage2`` parameter to be explicitly defined.
other:
  - |
    Adds documentation of standalone deployment use case with the ``anaconda``
    deployment interface.
