    When an ``http(s)://`` image is used, the cached copy of the image will always
    be updated if the HTTP server does not provide the last modification date
    and time. Previously the cached image would be considered up-to-date, which
    could cause invalid behavior if the image is generated on fly or was modified
    while being served.
