    Previously the key for building temporary URLs from Swift was taken from the
    `x-account-meta-temp-url-key` header in the object store account. Now the
    header `x-account-meta-temp-url-key-2` is also checked, which allows
    password rotation to occur without breaking old URLs.

    This applies to the following temporary URL scenarios:

    * Temp URL image transfer from Glance
      (when `[glance]swift_temp_url_key` is not set)
    * Publishing an image with the Swift publisher
      (`[redfish]use_swift=True` or `[ilo]use_web_server_for_images=False`)
    * Storing the config drive in Swift
      (`[deploy]configdrive_use_object_store=True`)
    * Fetching Swift stored firmware update payloads.

    `python-swiftclient` is no longer a dependency, all OpenStack Swift
    operations are now down using `openstacksdk`.

    Configuration option `[swift]swift_max_retries` has been removed and any
    custom value will no longer have any effect on failed object-store
    operations.
