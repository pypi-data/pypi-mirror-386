    Fixes an issue where unexpected exceptions coming from the process to
    start cleaning would not trigger the cleaning_error_handler which
    performs the needful internal resets to permit cleaning to be retried
    again in the future. Now any error which is encountered during the
    launch of cleaning will trigger the error handler.
