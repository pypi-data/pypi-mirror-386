    Fixes the bug where provisioning a Redfish managed node fails if the BMC
    doesn't support EthernetInterfaces attribute, even if MAC address
    information is provided manually. This is done by handling of
    MissingAttributeError sushy exception in get_mac_addresses() method.
    This fix is needed to successfully provision machines such as Cisco UCSB
    and UCSX.
