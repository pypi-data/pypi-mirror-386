    Adds a capability to allow bootloaders to be copied into the configured
    network boot path. This capability can be opted in by using the
    ``[pxe]loader_file_paths`` by being set to a list of key, value pairs
    of destination filename, and source file path.

    .. code-block::

       [pxe]
       loader_file_paths = bootx64.efi:/path/to/shimx64.efi,grubx64.efi:/path/to/grubx64.efi
