issues:
  - |
    Testing of the ``http`` boot interface with Ubuntu 22.04 provided Grub2
    yielded some intermittent failures which appear to be more environmental
    in nature as the signed Shim loader would start, then load the GRUB
    loader, and then some of the expected files might be attempted to be
    accessed, and then fail due to an apparent transfer timeout. Consultation
    with some grub developers concur this is likely environmental, meaning
    the specific grub build or CI performance related. If you encounter any
    issues, please do not hestitate to reach out to the Ironic developer
    community.
