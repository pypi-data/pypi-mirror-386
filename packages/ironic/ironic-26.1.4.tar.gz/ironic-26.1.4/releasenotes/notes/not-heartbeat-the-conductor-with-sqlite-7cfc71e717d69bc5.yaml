deprecations:
  - |
    The use of a SQLite database with mutli-process (i.e. ``ironic-api`` and
    ``ironic-conductor`` services) is not supported, and the ability to launch
    a dedicated ``ironic-api`` process with a SQLite database backend will
    be an error in the future. In this case, the single process combined
    API and Conductor service should be utilized.
fixes:
  - |
    Database locks with a ``sqlite`` database backend should now be lessened
    as the conductor will no longer perform a keepalive heartbeat operation
    when the use of SQLite has been detected.
