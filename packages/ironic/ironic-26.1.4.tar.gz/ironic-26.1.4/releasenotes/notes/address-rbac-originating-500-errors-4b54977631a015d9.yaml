    Some of Ironic's API endpoints, when the new RBAC policy is being enforced,
    were previously emitting *500* error codes when insufficient access rights were
    being used, specifically because the policy required ``system`` scope. This
    has been corrected, and the endpoints should now properly signal a *403* error
    code if insufficient access rights are present for an authenticated requester.
