upgrade:
  - |
    Adds an upgrade status check for the Allocation table engine and
    character set encoding on MySQL. This is a result of a missing
    encoding definition on the table schema when originally created.
    This issue will be remedied, in part, in a later version of Ironic,
    but the upgrade status check will provide advance operator visibility.
