    Adds ``import_configuration``, ``export_configuration`` and
    ``import_export_configuration`` steps to ``idrac-redfish`` management
    interface. These steps allow to use configuration from another system as
    template and replicate that configuration to other, similarly capable,
    systems. Currently, this feature is experimental.
