features:
  - |
    The ``irmc-virtual-media`` boot interface now supports setting kernel
    parameters via the ``kernel_append_params`` option in both the node's
    ``driver_info`` and ``instance_info``. This only applies when an image
    is built from a kernel and an initramfs, not when a pre-built ISO is used.
deprecations:
  - |
    Using ``[pxe]kernel_append_params`` for the iRMC boot interface is now
    deprecated, please use ``[irmc]kernel_append_params``.
