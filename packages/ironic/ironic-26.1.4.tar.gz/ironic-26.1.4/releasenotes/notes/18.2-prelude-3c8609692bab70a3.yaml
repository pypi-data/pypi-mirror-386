    The Ironic team hearby announces the release of Ironic 18.2.

    During the Xena development cycle, thirty eight contributors collaborated
    together, and with our adjacent communities to support the needs of our
    end users in all the many forms they take. Over 48,000 lines of code were
    modified, and twenty two new features made it into Ironic along with
    a number of bug fixes. We sincerely hope you enjoy!
