deprecations:
  - |
    The node's ``driver_info`` parameter ``config_via_floppy`` of the
    ``redfish-virtual-media`` boot interface has been renamed to
    ``config_via_removable``. The old alias is deprecated.
features:
  - |
    Supplying configuration to the agent using the ``redfish-virtual-media``
    boot interface now works through USB instead of floppy by default. Modern
    hardware (and even virtual machines) has limited support for floppies.
