upgrade:
  - |
    The query pattern for the database when lists of nodes are retrieved has
    been changed to a more efficient pattern at scale, where a list of nodes
    is generated, and then additional queries are executed to composite this
    data together. This is from a model where the database client in the
    conductor was having to deduplicate the resulting data set which is
    overall less efficient.
other:
  - |
    The default database query pattern has been changed which will result
    in additional database queries when compositing lists of ``nodes``
    by separately querying ``traits`` and ``tags``. Previously this was a
    joined query which requires deduplication of the result set before
    building composite objects.
