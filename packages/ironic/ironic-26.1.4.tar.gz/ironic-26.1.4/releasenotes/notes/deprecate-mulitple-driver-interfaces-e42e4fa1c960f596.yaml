deprecations:
  - |
    The ``ibmc`` hardware type is deprecated due to a lack of upstream
    communication, driver maintenance, and a recognition that the Redfish
    hardware type likely works for the users at this point. This driver is
    expected to be removed during the ``2024.2`` development cycle.
  - The ``xclarity`` hardware type is deprecated due to a lack of upstream
    communication, driver maintenance, and a recognition that the Redfish
    hardware type is suitable for Lenovo hardware users moving forward.
    This driver is expected to be removed during the ``2024.2`` development
    cycle.
  - The ``idrac-wsman`` interfaces on the ``idrac`` hardware type are
    deprecated due to a lack of upstream communication, and the decision of
    the driver's maintainer in the past to move in to the direction of
    using Redfish for driver interactions.
    These driver interfaces are expected to be removed during the
    ``2024.2`` development cycle.
other:
  - The classic ``ilo`` hardware types may be deprecated in the future for
    removal or major changes, however our last communication with the
    maintainers as of the ``2024.1`` Project Teams Gathering sessions
    indicated they were still working to determine their own forward
    path with a strong emphasis on the use of Redfish.
