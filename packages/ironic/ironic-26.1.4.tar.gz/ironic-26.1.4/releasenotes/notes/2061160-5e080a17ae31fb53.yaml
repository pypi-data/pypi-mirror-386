    Fixes an issue with units tests that show this DeprecationWarning:
    The metaschema specified by $schema was not found. Using the latest
    draft to validate, but this will raise an error in the future.
    cls = validator_for(schema)
    Removed the warning for deprecated schema by using a new template.
