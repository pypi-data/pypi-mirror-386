features:
  - |
    Adds the concept of ``parent_node`` which allows a "child node", such as
    an independently managed BMC controlled device deployed within a
    ``parent_node`` as part of API version *1.83*. Child nodes are hidden
    from normal node lists as they are not "general purpose" machines,
    but have a specific embedded usage. In this model, RBAC rules also apply
    so if you wish an ``owner`` or ``lessee`` to have the child node visible,
    they must also have the the appropriate ``owner`` or ``lessee`` value set
    matching the parent node.
  - |
    Adds a ``/v1/nodes/?include_children=True`` parameter to get a list of
    all nodes and their children.
  - |
    Adds a ``/v1/nodes/?parent_node=<node_ident>`` query parameter to permit
    retrieval of a list of child nodes assigned to the parent denoted by
    ``<node_ident>``.
upgrade:
  - |
    This upgrade contains an additional field for the ``nodes`` table, named
    ``parent_node``. This update also indexes the ``parent_node`` database
    column to prevent performance issues in large deployments.
