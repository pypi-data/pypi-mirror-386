    While investigating `bug 2033430 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2033430>`_
    we discovered we were emitting DHCP option 210 *only* with OVN, and never
    emitted it with dnsmasq because it was not being set previously. Our
    internal notes also indicated this was for PXELinux support, but was
    never actually needed. As it was excess, and redundant configuration
    being provided to Neutron, it has been removed.
