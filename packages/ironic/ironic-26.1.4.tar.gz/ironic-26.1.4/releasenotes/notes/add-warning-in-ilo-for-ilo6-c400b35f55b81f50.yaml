    Fixes a vague error when attempting to use the ``ilo`` hardware type with
    iLO6 hardware, by returning a more specific error suggesting action to
    take in order to remedy the issue. Specifically, one of the API's
    used by the ``ilo`` hardware type is disabled in iLO6 BMCs in favor
    of users utilizing Redfish. Operators are advised to utilize the
    ``redfish`` hardware type for these machines.
