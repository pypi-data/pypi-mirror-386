    Anaconda supports the ability to explicitly pass a URL instead
    of a ``stage2`` ramdisk parameter. This has resulted in confusion
    in use of the ``anaconda`` deployment interface, as a ``stage2``
    ramdisk is typically not used, but made sense with Glance images in
    a fully integrated OpenStack deployment. Now a URL to a path can be
    supplied to the ``anaconda`` deployment interface to simplify the
    interaction and use, and a redundant ``stage2`` parameter is no longer
    required.
