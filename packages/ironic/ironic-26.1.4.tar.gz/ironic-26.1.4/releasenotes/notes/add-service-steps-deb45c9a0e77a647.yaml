features:

    Adds a new Ironic capability called ``service_steps`` which allows a
    deployed ``ACTIVE`` node to be modified utilizing a new API provision
    state verb of ``service`` which can include a list of ``service_steps``
    to be performed. This work is inspired by ``clean_steps`` and
    ``deploy_steps`` and similar to those efforts, this functionality will
    continue to evolve as new features, functionality, and capabilities
    are added.
  - Adds a new driver method decorator ``base.service_step`` which operates
    exactly like the existing ``base.clean_step`` and ``base.deploy_step``
    decorators. Driver methods which are decorated *can* be invoked utilizing
    the service steps.
