    The default value of the configuration option
    ``[inspector]require_managed_boot`` is now ``True`` for the newer ``agent``
    inspect interface. The older ``inspector`` implementation is not affected.
    Operators with deployments that support unmanaged inspection must set
    this value to ``False`` explicitly.
