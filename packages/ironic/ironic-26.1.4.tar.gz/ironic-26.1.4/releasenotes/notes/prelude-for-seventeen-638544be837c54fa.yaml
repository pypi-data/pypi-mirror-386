    The Ironic community is proud to release Ironic 17.0!

    Where if it were developer years instead of major versions,
    we would all be very afraid since it already has access to
    the car keys.

    This release of Ironic includes numerous advancements which extend
    an operator's ability to customize and further extend their deployment
    to meet their needs.

    * Redfish enhancements including Out of Band RAID configuration management
      and automatic setting of Secure Boot on nodes deployed using
      ``redfish``.
    * Deployment enhancements including UEFI Partition Image handling,
      per-instance per-deployments of default interface selections, user
      requestable ``deploy_steps`` at deploy time, IPA file
      injection, and support for setting a node's boot mode via
      ``instance_info``.
    * Support for ``system`` scoped Role Based Access controls *and*
      ``project`` scoped access is available by default for associated
      nodes when the ``node`` ``owner`` or ``lessee`` fields are set.
      This effort alone added over 1,500 new unit tests.
    * Operator friendly fixes such as memory over-consumption guard for
      memory intensive tasks, vendor hardware aware handling to help
      address issues such as different settings being needed to invoke UEFI,
      and "lazy" loading of database attributes to reduce the overall database
      load.

    Along with all of this massive amount of work, a number of bugs were fixed
    while we were along the road trip of this development cycle.

    We sincerely hope you enjoy it!
