    Adds a new feature to permit Ironic to automatically provide an instance
    requester's project, ``lessee`` rights to the Bare Metal machine under
    the Role Based Access Control model implemented in Ironic. It does this
    by saving the project ID of the requester to the Node ``lessee`` field
    automatically, and removing the rights when undeploying the machine.
    This feature, is normally disabled, but can be enabled using the
    ``[conductor]automatic_lessee`` configuration option. This option will not
    work in a mixed-version upgrade with older API services.
