    Fixes an issue in db schema version testing where objects with a initial
    version, e.g. "1.0", are allowed to not already have their DB tables
    pre-exist when performing the pre-upgrade compatibility check for the
    database. This allows the upgrade to proceed and update the database
    schema without an explicit known list having to be maintained in Ironic.

    Removes a ``NEW_MODELS`` internal list from the dbsync utility which
    helped the tool navigate new models, however it was never used. Instead
    the tool now utilizes the database version and appropriate base version
    to make the appropriate decision in pre-upgrade checks.
