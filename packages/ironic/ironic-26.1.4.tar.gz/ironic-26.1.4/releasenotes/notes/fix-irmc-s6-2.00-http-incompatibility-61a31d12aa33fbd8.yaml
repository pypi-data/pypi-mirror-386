    Since iRMC versions S6 2.00 and later, iRMC firmware doesn't
    support HTTP connection to REST API. Operators need to set
    ``[irmc] port`` in ironic.conf or ``driver_info/irmc_port``
    to 443.

    Adds verify step and node vendor passthru method to deal with
    a firmware incompatibility issue with iRMC versions S6 2.00
    and later in which HTTP connection to REST API is not supported
    and HTTPS connections to REST API is required.

    Verify step checks connection to iRMC REST API and if connection
    succeeds, it fetches version of iRMC firmware and store it in
    ``driver_internal_info/irmc_fw_version``. Ironic operators use
    node vendor passthru method to fetch & update iRMC firmware
    version cached in ``driver_internal_info/irmc_fw_version``.
