features:
  - |
    The ``redfish-virtual-media``, ``ilo-virtual-media`` and
    ``idrac-redfish-virtual-media`` boot interfaces now support
    ``kernel_append_params`` not only in the node's ``instance_info``, but also
    ``driver_info``. This only applies when the boot image is built from
    a kernel and an initramfs, not when a pre-built ISO is used.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``ilo-virtual-media`` boot interface has previously declared support
    for the ``ilo_kernel_append_params`` option in ``driver_info``. It has
    never been implemented in reality and has been replaced by the new
    ``kernel_append_params``.
