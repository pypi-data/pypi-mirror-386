    Resolve issue where ``[conductor]clean_step_priority_override`` values
    are applied too late, after disabled steps have been already filtered out.
    With this change, priority overrides are applied prior to filtering out
    disabled steps, so that this configuration option can use used to enable
    or disable steps (in particular clean steps) in addition to changing
    priorities they are run with.
