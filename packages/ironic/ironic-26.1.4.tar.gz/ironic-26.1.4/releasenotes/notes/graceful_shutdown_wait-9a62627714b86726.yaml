    On shutdown the conductor will wait for at most
    ``[DEFAULT]graceful_shutdown_timeout`` seconds for existing lock node
    reservations to clear. Previously lock reservations were cleared
    immediately, which in some cases would result in nodes going into a failed
    state.

    ``[DEFAULT]graceful_shutdown_timeout`` defaults to 60s. Systemd
    ``TimeoutStopSec`` defaults to 30s. Kubernetes
    ``terminationGracePeriodSeconds`` defaults to 90s. It is recommended to
    align the value of ``[DEFAULT]graceful_shutdown_timeout`` with the graceful
    timeout of the process manager of the conductor process.
