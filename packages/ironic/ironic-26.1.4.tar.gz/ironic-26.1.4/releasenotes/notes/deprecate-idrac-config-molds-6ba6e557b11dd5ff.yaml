deprecations:
  - |
    The ``idrac`` hardware type management interface steps
    ``import_configuration`` and ``export_configuration`` steps are
    deprecated, and will be removed once a formalized generic step
    templating mechanism has been created within Ironic. The Ironic
    community is open to reconsidering this decision should the
    overall bulk configuration reset/templating model become adopted
    by DMTF Redfish as a standardized cross-vendor feature.
