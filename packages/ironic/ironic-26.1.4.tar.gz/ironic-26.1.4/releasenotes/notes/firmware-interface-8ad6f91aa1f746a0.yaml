    Adds Firmware Interface support to ironic, we would like to receive
    feedback since this is a new feature we introduced and we as a developer
    community have limited hardware access, reach out to us in case of any
    unexpected behavior.

    - Adds version 1.86 of the Bare Metal API, which includes:

      * List all firmware components of a node via the
        ``GET /v1/nodes/{node_ident}/firmware`` API.

      * The ``firmware_interface`` field of the node resource. A firmware
        interface can be set when creating or updating a node.

      * The ``default_firmware_interface`` and ``enabled_firmware_interface``
        fields of the driver resource.

    - Adds new configuration options for the firmware interface feature:

      * Firmware interfaces are enabled via
        ``[DEFAULT]/enabled_firmware_interfaces``. A default firmware
        interface to use when creating or updating nodes can be specified with
        ``[DEFAULT]/default_firmware_interface``.

    - Available interfaces: ``redfish``, ``no-firmware`` and ``fake``.

    - Support to update firmware of BIOS and BMC via ``update`` step, can be
      done via clean or deploy steps, the node should be using the
      ``redfish`` driver and set the  ``firmware_interface``.
