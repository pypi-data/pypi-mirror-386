    When changing from glanceclient to OpenStack SDK to communicate with
    Glance, a bug was introduced reading image properties causing the
    Anaconda deploy interface to be unable to use Glance images. Other
    deploy interfaces continued to function but could have resulted in
    some properties not taking affect.
    See `bug 2099275 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2099953>`_ for
    more details.
