    Removing `?filename=file.iso` suffix from the virtual media image URL
    when the image is a regular file due to incompatibility with SuperMicro
    X12 machines which do not accept special characters such as `=` or `?`
    in the URL. Historically, this suffix was being added to improve
    compatibility with those BMCs which require `.iso` suffix in the URL
    while using swift as the image store. Old behaviour will remain for swift
    backed images.
