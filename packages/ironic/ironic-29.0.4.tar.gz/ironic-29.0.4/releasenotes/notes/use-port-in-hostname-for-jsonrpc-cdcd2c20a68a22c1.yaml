    Adds the storage of the ``[json_rpc]port`` configuration value to the
    internal conductor hostname field when the ``[DEFAULT]rpc_transport``
    setting is set to "json-rpc". This allows deployments to utilize varying
    port configurations for JSON-RPC. As a result of this change, the RPC
    API version has been incremented to ``1.57`` and the feature is not
    available until any ``[DEFAULT]pin_release_version`` setting is removed.
upgrade:
  - |
    Operators utilizing JSON-RPC transport to conductors with a non-default
    port configuration should expect to see the hash ring layout change as
    the port number is now included in the hash ring calculation. This will
    only occur once the hash ring pin has been removed.
  - Requires ``ironic-lib`` version *5.5.0* for the json-rpc port to be
    properly set and utilized.
