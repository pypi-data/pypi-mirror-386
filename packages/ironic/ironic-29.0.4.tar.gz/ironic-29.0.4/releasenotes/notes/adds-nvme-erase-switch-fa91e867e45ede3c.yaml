features:
  - |
    Adds the ``[deploy]enable_nvme_secure_erase`` option which allows the
    operator to enable NVMe format option for all nodes being managed by
    the conductor.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecates ATA specific ``agent_continue_if_ata_erase_failed`` agent's
    option which is replaced with ``agent_continue_if_secure_erase_failed``.
    The new option supports both ATA and NVMe secure erase. In order to ensure
    a smooth migration to the new configuration option, the operators need to
    upgrade Ironic Python Agent image to Wallaby release prior to upgrading
    Ironic Conductor to Xena.
