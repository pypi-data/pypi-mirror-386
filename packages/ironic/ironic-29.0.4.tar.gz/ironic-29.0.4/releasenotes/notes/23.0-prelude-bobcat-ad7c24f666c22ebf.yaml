prelude: |
    Ironic is proud to announce the release of 23.0, the capstone release of a
    six month OpenStack 2023.2 (Bobcat) cycle.

    Our focus this cycle has been on improving the ability for operators to
    secure and service their Ironic nodes. There are also, as always, a myriad
    of quality of life fixes, including improvements to sqlite support,
    and graceful shutdown of conductors.

    We hope the latest release of Ironic serves you well!
