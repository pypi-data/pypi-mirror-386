    Fixes the default value for the ``[DEFAULT]grub_config_path`` variable to
    be the default path for UEFI bootloader configurations, where as the
    default was previously the BIOS grub2 configuration path.
upgrades:
  - |
    The default configuration value for ``[DEFAULT]grub_config_path`` has
    been changed from ``/boot/grub/grub.conf`` to ``EFI/BOOT/grub.efi`` as
    the configuration parameter was for UEFI boot configuration, and the
    ``/boot/grub/grub2.conf`` path is for BIOS booting. This was verified
    by referencing several working UEFI virtual media examples where this
    value was overridden to the new configuration value.
