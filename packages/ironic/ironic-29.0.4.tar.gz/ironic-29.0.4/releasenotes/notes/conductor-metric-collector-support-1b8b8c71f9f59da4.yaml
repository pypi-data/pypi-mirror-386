features:
  - |
    Adds the ability for Ironic to send conductor process metrics
    for monitoring. This requires the use of a new ``[metrics]backend``
    option value of ``collector``. This data was previously only available
    through the use of statsd. This requires ``ironic-lib`` version ``5.4.0``
    or newer. This capability can be disabled using the
    ``[sensor_data]enable_for_conductor`` option if set to False.
  - |
    Adds a ``[sensor_data]enable_for_nodes`` configuration option
    to allow operators to disable sending node metric data via the
    message bus notifier.
  - |
    Adds a new gauge metric ``ConductorManager.PowerSyncNodesCount``
    which tracks the nodes considered for power state synchrnozation.
  - Adds a new gauge metric ``ConductorManager.PowerSyncRecoveryNodeCount``
    which represents the number of nodes which are being evaluated for power
    state recovery checking.
  - Adds a new gauge metric ``ConductorManager.SyncLocalStateNodeCount``
    which represents the number of nodes being tracked locally by the
    conductor.
issues:
  - Sensor data notifications to the message bus, such as using the
    ``[metrics]backend`` configuration option of ``collector`` on a dedicated
    API service process or instance, is not presently supported. This
    functionality requires a periodic task to trigger the transmission
    of metrics messages to the message bus notifier.
deprecations:
  - The setting values starting with ``send_sensor`` in the ``[conductor]``
    configuration group have been deprecated and moved to a ``[sensor_data]``
    configuration group. The names have been updated to shorter, operator
    friendly names..
upgrades:
  - Settings starting with ``sensor_data`` in the ``[conductor]``
    configuration group have been moved to a ``[sensor_data]`` configuration
    group amd have been renamed to have shorter value names. If configuration
    values are not updated, the ``oslo.config`` library will emit a warning
    in the logs.
