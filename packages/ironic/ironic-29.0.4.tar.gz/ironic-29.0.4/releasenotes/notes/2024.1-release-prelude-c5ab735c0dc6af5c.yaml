    Ironic contributors are thrilled to present the release of 24.1.0, tested
    as part of OpenStack 2024.1 (Caracal) throughout the last six months. This release can
    be upgraded directly to from Ironic 21.4 as part of a
    `SLURP <https://releases.openstack.org/#releases-with-skip-level-upgrade-release-process-slurp>`_
    upgrade from OpenStack 2023.1 (Antelope).

    Ironic's first release came during the 2014.1 (Icehouse) cycle -- a decade
    ago. In those ten years, redfish has been created, the default deploy driver
    has been replaced, and Ironic has expanded into the CNCF community with
    `Metal3 <https://metal3.io>`_.

    Thanks for making us a part of your cloud!
