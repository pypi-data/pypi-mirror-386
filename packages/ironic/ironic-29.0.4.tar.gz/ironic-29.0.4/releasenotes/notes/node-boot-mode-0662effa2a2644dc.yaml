    Adds ``boot_mode`` and ``secure_boot`` fields to node. These indicate the
    boot mode (bios/uefi) and secure boot state (True/False) detected in the
    most recent power sync or during transition to the ``manageable`` state.
    If underlying driver does not support detecting these, they shall be
    populated with null values.
    These fields are also available under a node's states endpoint:
    ``/v1/nodes/{node_ident}/states``
