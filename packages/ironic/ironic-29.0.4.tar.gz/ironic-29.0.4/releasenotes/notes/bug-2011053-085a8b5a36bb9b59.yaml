    [`bug 2011053 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2011053>`_]
    Fix issue with boot from volume feature. Convert lun field from
    decimal to hexadecimal when generating iscsi url so that ipxe firmware
    could be able to identify the iSCSI SAN URI correctly, according to
    SAN URIs description at https://ipxe.org/sanuri.
