fixes:
  - |
    Fixes the default boot interface order for the ``irmc`` hardware type
    where previously it would prefer ``irmc-pxe`` over ``ipxe``. This
    created inconsistencies for operators using multiple hardware types,
    where both interfaces were enabled in the deployment.
upgrade:
  - |
    Operators who are upgrading should be aware that a bug was discovered
    with the automatic selection of ``boot_interface`` for users of the
    ``irmc`` hardware types. This was an inconsistency, resulting in
    ``irmc-pxe`` being selected instead of ``ipxe`` if these boot
    interfaces were enabled. Depending on the local configuration,
    this may, or may not have happened and will remain static on
    preexisting baremetal nodes. Some users may have been relying upon
    this incorrect behavior by having mis-alligned defaults by trying to
    use the ``irmc-pxe`` interface for ``ipxe``. Users wishing to continue
    this usage as it was previously will need to explicitly set a
    ``boot_interface`` value to either ``pxe`` or ``irmc-pxe``, depending
    on the local configuration. Most operators have leveraged the default
    examples, and thus did not explicitly encounter this condition.
    Operators explicitly wishing to use ``pxe`` boot interfaces with
    the ``ipxe`` templates and defaults set to override the defaults
    for ``ironic.conf`` will need to either continue to leverage default
    override configurations in their ``ironic.conf`` file.
