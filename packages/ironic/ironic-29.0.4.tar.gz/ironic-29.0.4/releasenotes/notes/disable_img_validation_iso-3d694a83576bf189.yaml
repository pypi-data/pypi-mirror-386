    The image format inspection and image safety check have been disabled
    for ISO images cached by Ironic. The feature has been disabled in order
    to fix issues originally described in bug 2091611. On occasion Ironic has
    detected multiple image formats for ISO image that contained GPT, the
    issue originated from the fact that by default the oslo_utils.imageutils
    library handles the GPT partition table format as additional image format
    but allows only 1 image format for each image and throws an error if it
    detects gpt+iso. As the image inspection and safety check was intended to
    fix a security problem related to qemu-img-tools and qcow images, it has
    been decided that the inspection and safety check can be disabled ISO
    images without degrading Ironic's security.
