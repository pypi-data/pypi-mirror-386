    Deprecation warnings for the legacy RBAC policies are now suppressed,
    as the OpenStack community is coalescing around what appears will be a
    longer deprecation cycle and process than would typically be undertaken
    due to the nature and impact of policy changes. The community as a whole
    is expecting to make RBAC policy work changes a community goal during the
    Y* release development cycle, which means the earliest legacy policy
    support may be removed is likely now the Z* development cycle.
