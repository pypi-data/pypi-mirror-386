fixes:
  - |
    While updating boot mode or secure boot state in the Redfish driver,
    the node is now rebooted if the change is not detected on the System
    resource refresh. Ironic then waits up to
    ``[redfish]boot_mode_config_timeout`` seconds until the change is applied.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changing the boot mode or the secure boot state via the direct API
    (``/v1/nodes/{node_ident}/states/boot_mode`` and
    ``/v1/nodes/{node_ident}/states/secure_boot`` accordingly) may now
    result in a reboot. This happens when the change cannot be applied
    immediately. Previously, the change would be applied whenever the next
    reboot happens for any unrelated reason, causing inconsistent behavior.
issues:
  - |
    When boot mode needs to be changed during provisioning, an additional
    reboot may happen on certain hardware. This is to ensure consistent
    behavior when any boot setting change results in a separate internal job.
