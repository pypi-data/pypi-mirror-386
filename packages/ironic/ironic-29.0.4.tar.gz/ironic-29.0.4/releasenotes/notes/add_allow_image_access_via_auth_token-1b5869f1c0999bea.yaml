features:
  - |
    If `allow_image_access_via_auth_token` is set to `True`, Ironic allows access to
    Glance images if an auth_token is present in the request context.
upgrade:
  - |
    In this release, the default value of `allow_image_access_via_auth_token` has been
    changed to `True`. This enables Ironic to access Glance images when an auth token
    is present in the request context.

    This change was backported from the master branch but with a modified default value
    for this stable release. OpenStack integrated operators should ensure images for
    Ironic use are using image visibility "public" or "community" for the most reliable
    results.
deprecation:
  - |
    CONF.allow_image_access_via_auth_token is deprecated, and will be removed,
    along with legacy image access logic, in or after the OpenStack 2026.2 release.
