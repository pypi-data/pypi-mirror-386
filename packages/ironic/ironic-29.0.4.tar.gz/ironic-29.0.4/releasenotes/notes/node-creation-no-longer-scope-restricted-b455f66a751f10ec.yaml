features:
  - |
    Adds the capability for a project scoped ``admin`` user to be able to
    create nodes in Ironic, which are then manageable by the project scoped
    ``admin`` user. Effectively, this is self service Bare Metal as a Service,
    however more advanced fields such as drivers, chassies, are not available
    to these users. This is controlled through an auto-population of the
    Node ``owner`` field, and can be controlled through the
    ``[api]project_admin_can_manage_own_nodes`` setting, which defaults to
    ``True``, and the new policy ``baremetal:node:create:self_owned_node``.
  - |
    Adds the capability for a project scoped ``admin`` user to be able to
    delete nodes from Ironic which their `project` owns. This can be
    controlled through the ``[api]project_admin_can_manage_own_nodes``
    setting, which defaults to ``True``, as well as the
    ``baremetal:node:delete:self_owned_node`` policy.
security:
  - |
    This release contains an improvement which, by default, allows users to
    create and delete baremetal nodes inside their own project. This can be
    disabled using the ``[api]project_admin_can_manage_own_nodes`` setting.
upgrades:
  - |
    The API version has been increased to ``1.80`` in order to signify
    the addition of additional Role Based Access Controls capabilities
    around node creation and deletion.
