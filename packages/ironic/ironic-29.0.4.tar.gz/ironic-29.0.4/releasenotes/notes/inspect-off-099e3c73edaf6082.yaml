fixes:
  - |
    The configuration option ``[inspector]power_off`` is now actually ignored
    for nodes with fast track enabled, as documented in its help.
  - |
    Fixes the built-in in-band inspection implementation to power off the
    node after aborting inspection on user's request, unless the node is
    in the fast track mode or ``[inspector]power_off`` is set to ``False``.
