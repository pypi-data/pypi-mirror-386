    Two statsd metrics names have been modified to provide structural clarity
    and consistency for consumers of statistics metrics. Consumers of metrics
    statistics may need to update their dashboards as the
    ``post_clean_step_hook`` metric is now named
    ``AgentBase.post_clean_step_hook``, and the ``post_deploy_step_hook`` is
    now named ``AgentBase.post_deploy_step_hook``.
