upgrade:
  - |
    In-band cleaning has been fixed for ``ramdisk`` and ``anaconda``
    deploy interfaces. If you rely on actual clean steps not running,
    you need to disable cleaning instead for the relevant nodes::

      baremetal node set <node> --no-automated-clean
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes in-band cleaning for the ``ramdisk`` and ``anaconda`` deploy
    interfaces. Previously no in-band steps were fetched from the ramdisk.
other:
  - |
    The cleaning code has been moved from ``AgentDeployMixin`` to
    ``AgentBaseMixin``. Most of 3rd party deploy interfaces will need to
    include both anyway.
