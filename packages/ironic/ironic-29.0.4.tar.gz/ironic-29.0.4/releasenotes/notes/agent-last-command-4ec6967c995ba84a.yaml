    If the agent accepts a command, but is unable to reply to Ironic (which
    sporadically happens before of the eventlet's TLS implementation), we
    currently retry the request and fail because the command is already
    executing. Ironic now detects this situation by checking the list of
    executing commands after receiving a connection error. If the requested
    command is the last one, we assume that the command request succeeded.
