    Fixes the bug where provisioning a Redfish managed node fails if the BMC
    only supports virtual media devices limited to MediaType of DVD (and not
    CD). Also ddds handling of BadRequest exceptions while iterating through
    the list of virtual media devices. This fix is needed to successfully
    provision machines such as Cisco UCSB and UCSX.
