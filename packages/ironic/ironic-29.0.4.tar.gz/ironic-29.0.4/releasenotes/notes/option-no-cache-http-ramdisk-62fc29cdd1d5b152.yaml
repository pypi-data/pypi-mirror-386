    The behavior when a bootable iso ramdisk is provided behind an http server
    is to download and serve the image from the conductor; the image is
    removed only when the node is undeployed.
    In certain cases, for example on large deployments, this could cause
    undesired behaviors, like the conductor nodes running out of disk
    storage.
    To avoid this event we provide an option
    ``[deploy]ramdisk_image_download_source`` to be able to tell the ramdisk
    interface to directly use the bootable iso url from its original source
    instead of downloading it and serving it from the conductor node.
    The default behavior is unchanged.
