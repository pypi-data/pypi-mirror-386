    Adds support for setting ``disable_power_off`` on node creation along with
    set/unset ``disable_power_off`` on existing nodes.
    If set to ``true``, power off for the node is explicitly disabled, instead, a
    reboot will be used in place of power on/off.  Additionally, when possible,
    the node will be disabled (i.e., its API agent will be rendered unusable
    and network configurationwill be removed) instead of being powered off.
