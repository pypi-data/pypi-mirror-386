deprecations:
  - |
    Use of the console driver ``ipmitool-shellinabox`` has been deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release of Ironic. This decision was reached
    with the reality that the fork of shellinabox appears abandoned with no
    changes in 7 years and open issues to call for the project to hand over
    `maintainership <https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox/issues/531>`_.
