    Adds a ``redfish`` native ``raid_interface`` to the ``redfish`` hardware
    type. See `story 2003514
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2003514>`_ for details.

    Note that common RAID cases have been tested, but cases that are more
    complex or rely on vendor-specific implementation details may not work as
    desired due to capability limitations.
