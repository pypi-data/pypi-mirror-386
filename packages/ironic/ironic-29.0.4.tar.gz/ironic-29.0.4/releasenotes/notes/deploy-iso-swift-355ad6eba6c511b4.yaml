    The configuration option ``[deploy]ramdisk_image_download_source`` now
    supports a new value ``swift``. If set, and if ``boot_iso`` or
    ``deploy_iso`` is a Glance image, the image is exposed via a Swift
    temporary URL. For other types of images the new value works the same
    way as the existing ``http`` value.
