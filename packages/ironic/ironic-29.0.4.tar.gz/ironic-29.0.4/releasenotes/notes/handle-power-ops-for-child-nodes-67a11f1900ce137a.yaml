    Fixes the power handling flow as it relates to ``child nodes``, i.e.
    bare metal nodes which have a ``parent_node`` set, such that power is
    turned off on those nodes when the parent node is powered off, and that
    power is turned on for the parent node when the child node is explicitly
    requested to be in a ``power on`` state. This does not apply if the child
    node device has a dedicated power supply, as indicated through a
    ``driver_info`` parameter named ``has_dedicated_power_supply`` which
    can be set to a value of "true".
