    The set of strings used to detect cipher suite version related errors
    in the ``ipmitool`` command was expanded.
    If the string ``Error in open session response message : invalid role``
    is contained in the output of a failed ``ipmitool`` command execution,
    such error will be now considered as related to inappropriate ciphers too,
    and will be retried with another cipher suite version
    if Ironic is configured to do so.
    See `bug 2085137 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/2085137>`_ for more details.
