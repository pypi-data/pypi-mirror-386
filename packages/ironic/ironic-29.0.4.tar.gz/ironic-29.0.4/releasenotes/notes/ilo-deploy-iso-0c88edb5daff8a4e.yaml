features:
  - |
    The ``ilo-virtual-media`` deploy interface now supports ``file:///`` URLs
    for ``boot_iso`` and ``deploy_iso``.
  - |
    The ``ilo-virtual-media`` deploy interface now supports the
    ``[deploy]ramdisk_image_download_source`` configuration option.
fixes:
  - |
    The ``ilo-virtual-media`` deploy interface no longer requires the Image
    service backend to be Swift for Glance images in ``boot_iso`` and
    ``deploy_iso``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Since ``ilo-virtual-media`` deploy interface now respects the
    ``[deploy]ramdisk_image_download_source`` configuration options, its
    default caching behavior has changed. Now HTTP ``boot_iso``/``deploy_iso``
    are cached locally and served from the conductor's HTTP server instead of
    passing them directly to the BMC. Glance images are also cached locally.
    To revert to the previous behavior, set the
    ``[deploy]ramdisk_image_download_source`` option to ``swift``.
