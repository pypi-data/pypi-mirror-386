    Adds a default ``project`` scoped ``manager`` role to the RBAC model.
    In the ironic model, access is generally explicitly delegated, and such
    the ``manager`` role is presently equivalent to project scoped ``admin``
    role, however future delineation may occur as the new features and
    capabilities are added.
