    Fixes an issue where the database upgrade can hang on Python 3.10.
    This was because open transactions could become orphaned awaiting
    the Python runtime to clean up their memory references due to the
    way the overall database query was being intiiated to pre-flight
    check the upgrade. We have structurally changed the behavior
    to remedy this case.
