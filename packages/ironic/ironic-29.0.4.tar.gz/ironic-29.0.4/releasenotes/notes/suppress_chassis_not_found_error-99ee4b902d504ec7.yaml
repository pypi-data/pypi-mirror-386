    Fixes an issue where an API user, when requesting a node list or single
    node object, could get an error indicating that the request was bad as
    the chassis was not found. This can occur when in-flight delete
    operations are in progress on another thread. Instead of surfacing a
    request breaking error, the API now suppresses the error and just
    treats it as if there is no Chassis.
