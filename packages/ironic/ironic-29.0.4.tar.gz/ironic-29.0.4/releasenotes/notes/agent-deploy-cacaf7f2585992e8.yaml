upgrade:
  - |
    Because of the code reorganization, some metrics have been removed: all
    metrics prefixed with ``AgentDeployMixin`` are now prefixed with
    ``CustomAgentDeploy`` or ``AgentDeploy`` instead.
other:
  - |
    The ``AgentDeployMixin`` class has been removed from ``agent_base.py``.
    Third-party deploy interfaces that inherit it most probably want to
    inherit ``ironic.drivers.modules.agent.CustomAgentDeploy`` instead.

    If you rely on the ``prepare_instance_to_boot`` or ``configure_local_boot``
    helper methods, inherit from ``AgentDeploy`` instead.
