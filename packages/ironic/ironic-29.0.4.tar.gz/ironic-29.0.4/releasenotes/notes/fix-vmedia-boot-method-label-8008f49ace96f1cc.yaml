    Fixes an issue where ironic was not properly labeling dynamically built
    virtual media ramdisks with the signifier flag so the ramdisk understands
    it was booted from virtual media.

    Fixes the missing ``boot_method`` ramdisk parameter for dynamically build
    virtual media payloads. This value must be set to ``vmedia`` for the
    ramdisk running on virtual media to understand it is executing from
    virtual media. This was fixed for cases where it is used with the
    ``redfish-virtual-media`` based boot interfaces as well as the
    ``ilo-virtual-media`` boot interface, which is where dynamic virtual media
    deployment/cleaning ramdisk generation is supported.
