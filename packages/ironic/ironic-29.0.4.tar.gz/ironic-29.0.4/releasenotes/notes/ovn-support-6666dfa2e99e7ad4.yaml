    While Ironic has not explicitly added support for OVN, because that is
    in theory a Neutron implementation detail, we have added some basic
    testing and are pleased to announce that you can use OVN's DHCP service
    for IPv4 based provisioning with OVN v23.06.00 and beyond. This is not
    without issues, and we've added
    `ovn documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/ovn-networking.html>`_
    as a result to help provide as much Ironic operator clarity as possible.
issues:
  - |
    Use of OVN may require disabling SNAT for provisioning with IPv4 when
    using TFTP. This is due to the Linux Kernel, and how IP packet handling
    occurs with OVN. No solution is known to this issue, and use of
    provisioning technologies which do *not* use TFTP is also advisable.
  - |
    Use of OVN may require careful attention to the MTUs of networks.
    Oversized packets and networking may be dropped. That being said this
    is more likely an issue for testing than with actual physical baremetal
    in a production deployment.
  - |
    Use of OVN for IPv6 based PXE/iPXE is not supported by Neutron.
    The Ironic project expects this to be addressed during the Caracal
    (2024.1) development cycle.
