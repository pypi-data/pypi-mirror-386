    IPv6 testing in the upstream Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines has
    been removed. This was the result of the move to UEFI booting in general,
    combined with the the state of the EDK2 virtual machine firmware which
    is known to have
    `many issues with IPv6 <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20ipv6>`_,
    and thus cannot be tested in an automated fashion upstream.
    Previously Ironic tested IPv6 utilizing BIOS boot, but recent move to
    leverage Ubuntu Noble in upstream CI also limited the community's
    options as the BIOS ROM firmware images no longer contain IPv6 support.

    As a result of this, we are forced to remove the CI job from testing.

    We hope to restore this testing at some point in the future, should
    EDK2 fix some of the known issues. This issue does not impact support
    for physical machines which has long been validated as known working
    through operator reports and downstream vendor testing activities.
