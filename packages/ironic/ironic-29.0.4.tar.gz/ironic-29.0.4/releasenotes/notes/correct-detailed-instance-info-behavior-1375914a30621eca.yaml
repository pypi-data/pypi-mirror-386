    Fixes an issue with the ``/v1/nodes/detail`` endpoint where an
    authenticated user could explicitly ask for an ``instance_uuid`` lookup
    and the associated node would be returned to the user with sensitive
    fields redacted in the result payload if the user did not explicitly have
    ``owner`` or ``lessee`` permissions over the node. This is considered a
    low-impact low-risk issue as it requires the API consumer to already know
    the UUID value of the associated instance, and the returned information
    is mainly metadata in nature. More information can be found in
    `Storyboard story 2008976 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2008976>`_.

    Fixes an issue with the ``/v1/nodes/detail`` endpoint where requests
    for an explicit ``instance_uuid`` match would not follow the standard
    query handling path and thus not be filtered based on policy determined
    access level and node level ``owner`` or ``lessee`` fields appropriately.
