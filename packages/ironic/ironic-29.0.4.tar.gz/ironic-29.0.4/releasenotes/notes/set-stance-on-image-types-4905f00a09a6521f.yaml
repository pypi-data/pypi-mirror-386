    Moving forward, Ironic will discourage the use of "partition" images,
    in favor of "whole disk images", largely due to the underlying complexity
    in the code to maintain partition image support. This is not the
    deprecation of the functionality as the community has agreed to keep the
    functionality and fix any issues we become aware of. UEFI Partition images,
    where EFI assets are copied from a partition image, are the only partition
    images Ironic intends to test on a regular basis moving forward.
