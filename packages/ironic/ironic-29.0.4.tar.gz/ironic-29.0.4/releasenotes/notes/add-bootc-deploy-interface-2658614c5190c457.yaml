    Adds a ``bootc`` deploy interface which can be enabled by an Ironic
    deployment administrator, which can then enable users of the ``bootc``
    deploy interface to have a streamlined path for the deployment of
    bootc supporting container images to a host directly,
    without additional intermediate steps. More information about
    bootc can be found on the
    `bootc website <https://containers.github.io/bootc/>`_.
