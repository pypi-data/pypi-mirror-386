    Fixes an issue when listing allocations as a project scoped user when
    the legacy RBAC policies have been disabled which forced an HTTP 406
    error being erroneously raised. Users attempting to list allocations
    with a specific owner, different from their own, will now receive
    an HTTP 403 error.
