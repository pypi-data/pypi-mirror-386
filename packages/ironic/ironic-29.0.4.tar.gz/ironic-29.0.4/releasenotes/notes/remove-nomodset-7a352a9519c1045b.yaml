    The defaults for ``kernel_append_params`` have had the Linux kernel
    command line parameter ``nomodeset`` removed from the defaults for the
    ``kernel_append_params`` settings. The ``nomodeset`` option is for
    troubleshooting and changes the behavior of the graphics interface
    such that memory can be locked upon graphical updates on physical
    servers with BMC graphical interfaces, which results in spikes in
    latency and packet loss whenever graphics updates occur. Operators
    may add the option to their local configuration, but should be aware
    that large image transfers or other high IO operations can be impacted.

    Agents deploying on physical servers with default kernel arguments were
    suspetible to packet loss if a Matrox VGA/Aspeed BMC Graphics interface
    is present on the machine. The defaults have been changed to remove
    the use of the ``nomodeset`` kernel command line parameter which
    should only be used for troubleshooting as it has been determined
    that the memory updates can lock all of the kernel memory upon any
    console graphics update which can negatively impact IO for Networking
    or Disk interactions.
