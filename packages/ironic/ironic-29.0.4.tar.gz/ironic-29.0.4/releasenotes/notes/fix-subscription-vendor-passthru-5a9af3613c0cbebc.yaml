    The validation for ``create_subscription`` now uses the default values
    from Redfish for `Context` and `Protocol` to avoid `None`.
    The fields returned by ``create_subscription`` and ``get_subscription``
    are now filtered by the common fields between vendors.
    Deleting a subscription that doesn't exist will return 404 instead of 500.
