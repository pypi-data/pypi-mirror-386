    The API version of the Bare Metal API provided by the ``ironic-api``
    service has been incremented to ``1.71`` to signify that the API supports
    System and Project scoped Role Based Access Controls, which is purely
    informational in nature, as the version itself cannot be used to change
    the API behavior for access controls. In excess of 1500 unit tests were
    added as part of the effort to implement Role Based Access Controls to
    help ensure the effort did not break the API behavior.
