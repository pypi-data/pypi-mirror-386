    Methods in vendor interfaces may now be decroated with ``clean_step`` and
    ``deploy_step`` decorators.

    The ``ipmitool`` vendor interface's ``send_raw`` method can now be called
    as a part of cleaning or deployment steps with an "raw_bytes" argument
    matching how it can be called with the vendor passthru interface.
other:
  - |
    The ``ipmitool`` vendor passthrough interface method no longer requires a
    ``http_method`` parameter. This is optional in the code base, but included
    on all API initiated vendor passthru method calls.
    The value was not utilized.
