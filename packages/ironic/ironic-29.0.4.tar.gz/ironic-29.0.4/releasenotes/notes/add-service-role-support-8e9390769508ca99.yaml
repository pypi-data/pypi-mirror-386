    Adds support for the ``service`` role, which is intended for service to
    service communication, such as for those where ``ironic-inspector``,
    ``nova-compute``, or ``networking-baremetal`` needs to communicate with
    Ironic's API.
upgrade:

    Ironic now has support for the ``service`` role, which is available in the
    ``system`` scope as well as the ``project`` scope. This functionality
    is for service to service communication, if desired. Effective access rights
    are similar to the ``manager`` or the ``owner`` scoped admin privileges.
