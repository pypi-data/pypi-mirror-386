    There are now configurable random wait times for fake drivers in a new
    ironic.conf [fake] section. Each supported driver having one configuration
    option controlling the delay. These delays are applied to operations which
    typically block in other drivers. This allows more realistic scenarios to
    be arranged for performance and functional testing of ironic itself.
