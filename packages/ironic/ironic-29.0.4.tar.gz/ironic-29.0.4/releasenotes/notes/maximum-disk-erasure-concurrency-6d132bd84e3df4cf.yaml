    The maximum disk erasure concurrency setting,
    ``[deploy]disk_erasure_concurrency`` has been incremed to 4.
    Previously, this was kept at 1 in order to maintain continuity of
    experience, but operators have not reported any issues with an increased
    concurrency, and as such we feel comfortable upstream enabling concurrent
    disk erasure/cleaning. This setting applies to the ``erase_devices`` clean
    step.
