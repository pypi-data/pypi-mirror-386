    Adds inspection hooks in the agent inspect interface for processing data
    received from the ramdisk at the /v1/continue_inspection endpoint. The
    four default configuration hooks `ramdisk-error`, `validate-interfaces`,
    `ports` and `architecture` are added. Two new configuration options
    `default_hooks` and `hooks` are added in the `inspector` configuration
    section to allow configuring the default enabled hooks and optional
    additional hooks, respectively.
