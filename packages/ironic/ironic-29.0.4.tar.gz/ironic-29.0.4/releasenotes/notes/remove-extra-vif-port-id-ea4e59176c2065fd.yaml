    The functionality of using a port.extra ``vif_port_id``
    value to signal and control a VIF attachment has been removed
    to support changing the permission model and access control policy.
    Use of ``vif_port_id`` outside of the VIF attachment/detachment workflow
    has been deprecated since the Ocata development cycle.
