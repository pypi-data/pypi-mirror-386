    Fixes an missing MySQL/MariaDB character set configuration and default
    table type encoding for the ``allocations`` database table. Previously,
    If Ironic's database was attempted to be populated on a machine which
    was using 4 byte character encoding, such as MySQL/MariaDB on Debian
    based systems, then the database schema creation would fail.
upgrade:
  - This upgrade updates the default character set to utilized in the
    database tables when using MySQL/MariaDB. Previously, the default
    for Ironic was ``UTF8``, however we now explicitly set ``UTF8MB3``
    which is short for "3 byte UTF8" encoding. The exception to this
    is the ``allocations`` table, which would just rely upon the database
    default. This was done as Ironic's database schema is incompatible
    with MySQL/MariaDB's ``UTF8MB4``, or "4 byte UTF8" character encoding
    and storage constraints.
  - Upgrading will change the default character encoding of all tables.
    For most tables, this should be an effective noop, but may result in
    transitory table locks. For the ``allocations`` table, it will need to
    be re-written, during which the database engine will have locked the
    table from being used. Operators are advised to perform test upgrades
    and set expectation and upgrade plans accordingly.
