    Sending signal ``SIGUSR2`` to a conductor process will now trigger a drain
    shutdown. This is similar to a ``SIGTERM`` graceful shutdown but the timeout
    is determined by ``[DEFAULT]drain_shutdown_timeout`` which defaults to
    ``1800`` seconds. This is enough time for running tasks on existing reserved
    nodes to either complete or reach their own failure timeout.

    During the drain period the conductor will be removed from the hash ring to
    prevent new tasks from starting. Other conductors will no longer fail
    reserved nodes on the draining conductor, which previously appeared to be
    orphaned. This is achieved by running the conductor keepalive heartbeat for
    this period, but setting the ``online`` state to ``False``.
