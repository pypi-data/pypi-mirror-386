    A new entry point ``ironic.console.container`` is added to determine how
    console containers are orchestrated when ``ironic.conf``
    ``[vnc]enabled=True``. By default the ``fake`` provider is specified by
    ``[vnc]container_provider`` which performs no orchestration. The only
    functional implementation included is ``systemd`` which manages containers
    as Systemd Quadlet containers. These containers run as user services and
    rootless podman containers. Having ``podman`` installed is also a
    dependency for this provider. See ``ironic.conf`` ``[vnc]`` options
    to see how this provider can be configured.

    The ``systemd`` provider is opinionated and will not be appropriate for
    some Ironic deployment methods, especially those which run Ironic inside
    containers. External implementations of ``ironic.console.container`` are
    encouraged to integrate with other deployment / management methods.
