    The anaconda deploy interface now handles config drive. The config drive
    contents are written to the disk in the /var/lib/cloud/seed/config_drive
    directory by the driver via kickstart files %post section. cloud-init
    picks up the the config drive information and processes them.
    Because the config drive is extracted on to disk as plain text files,
    tools like glean do not work with this deploy interface.
