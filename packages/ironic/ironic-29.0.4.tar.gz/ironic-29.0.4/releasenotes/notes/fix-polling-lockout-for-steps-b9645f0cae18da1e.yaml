    Fixes an issue where operators executing complex arrangement of steps
    which include out-of-band and in-band steps, for example a hardware
    RAID ``create_configuration`` step followed by in-band steps inside of
    the agent, would effectively get the agent stuck in a ``wait`` state in
    the Cleaning, Servicing, or Deploying workflows.
    This was related to the way out-of-band steps are executed and monitored.
    Ironic, before starting to execute a new step, now cleans the polling
    lockout flag for the respective workflow being executed to prevent the
    agent from getting stuck. For more information, please see
    `bug 2096938 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2096938>`_.
