    Adds a ``clean hold`` and a ``deploy hold`` provision state in which
    baremetal nodes can be put in utilizing specialed ``hold`` cleaning
    and deployment steps. Allowing for patterns and processes where
    Ironic's work is intentionally paused to allow for any external or
    operator processes to take place. In these new states, a ``unhold``
    provision state verb can be used to inform Ironic to proceed.
    The ``abort`` verb is also a possible option should operators wish
    to start over.
