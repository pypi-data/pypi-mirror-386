features:
  - |
    Make the ``idrac`` hardware type inherit from the ``redfish`` hardware
    type since the ``idrac`` hardware type is an extension of the ``redfish``
    with Dell specific overrides. This will ensure that features available
    to the ``redfish`` hardware type will always be available to ``idrac``.
    Added ``redfish`` interface as available for the ``bios``, ``power``
    and ``vendor`` interfaces of the ``idrac`` hardware type.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecates the ``idrac-redfish`` interfaces in favor of the ``redfish``
    interfaces for the ``bios``, ``power``, and ``vendor`` interfaces. This
    is a no-op change as these interfaces wrapped the ``redfish`` interface
    with no change already.
