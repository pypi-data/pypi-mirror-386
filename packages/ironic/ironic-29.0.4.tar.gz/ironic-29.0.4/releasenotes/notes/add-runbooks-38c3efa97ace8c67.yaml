  - |
    Adds a new API concept, runbooks, to enable self-service of maintenance
    items on nodes by project members.

    Runbooks are curated lists of steps that can be run on nodes only
    associated via traits and used in lieu of an explicit list of steps
    for manual cleaning or servicing.
  - |
    Adds a new top-level REST API endpoint `/v1/runbooks/` with basic CRUD
    support.
  - |
    Extends the `/v1/nodes/<node>/states/provision` API to accept a runbook
    ident (name or UUID) instead of `clean_steps` or `service_steps` for
    servicing or manual cleaning.
  - |
    Implements RBAC-aware lifecycle management for runbooks, allowing projects
    to limit who can CRUD and use a runbook.
