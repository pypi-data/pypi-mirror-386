    Adds the capability for Ironic's conductor to detect Zstandard
    compressed content and to automatically decompress the files
    to enable image format detection and conversion.

    This is due to use of Zstandard compression upon artifacts stored
    in container registries is a popular practice, and can be disabled
    using the ``[conductor]disable_zstandard_decompression``
    configuration option.
