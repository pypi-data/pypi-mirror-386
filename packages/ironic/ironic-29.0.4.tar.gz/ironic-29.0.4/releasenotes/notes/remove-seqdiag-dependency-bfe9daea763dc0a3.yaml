upgrade:
  - Removes the sphinxcontrib-seqdiag dependency as the Pillow upgrade to
    version 10.x (from OpenStack upper constraints) breaks its usage. seqdiag
    has not been maintained for the last 3 years, hence the upgrade causes it
    to break.
    In the ironic docs (source) rst files, adds references to svg files, and
    keeps the svg files in the doc/source/images/ directory, alongside their
    associated .diag files as backup.
