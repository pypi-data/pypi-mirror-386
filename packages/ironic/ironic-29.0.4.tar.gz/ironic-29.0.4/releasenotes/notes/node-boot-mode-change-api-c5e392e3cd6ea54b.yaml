    Adds endpoints to change boot mode and secure boot state of node.

    * ``PUT /v1/nodes/{node_ident}/states/boot_mode``
    * ``PUT /v1/nodes/{node_ident}/states/secure_boot``

    The API will respond with 202 (Accepted) on validating the request
    and accepting to process it. Changes occur asynchronously in a
    background task. The user can then poll the states endpoint
    ``/v1/nodes/{node_ident}/states`` for observing current status of the
    requested change.
