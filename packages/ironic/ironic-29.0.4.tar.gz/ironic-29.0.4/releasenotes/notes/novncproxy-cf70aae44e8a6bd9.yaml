features:
  - |
    A new service ``ironic-novncproxy`` has been added which allows the
    graphical console of a host to be presented in a NoVNC web browser
    interface. Hosts required a supported ``console`` driver to access its
    graphical console.

    If graphical console support is required, the ``ironic-novncproxy`` service
    needs to be started and managed. Graphical console specific options need
    to be set in the ``[vnc]`` section of ``ironic.conf``.
