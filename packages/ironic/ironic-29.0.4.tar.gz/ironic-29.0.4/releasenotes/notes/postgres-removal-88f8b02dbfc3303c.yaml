upgrade:
  - |
    Deployers using PostgreSQL must migrate to a supported mysql-compatible
    database, such as MySQL or MariaDB.
deprecations:
  - |
    Use of postgresql has been deprecated for all OpenStack projects,
    including ironic, for several years. However, in an effort to avoid
    breaking existing installs, we had tested database migrations and
    performed a basic functionality test against PostgreSQL. This test has
    now been removed, and operators deployed on PostgreSQL must migrate to
    a MySQL-compatible database, such as MySQL or MariaDB, before upgrade.
