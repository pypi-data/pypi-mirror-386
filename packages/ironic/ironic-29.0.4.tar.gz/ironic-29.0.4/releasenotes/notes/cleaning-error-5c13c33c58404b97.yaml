fixes:
  - |
    When aborting cleaning, the ``last_error`` field is no longer initially
    empty. It is now populated on the state transition to ``clean failed``.
  - |
    When cleaning or deployment fails, the ``last_error`` field is no longer
    temporary set to ``None`` while the power off action is running.
