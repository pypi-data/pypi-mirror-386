    No longer falls back to `unmanaged` inspection for virtual media and
    UEFI HTTP boot interfaces. Previously, if the validation of the boot
    interface failed before in-band inspection, Ironic would switch to
    unmanaged inspection, which involved PXE-booting. It is not expected
    that nodes explicitly configured to use virtual media start booting
    over PXE, so the fallback has been removed.
