    Add ``anaconda`` deploy interface to Ironic. This driver will deploy
    the OS using anaconda installer and kickstart file instead of IPA. To
    support this feature a new configuration group ``anaconda`` is added to
    Ironic configuration file along with ``default_ks_template`` configuration
    option.

    The deploy interface uses heartbeat API to communicate. The kickstart
    template must include %pre %post %onerror and %traceback sections that
    should send status of the deployment back to Ironic API using heartbeats.
    An example of such calls to heartbeat API can be found in the default
    kickstart template. To enable anaconda to send status back to Ironic API
    via heartbeat ``agent_status`` and ``agent_status_message`` are added to
    the heartbeat API. Use of these new parameters require API microversion
    1.72 or greater.
