    Adds basic support for managing RAID configuration via the Redfish
    out-of-band (OOB) management protocol to the ``idrac`` hardware type by
    adding new interface named ``idrac-redfish``. For this iDRAC firmware
    greater than 4.40.00.00 is required. The ``idrac`` hardware type now
    supports ``idrac-wsman``, ``idrac``, ``idrac-redfish``, and ``no-raid``
    interfaces in given priority order.
