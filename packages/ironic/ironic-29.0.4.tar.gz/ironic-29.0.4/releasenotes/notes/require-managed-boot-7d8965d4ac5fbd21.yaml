    The default value of the ``[inspector]require_managed_boot`` option will
    change from ``False`` to ``True`` in the future, causing in-band inspection
    to fail if the boot interface cannot prepare the ramdisk boot (e.g. in case
    of missing ports). Please set this option to an explicit value to avoid
    the behavior change.
