upgrade:
  - |
    Adds an online migration to the `new inspection interface
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/inspection/index.html>`_.
    If the ``agent`` inspection is enabled and the ``inspector`` inspection is
    disabled, the ``inspect_interface`` field will be updated for all nodes
    that use ``inspector`` and are currently not on inspection (i.e. not in the
    ``inspect wait`` or ``inspecting`` states).

    If some nodes may be inspecting during the upgrade, you may want to run
    the online migrations several times with a delay to finish migrating all
    nodes.
