    The Ironic team hereby announces the release of the `Zed` version of
    Ironic. This version, *21.1.0*, represents the collaboration of Ironic's
    contributors during the `Zed` release cycle, which first saw the release
    of Ironic *20.2.0*, and Ironic *21.1.0*. These versions saw improvements
    in functionality to better support infrastructure operators from the
    configuration of individual nodes, to support a greater separation
    of duties, and ultimately Self-Service Bare Metal as a Service, or
    "SSBMaaS". Along with these features, these releases have seen numerous
    bug fixes. We sincerely hope you enjoy it!
