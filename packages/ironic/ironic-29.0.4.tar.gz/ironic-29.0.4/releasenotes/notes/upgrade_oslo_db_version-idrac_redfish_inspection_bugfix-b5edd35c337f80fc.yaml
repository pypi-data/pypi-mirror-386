    Fixes issue arose during inspection of iDRAC node with inspect-interface
    as idrac-redfish. Earlier, inspection of node was getting failed with
    error ``port already exists``.
    This issue arose since MySQL 8.0.19 where duplicate key error
    information is extended to include the table name in the key. Previously,
    duplicate key error information included only the key value and key name.
