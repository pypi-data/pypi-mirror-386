    Fixes bug in iRMC driver, where `irmc` power_interface sets and updates
    `irmc_ipmi_succeed` flag which is used by rest of iRMC driver code to deal
    with iRMC firmware's IPMI incompatibility but `ipmitool` power_interface
    doesn't set nor update `irmc_ipmi_succeed` flag and rest of iRMC driver
    code fail to handle iRMC firmware's IPMI incompatibility correctly.
