    Previously the ``conductors`` ``online`` database column is not considered
    when displaying the "baremetal conductor list" ``Alive`` status. This means
    that when a conductor is stopped gracefully it will be shown as
    (inaccurately) alive for the duration of ``[conductor]heartbeat_timeout``.

    A conductor is now considered alive if ``online`` is true and there is a
    recent enough heartbeat.
