# Hyperliquid MCP Configuration
# 
# ⚠️  DEPRECATED: This .env file is no longer used!
# 
# Environment variables are now configured directly in your MCP client settings.
# See README.md for configuration instructions.
#
# For Claude Desktop / Kiro, add to your mcp.json:
# {
#   "mcpServers": {
#     "hyperliquid": {
#       "command": "uvx",
#       "args": ["hyperliquid-mcp"],
#       "env": {
#         "HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
#         "HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET": "false"
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# REQUIRED: Your private key for signing transactions
# This should be the private key of a wallet that is registered on Hyperliquid
HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234567890abcdef...

# OPTIONAL: Account address (if using agent/API wallet mode)
# If not set, will use the address derived from HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY
# Set this if your signing wallet is different from your trading account
# HYPERLIQUID_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=0xYourTradingAccountAddress...

# OPTIONAL: Use testnet instead of mainnet
# Set to 'true' for testnet, 'false' or unset for mainnet
HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET=false

# OPTIONAL: Vault address (if trading from a vault)
# HYPERLIQUID_VAULT_ADDRESS=0xVaultAddress...

# NOTES:
# 1. Your wallet MUST be registered on Hyperliquid before trading
#    - Go to https://app.hyperliquid.xyz (or testnet URL)
#    - Connect wallet and deposit funds from Arbitrum
#    - This registers your wallet in Hyperliquid's system
#
# 2. Keep your private key secure and never commit it to version control
#
# 3. For agent mode:
#    - HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY = API wallet that signs transactions
#    - HYPERLIQUID_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS = Main account that owns positions
