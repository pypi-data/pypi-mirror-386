# Data to Support the Development of Rapid GC-MS Methods for Seized Drug Analysis

This dataset contains raw datafiles that support the development of rapid gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods for seized drug analysis. Files are provided in the native ".D" format collected from an Agilent GC-MS system. Files can be opened using Agilent proprietary software or freely available software such as AMDIS (which can be downloaded at chemdata.nist.gov). Included here is data of seized drug mixtures and adjudicated case samples that were analyzed as part of the method development process for rapid GC-MS. Information about the naming of datafiles and the contents of each mixture and case sample can be found in the associated Excel sheet ("File Names and Comments.xlsx").
