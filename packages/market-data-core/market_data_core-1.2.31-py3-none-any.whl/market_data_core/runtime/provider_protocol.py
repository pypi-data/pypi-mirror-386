class Provider(Protocol):
    """Protocol for provider adapters.

    All provider implementations must adhere to this protocol.
    The protocol defines the contract for fetching market data in both
    live and backfill modes.

    Attributes:
        name: Provider instance name (matches config key)

    Methods:
        fetch_live: Fetch current/recent data for a dataset
        backfill: Fetch historical data according to backfill spec

    Note:
        Implementations should:
        - Respect provider budgets and pacing
        - Honor retry policies
        - Yield bars incrementally (don't buffer everything)
        - Log errors but don't crash on partial failures
        - Support idempotent replays (same input → same output)

    Example:
        ```python
        class MyAdapter:
            def __init__(self, name: str, cfg: Any):
                self.name = name
                # Initialize connection, etc.

            def fetch_live(self, dataset: Any, job: Any) -> Iterable[Bar]:
                # Fetch latest bars
                yield Bar(...)

            def backfill(self, dataset: Any, job: Any) -> Iterable[Bar]:
