ensure_headless_chromium
Ensure Playwright's Chromium browser is installed and usable.

Strategy:
1. Try to launch Chromium headless via Playwright's Python API.
   - If it works, we're done.
   - If it fails with a "browser not found" style error, try to install.
2. Install attempt prefers `uv run playwright install chromium`,
   then falls back to `sys.executable -m playwright install chromium`.

Intended to be called from other xgid2anki modules;
logging is configured in the main CLI.
