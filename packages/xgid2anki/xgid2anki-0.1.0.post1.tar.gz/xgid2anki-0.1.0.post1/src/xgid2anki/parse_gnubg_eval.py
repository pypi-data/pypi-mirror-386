xgid2anki.parse_gnubg_eval
--------------------------

Parse and normalize GNUBG evaluation output into structured Python data.

This module reads the JSON objects emitted by the GNUBG-side script
(:mod:`xgid2anki.gnubg_pos_analysis`) and extracts the key information
needed to build flashcardsâ€”typically equities, best moves, cube decisions,
and other metadata relevant for study.

Responsibilities:
  1. Validate and normalize the raw analysis structure from GNUBG.
  2. Convert strings and numeric fields into consistent Python types.
  3. Return a list of dictionaries, one per analyzed XGID.

Intended to be called from :func:`xgid2anki.pipeline.xgid2anki_pipeline`;
it performs no I/O beyond reading the in-memory GNUBG results.
