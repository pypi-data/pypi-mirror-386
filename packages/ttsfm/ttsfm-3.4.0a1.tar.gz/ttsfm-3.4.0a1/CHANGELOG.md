## [3.3.2-3.3.7] - 2025-10-21

fixes and improvements since 3.3.1

## [3.3.1] - 2025-10-18

### Changed
- Enforced a 1000-character ceiling across the core clients, CLI, and web API, with sentence-aware splitting that falls back to word chunks when required.
- Refreshed the README (EN/ZH), translations, and UI badges to document the new limit and updated release version.
- Bundled `ffmpeg` inside the runtime Docker image so MP3 auto-combine succeeds out of the box without manual package installs.

### Testing
- `pytest`
- Manual `/v1/audio/speech` request (‚âà1.6k chars) exercised Docker auto-combine; returned `X-Chunks-Combined: 2` and a playable MP3.

## [3.3.0-alpha5] - 2025-09-19

### Fixed
- Restored lint compliance across the repo (flake8, import hygiene, line wrapping) so the release pipeline can publish successfully.
- Hardened Docker smoke test to manage container lifecycle and surface logs when health checks fail.
- Ensured Eventlet monkey patching happens before Flask imports to stop recursion-depth crashes and restore HTTP endpoint health.
- Forced long-text auto-combine flows to request WAV when MP3 would require `ffmpeg`, avoiding runtime errors on stock deployments.

### Documentation
- Updated release notes to point to the `alpha5` build.

## [3.3.0-alpha4] - 2025-09-19

### Changed
- Enforced MP3 pass-through while mapping all other requested formats to WAV so the service returns predictable audio without failing compatibility checks.
- Python clients now normalise outbound `response_format` payloads to the supported set and surface fallback metadata when a WAV result is returned.
- Docker build workflow tags only `v*` image aliases to avoid duplicate semver tags without the `v` prefix.

### Removed
- Web playground and WebSocket demo no longer expose manual format selectors, reducing confusion around unavoidable WAV fallbacks.

### Documentation
- README (EN/ZH) clarifies the MP3-only guarantee and WAV fallback, and the UI copy was refreshed accordingly.

## [3.3.0-alpha3] - 2025-09-18

### Added
- Centralised audio chunk combining in `ttsfm/audio.py`, including the reusable `combine_responses` helper for both core and web flows.
- `auto_combine=True` support in the synchronous/asynchronous clients and CLI delivers a single audio file for long text (pydub still optional for non-WAV output).
- Regression tests (`tests/test_clients.py`) covering the new combination paths.

### Changed
- Long-text splitting now falls back to word-level chunks with a small tolerance so punctuation stays intact while respecting `max_length` limits.

### Documentation
- README (EN/ZH) highlights the Python auto-combine option and CLI flag; `AI_NOTES.md` captures the refreshed test instructions.

### Testing
- Added regression coverage for the audio helper refactor and client auto-combine behaviour; `pytest` commands documented for follow-up runs.

## [3.3.0-alpha2] - 2025-09-18

### Changed
- Non-WAV audio combining now passes explicit decoder hints so OPUS/AAC/FLAC/PCM chunks merge correctly in the web stack.
- WebSocket streaming tasks close their per-request `TTSClient` once finished, preventing open `requests.Session` handles from accumulating.
- Sentence splitting falls back to word-level chunks (with a small tolerance to keep punctuation) ensuring every generated request respects `max_length`.

### Documentation
- Clarified in README (EN/ZH) that automatic long-text combining is provided by the Docker/OpenAI-compatible API, not the core Python client.

### Testing
- Added regression tests for the enhanced text splitting and audio combiner behaviour and documented run commands in `AI_NOTES.md`.

## [3.3.0-alpha] - 2025-09-17

### Added
- Flask web app now spins up per-request TTS clients, streams responses, hashes API keys, and enforces simple rate limits.
- WebSocket handler tracks active tasks, supports cancellation, and streams base64 audio chunks for responsive UIs.
- Frontend metadata fetches use a cached API client, and CI now runs lint/test gates before packaging artifacts.

### Changed
- Deterministic HTTP header generation no longer depends on network user-agent lookups.
- Default narration prompts are opt-in for both sync and async clients, and retry logic preserves original exceptions.
- Audio combining requires "pydub" for non-WAV formats and fails fast when the dependency is missing.

### Fixed
- Async client retry payload handling copies request bodies per attempt to avoid mutation side effects.

## [3.2.9] - 2025-09-16

### Container build
- Replaced the Docker image with a multi-stage build that installs dependencies in a throwaway stage and keeps only the runtime layers.
- Taught the entrypoint build to accept a VERSION build argument so tagged releases surface the correct version without bundling .git metadata.
- Added a .dockerignore that drops virtualenvs, docs, tests, and lock artifacts from the build context for faster, smaller builds.

### Continuous integration
- Extended the Docker workflow to run on pushes and pull requests so image regressions surface before releases.
- Simplified release pushes by skipping image size enforcement while keeping multi-arch publishing for tagged releases.

### Web playground
- Rebuilt the playground controller so validation, random prompts, reset, and share/download buttons behave again.
- Restored audio metadata reporting (duration, size, format, voice, timestamps) and added richer streaming progress indicators.

## [3.2.8] - 2025-09-16

### üê≥ Docker Reliability Improvements

- Containers now bind to `0.0.0.0` by default when running under Docker, resolving WebSocket startup loops and HTTP 502 errors when exposing port 8000.
- Health endpoints and UI badges report the correct v3.2.8 identifier so deployments reflect the running build instantly.

### üìò Documentation & Release Prep

- README (EN/ZH) updated with guidance for overriding the bind host via the `HOST` environment variable.
- Package metadata, translations, and distribution manifests bumped for the v3.2.8 Python and container releases.
