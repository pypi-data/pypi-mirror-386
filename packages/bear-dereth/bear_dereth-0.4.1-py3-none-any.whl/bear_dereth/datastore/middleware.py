        Usually a user creates a new instance like this::

            BearDB(storage=StorageClass)

        The storage keyword argument is used by BearDB this way::

            self.storage = storage(*args, **kwargs)

        As we can see, ``storage(...)`` runs the constructor and returns the
        new storage instance.


        Using Middlewares, the user will call::

                                       The 'real' storage class
                                       v

                       ^
                       Already an instance!

        So, when running ``self.storage = storage(*args, **kwargs)`` Python
        now will call ``__call__`` and BearDB will expect the return value to
        be the storage (or Middleware) instance. Returning the instance is
        simple, but we also got the underlying (*real*) StorageClass as an
        __init__ argument that still is not an instance.
        So, we initialize it in __call__ forwarding any arguments we receive
        from BearDB (``BearDB(arg1, kwarg1=value, storage=...)``).

        In case of nested Middlewares, calling the instance as if it was a
        class results in calling ``__call__`` what initializes the next
        nested Middleware that itself will initialize the next Middleware and
        so on.
