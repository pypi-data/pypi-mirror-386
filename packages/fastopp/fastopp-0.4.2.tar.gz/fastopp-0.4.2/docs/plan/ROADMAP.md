# FastOpp Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development timeline, student recruitment plans, and strategic direction for the FastOpp platform.

## Project Overview

FastOpp is designed for developers to assess FastAPI functionality. The pre-built admin tools for FastAPI may not end up being popular for FastAPI developers, but they serve as a step in the process to evaluate FastAPI or where Oppkey ends up.

**Recent Improvement**: The codebase has been refactored to follow a Model-View-Service (MVS) architecture, improving maintainability and separation of concerns. See [Architecture Overview](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

```

## ðŸŽ¯ Evaluation Focus

This setup allows your team to quickly evaluate:

1. **FastAPI Admin Interface** - Compare with Django Admin
2. **Authentication System** - JWT + Session-based auth plus FastAPI Users' PasswordHelper
3. **Database Management** - [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) + [Alembic migrations](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/)
4. **User Management** - [FastAPI Users](https://fastapi-users.github.io/fastapi-users/latest/)
5. **Development Experience** - Environment variables, management commands
6. **Production Readiness** - PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, environment config

The goal is to assess whether FastAPI + pre-built admin tools can provide a Django-like development experience for your developer team.
