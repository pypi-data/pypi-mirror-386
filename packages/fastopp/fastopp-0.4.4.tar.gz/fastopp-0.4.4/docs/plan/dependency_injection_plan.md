## 🔐 Authentication System Implementation

**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED WITH DEPENDENCY INJECTION ✅

### What's Been Implemented

**Authentication Dependencies** (`dependencies/auth.py`):
- **JWT Token Management**: `create_access_token()` and `verify_token()` with settings injection
- **User Authentication**: `get_current_user_from_cookies()` with database session injection
- **Role-Based Access Control**: `get_current_staff_or_admin()` for permission checking
- **Token Creation**: `create_user_token()` using dependency injection

**Route Integration**:
- **Authentication Routes** (`routes/auth.py`): Login/logout with database session injection
- **Protected Routes** (`routes/pages.py`): User authentication with DI
- **API Routes** (`routes/api.py`): Staff/admin authentication with DI
- **Webinar Routes** (`routes/webinar.py`): Permission-based access with DI

**SQLAdmin Integration**:
- **Fixed Authentication Bug**: `AdminAuth.authenticate()` now properly checks session state
- **Session Management**: Login sets proper session data, logout clears session
- **Role-Based Admin Access**: Admin views respect user permissions

**Framework Integration**:
- **`oppdemo.py` Integration**: Auth directory properly saved and restored
- **State Management**: Authentication DI survives `oppdemo.py save/restore` cycles
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with both framework and demo states

### Key Educational Benefits

**Students Learn**:
- **JWT Token Management**: How to create and verify tokens with dependency injection
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Cookie-based auth with proper session lifecycle
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Permission checking with dependency injection
- **Admin Panel Integration**: How to integrate authentication with SQLAdmin
- **Framework State Management**: How authentication works across different app states

**Real-World Patterns**:
- **Centralized Authentication**: All auth logic uses dependency injection
- **Security Best Practices**: Proper token lifecycle and session management
- **Admin Panel Security**: Role-based access control for administrative functions
- **Framework Integration**: Authentication that works with complex state management

### Testing and Validation

**Authentication System Testing**:
- ✅ **JWT Token Creation**: Tokens created with proper expiration and claims
- ✅ **Token Verification**: Invalid tokens properly rejected
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Database session injection works correctly
- ✅ **Role-Based Access**: Permission checking functions as expected
- ✅ **SQLAdmin Integration**: Admin panel requires proper authentication
- ✅ **Session Management**: Login/logout properly manages session state

**Framework Integration Testing**:
- ✅ **`oppdemo.py save`**: Auth directory properly backed up to `demo_assets/`
- ✅ **`oppdemo.py restore`**: Auth directory properly restored from backup
- ✅ **State Switching**: Authentication works in both framework and demo states
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved

**Application Testing**:
- ✅ **Route Handlers**: All protected routes use authentication DI
- ✅ **Database Sessions**: Proper session lifecycle management
- ✅ **Configuration**: Settings properly injected throughout auth system
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
