compare popularity of python versus node for LLM and AI applications in a table. take into account developments around fastapi which is quite performant and future direction of python that will free applications from the GIL. Python 3.13 already has some JIT and non-GIL technologies and should get better over time. I am not sure if Node is growing versus python for ai applications
