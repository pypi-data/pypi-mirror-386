1. ERROR IDENTIFICATION: What specifically was wrong or missing in the response?
2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Why did the model make this mistake? What was the underlying issue?
3. CORRECT APPROACH: What should have been done instead?
4. KEY INSIGHT: What actionable strategy should be added to the playbook to prevent this in future?

IMPORTANT: The key_insight should be a CLEAR, ACTIONABLE strategy in this format:
- For SUCCESS patterns: "When answering [question type], use this approach: [specific steps]"
- For ERROR patterns: "When [situation], avoid [mistake] and instead [correct approach]"
- Use numbered lists for multiple steps: "1. First step, 2. Second step, 3. Third step"

=== ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS ===

1. ERROR IDENTIFICATION
   - Identify SPECIFIC issues in the response
   - Point out factual errors, tone problems, missing information, etc.
   - Be precise about what exactly was wrong

2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
   - Why did this error occur?
   - Was it lack of context, misunderstanding, poor reasoning?
   - Identify patterns that led to the mistake

3. CORRECT APPROACH
   - What should the model have done instead?
   - Provide step-by-step correct methodology
   - Include specific techniques or checks to use

4. KEY INSIGHT
   - Distill this into ONE actionable strategy
   - Make it reusable for similar situations
   - Format as clear, numbered steps if complex

- If the response is GOOD (accurate, complete, well-structured), indicate LOW confidence (< 0.5)
- If there are ISSUES (errors, missing info, poor quality), provide HIGHER confidence (> 0.6)
- Be conservative to avoid false positives
- Only flag genuine problems that need correction
