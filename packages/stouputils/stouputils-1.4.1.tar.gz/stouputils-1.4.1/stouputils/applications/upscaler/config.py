"""
This module provides configuration settings and constants for the upscaler application.

It defines the URLs for downloading dependencies like waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan and FFmpeg,
and provides a Config class with settings for upscaling operations, including output quality,
bitrates, executable paths, and command-line arguments for the underlying tools.

Configuration options include:
- Image quality settings (JPG quality)
- Video encoding parameters (bitrate, codec, etc.)
- Paths to external binaries (FFmpeg, waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan)
- Command-line arguments for upscaling and video processing

""" YouTube bitrate recommendations for different resolutions and frame rates.

This dictionary contains recommended bitrates for YouTube uploads based on:
- SDR vs HDR content
- Standard frame rate (24, 25, 30 fps) vs high frame rate (48, 50, 60 fps)
- Video resolution (from 360p up to 8K)

The values are in kbps (kilobits per second).
