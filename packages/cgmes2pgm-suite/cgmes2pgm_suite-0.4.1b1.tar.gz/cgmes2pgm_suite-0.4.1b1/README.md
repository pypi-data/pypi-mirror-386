# CGMES2PGM-Suite

`cgmes2pgm_suite` provides additional tools for `cgmes2pgm_converter` to integrate [PowerGridModel](https://github.com/PowerGridModel/power-grid-model) with the Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES).
It focuses on performing the state estimation on CGMES datasets.

## Features

- Start an Apache Jena Fuseki as docker container
- Upload Datasets to a SPARQL endpoint
- Human readable exports of PGM Datasets in TXT and Excel
- Create SV-Profile from PGM Results
- Debug state estimation by manipulating datasets (e.g., subnet splitting)
- Configure conversion and state estimation via a configuration file
- Simulate measurements:
  - when real measurements are not provided via an Operation Profile, but a State Variable (SV) Profile is available
  - generates an Operation Profile with distorted measurements based on the SV Profile

## Installation

The package can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install cgmes2pgm_suite
```

To start an Apache Jena Fuseki server via this package, Docker is required.
See [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Usage

This package can be run as a standalone application, performing the conversion and running PGM's state estimation. To do so, you need to install the package and then run the following command:

```bash
python -m cgmes2pgm_suite --config <path_to_config_file>
```

The provided configuration file contains the dataset configuration and the parameters for the conversion and state estimation.
An example configuration file can be found in [/example](./example).

### Quick Start

For a quick start, we recommend cloning this project and using the provided test cases.

If the project is cloned, setup the environment and install the package:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

To run the Conformity Datasets, you need to download `Test Configurations v3.0.3` from [ENTSO-E CIM Conformity and Interoperability](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/cim/cim-conformity-and-interoperability/) respecting their License.
Place the rdf/xml files of each dataset in the respective subdirectory of `tests/datasets`.

Afterwards, you can run all datasets using:

```bash
pytest -m "integration"
```

> Note: Running the tests creates a Fuseki Docker container on port 3030.
> The container is automatically removed after the tests are finished.

The results of the tests can be found in the `tests/out` directory.

If you want to add your own datasets, the following steps are required:

- Place the rdf/xml files in the `tests/data/` directory
- Create a configuration file in the `tests/configs/` directory, by copying an existing one
- Update the name, output directory and location of the rdf/xml files in the new configuration file

### Datasets

The conversion, measurement simulation and state estimation has been tested with the CGMES conformity datasets.

The following datasets have been tested:

| Dataset | Size (Nodes) | Estimation Result | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PowerFlow | 2 | ðŸŸ¢ | |
| PST | 2 | ðŸŸ¢ | All three Scenarios |
| MiniGrid | 13 | ðŸŸ¢ | |
| MicroGrid | 13 | ðŸŸ¢ | PST with AsymmetricalPhaseTapChanger (BE-TR2_2) has been split |
| SmallGrid | 167 | ðŸŸ¢ | |
| Svedala | 191 | ðŸŸ¢ | |
| RealGrid | 6051 | ðŸŸ¡ | Requires smaller sigmas in measurement simulation to converge |
| FullGrid | 26 | ? | SV-Profile does not contain power flows for all branches, resulting in an insufficient amount of simulated measurements |

> Dataset Version: CGMES Conformity Assessment Scheme Test Configurations v3.0.2

The used configuration files can be found in the [/tests/configs](./tests/configs) directory.
