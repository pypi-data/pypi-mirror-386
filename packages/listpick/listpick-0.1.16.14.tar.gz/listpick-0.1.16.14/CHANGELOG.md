# CHANGELOG.md
Note that the changes between 0.1.11.0 and 1.1.12.0 are listed under 0.1.11

## [0.1.16.14] 2025-10-??
 - Fixed settings not loading when Picker has no rows
 - Fixed footer not displaying correctly when Picker has no rows.

## [0.1.16.13] 2025-10-15
 - Updated edit_menu_keys.

## [0.1.16.12] 2025-10-14
 - Feature added: Edit selected cells in nvim (key 'E')--only works for cells in editable columns.
 - Feature added: toggle visible columns menu (accessible from settings (~)).
 - Fixed bugs and improved experience in Picker with hidden columns:
   - Fixed rare row alignment problems with hidden columns
   - Fixed certain problems with displaying highlights when columns are hidden
   - Fixed row widths readjusting twice (but visually noticable) when columns are hidden
   - Ensured that when moving to next/prev column we only move skip over hidden columns
 - Added alternate_selection_char which allows, e.g., â˜’, to indicate the selection status rather than a coloured character.
 - The picker state is now passed to the data generation function which allows a stop event to be created, and triggered to tell the worker thread to stop sending jobs to the other threads.
 - We now track threads and jobs that are created when generating cell values:
  - We clean up the threads when exiting a picker.
  - Eventually we will create a 


## [0.1.16.11] 2025-10-03
 - Added some missing docstrings for helper functions.
 - Refactored cell selection and list-padding logic.
 - Removed broad try/except blocks in display code, relying on stricter checks.
 - Adjusted Picker keyboard mapping for `opts_input` to use `META_o`.
 - Simplified get_selected_cells_by_row using `collections.defaultdict`.

## [0.1.16.10] 2025-09-23
 - Created separate header_separator with "   |" as the default which shows borders between the column-headers.
 - Created ensure_no_overscroll() method to ensure we do not scroll past the data-set when we move the cursor down, select different columns, resize the terminal, etc.
  - Mostly needed for consistency as each of these actions had effectively implemented their own version.


## [0.1.16.9] 2025-09-22
- Feature added: support for displaying a left pane.
- Adjust leftmost_char when we resize the terminal.
- Added option to settings to allow one to precisely set the leftmost_char from the settings--lmc=83

## [0.1.16.4-6] 2025-09-09
- Ensured that the previous terminal settings are restored after exiting the picker.
- Fixed bug which caused crash when opening the input field.

## [0.1.16.4] 2025-09-09
 - Commands passed to generate_picker_data can now use multiple {} and each will be replaced by the filename
   - E.g., `[[ -f {} ]] && du -h {}`
 - Improved the handling of filenames when opening files and generating column-data for files.
 - Hide header in notifications.

## [0.1.16.2] 2025-09-07
 - Fixed some f-strings with nested quotes.

## [0.1.16.1] 2025-09-07
 - Massive improvements to Picker data generation.
   - Data generation is now multithreaded.
     - ~5x quicker when getting information on video files
   - Data generation is now done **asynchronously**.
     - generate_picker_data sets the header and items of the Picker with only the Files column filled. The rest of the cells have "..." as a placeholder. Multiple threads are created and they generate data for each of the cells.
     - The Picker can receive user interaction while the data loads.
   - Implemented a task priority queue which the threads utilise to determine their next task.
     - Cells that are in view are prioritised in the queue and are generated first.
   - Created generate_picker_data_from_file() function and separated the generation-specific code into the original generate_picker_data() function.
     - This allows one to utilise the new generation capabilities by simply passing a list of functions and filenames to the generate_picker_data() function--no toml file necessary.
       - This has been implemented in lpfman to display file attributes.
 - Bug fixes:
    - Static footer string was not displayed in some cases.

## [0.1.16.1] 2025-09-05

 - Added different colour for header background to the left/right of the header.

## [0.1.15.12] 2025-08-30
 - Added crosshair_cursor option which highlights the entries of the active row and column.
 - splash_screen() now works with a list of strings as a message.

## [0.1.15.11] 2025-08-30
 - Added new quickscroll keys to scroll left/right by 25 chars.

## [0.1.15.10] 2025-08-29
 - Ensure that pane data is retrieved immediately when cycling through panes.

## [0.1.15.9] 2025-08-29
 - We can now have multiple right panes which can be cycled through by pressing ".

## [0.1.15.8] 2025-08-28

 - Fixed error with filtering when there are no rows (i.e., items=[[]])
 - Fixed error with changing modes when there are no rows (i.e., items=[[]]).

Fixed errors caused by filtering when items=[[]]; this also fixed problems changing modes when items=[[]].
## [0.1.15.3] 2025-08-27

## [0.1.14.0] - [0.1.14.14] 2025-08-24
 - Added info screen to display all information on the running Picker.
 - Added keys for file_next and file_prev
 - Added __sizeof__() function for the Picker class.
 - Fixed rows resizing twice when opening/switching between some files.
 - Added to settings: goto row, goto column
 - NaN replaced with empty string when loading empty cells from xlsx or ods files.
 - Added Picker.get_config(path) method.
 - Can now take input on stdin -- e.g., `du -h | listpick --stdin`
 - We now get user input via '/dev/tty' rather than stdscr.getch() (which uses stdin). 
   - This was necessary to ensure that we can pipe data in via stdin and still receive user input.
 - Bugs fixed:
   - Closing files causes issues switching between files.
   - Fixed crash when loading non-existent config file.
   - Fixed highlighted cell not being aligned in the way that we expect.
   - Fixed search query covering last row of data.
   - Discovered missing keys from colour_theme 0 which caused menus not to be displayed.
   - Setting colour_theme_number in the config now works.
 - Create ~/.config/listpick directory for storing input history if it doesn't already exist.
 - Added error checking when opening files.
 - Added --headerless flag to prevent interpreting the first line of the input as the header.
 - Fixed special keys not working:
   - arrow keys (main picker, input_field)
   - meta+key (input_field, main picker)
 - Added column number to footer
 - Improved splitting of whitespace separated data passed on stdin.
 - Ensured that main picker elements resize if the terminal is resized when other dialogues are in focus: notifications, options, settings.
 - Added method to check for terminal resize.
   - Was necessary since we are no longer using getch from curses so we can't test whether getch() == curses.KEY_RESIZE.
 - Added Alt+keys in build_help.

## [0.1.14] 2025-08-20
 - Fixed bug when cells are centred vertically.
 - Added "level" keyword for highlight dictionary.
  - l0: show highlight above base rows
  - l1: show highlight above selected cells/rows
  - l2: show highlight above cursor cell/row.
 - Added separate selected_column argument (distinct from sort_column) so that columns can be navigated without sorting on the selected column. 's' has to be pressed on the selected_column to trigger sorting.
 - Changed scrolling to start/end so that it selects the first/last column.
 - Bug fixes:
   - When data was centred vertically it would take an extra draw_screen loop to determine the proper column widths when the column sizes changed. This has been fixed.
   - Refreshing sorted data would resort it on the selected column rather than the sort column. Fixed.
   - Fixed error when padding uneven lists when a list of strings is passed instead of a list of lists.
   - Fixed crash when showing certain notifications. The notification message was not being split into lines properly.
   - Fixed wrong page number in the footer when paginate=True.
 - Added some extra options to the settings:
   - Toggle header
   - Toggle row header
   - Toggle modes
   - Add/insert blank row
   - Add/insert blank column
 - Added splash screen to picker which can be displayed when loading a large data set, for example.
 - Ensured that the curses colour pairs are redefined if we are loading from a picker save state.
 - Added functions to insert an empty row/column at an an arbitrary position in the picker items.
 - Adjusted the commandline arguments so that the filename can be passed without the -i flag.
 - If no input file type is specified on the command line it will now guess based on the input file's extension.
 - Improved display of cells/rows with various unicode characters. It is much better but there are still some problems with alignment and highlighting.
 - Setup logging for the Picker class. Currently still very basic but will track to the last function that was run before crash if the --debug flag is passed to the picker.
 - Added pin_cursor options which keeps the cursor on the same row during a refresh rather than tracking the id of the highlighted row. 
 - Updated StandardFooter. Now shows information on two lines rather than three; all cursor and selection information on the first line and the sort information on the second. Cursor, Visual (de)selection now abreviated to C, VS, and VDS.
 - Added try-except wrapper to draw_screen function to prevent crashes during rapid resizing.
 - Speed improvements:
   - Create and track self.selected_cells_by_row when selections change rather than derive it from the self.cell_selections
     - Much faster with very large data sets as we need to determine selected_cells_by_row every time we run self.draw_screen()
 - We can now pipe data from cells in multiple columns to a command.
   - e.g., pipe two cols to gnuplot
 - Features added:
   - Listpick now supports multiple open files.
     - 'file_next' setting
   - Listpick now supports files with multiple sheets.
     - 'sheet_next' setting

 - Fixed bug which showed a distorted footer when the footer string was one char longer than the width of the terminal.
 - Can now display a left-justified column indicating the row numbers (show_row_header)
 - Selecting column to the left or right now scrolls the selected column into view.
 - Input field autocompletion significantly improved.
   - Now shows popup list showing the next autocomplete suggestions
   - Supports auto-completing any words passed to the auto_complete_words argument of the input_field function
     - Search and filter autocomplete any words in the items of the picker by default.
   - Supports auto-complete functions %time and %date
   - Supports auto-complete formulae.
     - Will allow formulae filling at a later date.
   - Can now edit input_field string in nvim by pressing ctrl+x
 - Added functionality to add (empty) rows after the cursor and add (empty) columns after the cursor.

     - Alt+f: forwards one word
     - Alt+b: backwards one word
     - Ctrl+g: exit
     - Ctrl+y: Yank from the top of the kill ring
     - Alt+y: Yank from the kill ring. As is typical, this only works after a yank.
     - Ctrl+n: Cycle forwards through history
     - Ctrl+p: Cycle backwards through history
   - Now accepts curses colour pair to set colours.
 - Fixed bug where searching with a lot of matches causes slow down.
