  INFRA-COMPASS is an innovative software tool utilizing
  Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically compile and
  update an inventory of state and local codes and
  ordinances related to energy infrastructure. Given the
  multitude of jurisdictions involved, automating the
  inventory process through AI is crucial for monitoring and
  understanding the implementation of these ordinances. The
  inventory aids in improving and expediting the permitting
  process in several ways. It enhances transparency for
  stakeholders, including energy developers, government
  officials, and communities, by detailing existing siting
  and permitting requirements. It also facilitates
  comparisons of regulatory variations across jurisdictions
  and over time, linking these to permit timelines,
  technical assistance efforts, and deployment rates to
  identify best practices. INFRA-COMPASS also provides
  insights for jurisdictions revising their rules and helps
  developers conduct comparative analyses to better assess
  energy development opportunities. Furthermore,
  INFRA-COMPASS improves the accuracy of energy modeling
  tools by ensuring they accurately reflect current
  policies.
