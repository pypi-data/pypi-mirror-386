class DataModel(dict):
    """A managed data model.

    When constructing a data model the LinkAhead representation can easily be
    created using the classes RecordType and Propery, storing them in a
    Container and inserting it in LinkAhead. However, this has one drawback: You
    cannot simply change someting and update the container. The container will
    insist on having valid ids for all contained Entities.

    This class allows you to define your model as easily but also provides you
    with a method (`sync_data_model`) that will sync with the data model in an
    existing LinkAhead instance.

    This is possible because entities, defined in this model, are identified
    with entities in LinkAhead using names. I.e. a RecordType "Experiment" in this
    model will update an existing RecordType with name "Experiment" in LinkAhead.
    Thus, be carefull not to change existing Entities that were created for a
    different purpose (e.g. someone else's experiment).

    DataModel inherits from dict. The keys are always the names of the
    entities. Thus you cannot have unnamed or ambiguously named entities in your
    model.

    Additionally the DataModel takes an ``enums`` array parameter.  This contains LinkAhead records
    which should serve as enum values.  At present this only is relevant for synchronization with
    the LinkAhead server: These enum records will be synchronized just like the record types upon
    ``sync_data_model``.

    Example:
    --------

    # Create a DataModel with a RecordType and a Property, not assuming any
    # relation between the two.
    dm = DataModel([db.RecordType(name="myRecordType"),
                    db.Property(name="myProperty")])
    # Sync the DataModel with the server, so that the server state is consistent
    # with this DataModel's content.
    dm.sync_data_model()
    # Now the DataModel's IDs are the same as on the server.
