        Parameters
        ----------
        export_dict : dict or string
            dictionary with the names of the entries to be exported as
            keys. The values are again dictionaries specifying whether
            the entries are optional, which function or query should
            be used to find the value for the corresponding entry and
            possible error explanations if values are missing. Can be
            either a dict or a string specifying the path of a json
            file containing that dict. See Notes for further details.
        record : Record or None, optional
            record which is inserted into possible queries. Must be
            given if there are queries in export_dict. Default is None.
        raise_error_if_missing : bool, optional
            specify whether an error is raised if mandatory entries
            are missing or whether an error message is forwarded to a
            logger. Default is False.

        Notes
        -----
            The entries of the export_dict are themselves dictionaries
            of the form
            ```
            {"entry_to_be_exported: {
                "optional": True/False
                "find_func": callable or name of member function
                "query": query string
                "selector": selector for the query
                "error": error explanation
                }
            }
            ```
            All entries are optional; `query` and `find_func` are
            mutually exclusive and an error will be raised if both are
            provided. The indivdual entries mean:

            - optional: True or False, if not present, the entry is
              assumed to be mandatory.
            - find_func: name of the member function that returns the
              value for this entry or callable object. Must not exist
              together with `query`
            - query: Query string for finding the value for this
              entry. If this is given, a record must be given to the
              constructor of this class. The query is then executed as
              `db.execute_query(query.format(record.id). unique=True)`
              so it must return a unique result from which the value
              can be extracted via
              `query_result.get_property_values(selector)`.
            - selector: only relevant if query is given. This is usesd
              as a selector in a call to `get_property_values` on the
              result of the query. If no selector is given, it is
              guessed from the second word of the query string (as in
              `SELECT something FROM something else`).
            - error: only relevant for mandatory entries. If the entry
              is missing, an explanatory string can be provided here
              that is used for a more verbose error output.
