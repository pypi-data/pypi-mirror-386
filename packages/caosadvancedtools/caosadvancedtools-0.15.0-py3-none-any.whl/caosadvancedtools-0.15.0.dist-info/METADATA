# README

## Welcome

This is the **LinkAhead Advanced User Tools** repository and a part of the
LinkAhead project.

This project contains tools that are beyond the typical use of
the LinkAhead python client. Especially, this includes the crawler which will
typically be used by a data curator.

## Setup

Please read the [README_SETUP.md](README_SETUP.md) for instructions on how to
setup this code.

## Further Reading

Please refer to the [official
documentation](https://docs.indiscale.com/caosdb-advanced-user-tools/) for more
information.

## Contributing

Thank you very much to all contributers—[past,
present](https://gitlab.com/linkahead/linkahead/-/blob/dev/HUMANS.md), and prospective
ones.
