## [Unreleased]

## [6.0.1] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed

- **Installer: Architecture suffix handling** - Fixed dpkg package detection on ARM64 and other multi-arch systems
  - Package names with architecture suffixes (e.g., `python3-dev:arm64`) are now correctly detected as installed
  - Fixes false negatives where installed packages were reported as missing on ARM64 Ubuntu
  - Tested on Ubuntu ARM64 with `libasound2-dev:arm64` and `libportaudio2:arm64`

## [6.0.0] - 2025-10-16

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Selective Tool Loading by Default** - Dramatically reduced token usage by loading only essential tools
  - Only `converse` and `service` tools loaded by default (2.6k tokens vs previous 26k tokens)
  - **90% reduction in MCP tool token usage** from ~26,000 to ~2,600 tokens
  - New configuration options for controlling tool loading:
    - `VOICEMODE_TOOLS_ENABLED` - Whitelist specific tools (e.g., "converse,service")
    - `VOICEMODE_TOOLS_DISABLED` - Blacklist specific tools (loads all except those listed)
  - Default: `VOICEMODE_TOOLS_ENABLED=converse,service` for minimal token footprint
  - Users who need additional tools can enable them via configuration

- **Converse Tool Parameter Renames** - Clarified listen duration parameter names
  - `listen_duration` → `listen_duration_max` (maximum recording duration)
  - `min_listen_duration` → `listen_duration_min` (minimum recording duration before silence detection)
  - Paired max/min suffixes make parameter relationship clearer

- **Audio Feedback Configuration Variable Renames** - Renamed for clarity
  - `VOICEMODE_PIP_LEADING_SILENCE` → `VOICEMODE_CHIME_LEADING_SILENCE`
  - `VOICEMODE_PIP_TRAILING_SILENCE` → `VOICEMODE_CHIME_TRAILING_SILENCE`

### 🎉 Major Project Rebrand: VoiceMCP → VoiceMode

We're excited to announce that **voice-mcp** has been rebranded to **VoiceMode**! 

This change reflects our vision for the project's future. While MCP (Model Context Protocol) describes the underlying technology, VoiceMode better captures what this tool actually delivers - a seamless voice interaction mode for AI assistants.

#### Why the Change?
- **Clarity**: VoiceMode immediately communicates the tool's purpose
- **Timelessness**: The name isn't tied to a specific protocol that may evolve
- **Simplicity**: Easier to remember and more intuitive for users

#### What's Changed?
- Primary command renamed from `voice-mcp` to `voicemode`
- GitHub repository moved to `mbailey/voicemode`
- Primary PyPI package is now `voice-mode` (hyphenated due to naming restrictions)
- Legacy `voice-mcp` package maintained for backward compatibility
- Documentation and branding updated throughout
- Simplified package structure to dual-package configuration
