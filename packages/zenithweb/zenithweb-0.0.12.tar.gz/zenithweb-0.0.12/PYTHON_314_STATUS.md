# Python 3.14 Investigation - Current Status

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Session:** Fedora Claude Code → Mac Claude Code handoff

## What Was Done

### 1. Pulled Latest Code from GitHub
- Started from v0.0.7 (already released to PyPI)
- All previous security fixes (v0.0.4-0.0.7) already released

### 2. Investigated Python 3.14 Features

**Evaluated 5 features:**

| Feature | Status | Decision | Reason |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| PEP 649 - Deferred Annotations | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | Added to 6 core files | Works on 3.12+, real benefits |
| PEP 750 - Template Strings | ❌ REJECTED | Skip | Syntax-only, no implementation |
| Free-Threading Mode | ✅ COMPATIBLE | No changes needed | Already works |
| Multiple Interpreters | ❌ REJECTED | Skip | Too niche |
| Asyncio Introspection | ❌ REJECTED | Skip | Version-specific code |

### 3. Implementation: Future Annotations

Added `from __future__ import annotations` to 6 core modules:

```
zenith/core/application.py
zenith/core/service.py
zenith/core/container.py
zenith/core/routing/executor.py
zenith/auth/jwt.py
zenith/db/async_engine.py
```

**Before:** 7 files with future annotations
**After:** 13 files with future annotations

### 4. Testing

```bash
# Tested core modules
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_application.py \
             tests/unit/test_service_di_injection.py \
             tests/unit/test_authentication.py

Result: 41/41 tests passing ✅
```

### 5. Committed & Pushed

**Commits:**
1. `21126ae` - perf: add future annotations import to 6 core modules
2. `cbdd62d` - docs: add Python 3.14 feature analysis and implementation summary

**Documentation:** `docs/internal/PYTHON_3.14_ANALYSIS.md`

## Current Repository State

```bash
Branch: main
Version: 0.0.7 (in __version__.py)
Status: Clean working tree
PyPI: v0.0.7 released
GitHub: v0.0.7 + 2 new commits (unreleased)
```

## Recommendation

**Don't add 3.14-only features because:**
- Framework works perfectly on 3.14 without special code
- Version-specific code fragments userbase (3.12, 3.13 users)
- Features like t-strings aren't implemented yet (syntax only)
- Future annotations work on all versions (3.12+)

**What we did add:**
- Future annotations = better performance on ALL versions
- No breaking changes
- No version checks
- Immediate benefits

## Next Steps

If you want to release v0.0.8:
1. Bump version in `zenith/__version__.py` to `0.0.8`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with perf improvement
3. Build: `uv build`
4. Release: `twine upload dist/zenithweb-0.0.8*`
5. Tag: `git tag v0.0.8 && git push --tags`

Or keep working on other improvements for v0.0.8.
