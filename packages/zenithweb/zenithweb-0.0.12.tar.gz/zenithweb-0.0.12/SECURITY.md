## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Open a Public Issue

Security vulnerabilities should **not** be reported via public GitHub issues as this could put users at risk.

### 2. Report Privately

Please report security vulnerabilities by:

- **Email**: nijaru7@gmail.com
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Zenith vulnerability report`

### 3. Include in Your Report

To help us address the issue quickly, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information

### 4. What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: Every 72 hours during investigation

## Security Best Practices

When using Zenith in production:

### 1. Keep Dependencies Updated

```bash
uv pip list --outdated
uv pip install --upgrade zenithweb
```

### 2. Use Strong Secret Keys

```bash
# Generate a secure secret key
zen keygen

# Or use Python
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

### 3. Enable Security Middleware

```python
from zenith import Zenith
from zenith.middleware import SecurityHeadersMiddleware, CSRFMiddleware

app = Zenith()
app.add_middleware(SecurityHeadersMiddleware, {
    "force_https": True,
    "hsts_max_age": 31536000,
})
app.add_middleware(CSRFMiddleware)
```

### 4. Regular Security Audits

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
uv run pip-audit

# Run linting with security checks
uv run ruff check . --select S
```

### 5. Environment Variables

Never commit secrets to version control:

```bash
# .env (gitignored)
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db
```
