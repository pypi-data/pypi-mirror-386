Verification Script - FSM Fixes (v1.0.2)

Summary of fixes (v1.0.2):
  ✓ FIX 1: Failed state is NOT final (allows retry transitions)
  ✓ FIX 2: FSM reset uses new instances (not send("idle"))
  ✓ Retry transition works: failed → ready
  ✓ Multiple retry cycles are supported
  ✓ All state properties are correctly configured

Both critical bugs are fixed!

State Flow:
  idle → ready → running → completed (FINAL)
                    ↓           ↑
                  failed  ------┘ (retry)

Reset Method:
  ✗ OLD: node.fsm.send("idle")  # Doesn't work
  ✓ NEW: node.fsm = AgentTaskMachine(agent_name)  # Works!

Next steps:
  1. Use the fixed fsm.py (v1.0.2) in your ai-parrot library
  2. Run your test case - it should work now!
  3. Both errors are fixed!
