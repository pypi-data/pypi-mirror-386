v0.7.6 - Newton's Nature (July, 31, 2024)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- Implement new equations for the heat exchanger, i.e. effectiveness parameter.
  The parameter can be specified for the hot side `eff_hot` or the cold side
  `eff_cold` of the heat exchanger. Additionally, it is possible to specify the
  maximum value of both with `eff_max` if it is unknown, which one of them will
  be the larger one (`PR #529 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/529>`__).

Bug Fixes
#########
- The enthalpy numerical precision critereon for mixtures is relaxed: Mixture
  fluid property results (temperature, volume, entropy, ...) are only
  invalidated, if both absolute and relative precision is not acquired.
  Previously, the enthalpy of the mixture, calculated with the temperature
  calculated based on the enthalpy determined by the solver had to be within
  :code:`1e-3` of the enthalpy determined by the solver
  (`PR #529 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/529>`__).

Bug Fixes
#########
- Fix the logging text for component paramter value violation in the
  postprocessing (`PR #529 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/529>`__).
