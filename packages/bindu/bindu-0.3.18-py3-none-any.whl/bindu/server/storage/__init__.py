"""STORAGE MODULE EXPORTS.

This module provides the storage layer for the bindu framework.
It exposes different storage implementations for tasks and contexts.

BURGER STORE ANALOGY:

Think of this as the restaurant's order management system catalog:

1. STORAGE INTERFACE (Storage):
   - Abstract base class defining the storage contract
   - All storage implementations must follow this interface
   - Ensures consistent API across different storage backends

2. STORAGE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
   - InMemoryStorage: Fast whiteboard system (development/testing)

3. USAGE PATTERNS:
   - Import the base Storage class for type hints and interfaces
   - Import specific implementations based on your needs
   - All implementations are interchangeable through the Storage interface

AVAILABLE STORAGE OPTIONS:
- InMemoryStorage: Lightning-fast temporary storage
