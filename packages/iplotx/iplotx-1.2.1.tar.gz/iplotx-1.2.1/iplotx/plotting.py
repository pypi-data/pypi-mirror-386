    """Plot this network and/or vertex grouping using the specified layout.

    Parameters:
        network: The network to plot. Can be a networkx or igraph graph.
        layout: The layout to use for plotting. If None, a layout will be looked for in the
            network object and, if none is found, an exception is raised. Defaults to None.
        vertex_labels: The labels for the vertices. If None or False, no vertex labels
            will be drawn. If a list, the labels are taken from the list. If a dict, the keys
            should be the vertex IDs and the values should be the labels. If True (a single
            bool value), the vertex IDs will be used as labels.
        node_labels: Same meaning as vertex_labels. This is an alias to help users who prefer
            the word "node" over "vertex". If both vertex_labels and node_labels are specified,
            "node_labels" overrides "vertex_labels".
        edge_labels: The labels for the edges. If None, no edge labels will be drawn. Defaults
            to None.
        ax: The axis to plot on. If None, a new figure and axis will be created. Defaults to
            None.
        style: Apply this style for the objects to plot. This can be a sequence (e.g. list)
            of styles and they will be applied in order.
        title: If not None, set the axes title to this value.
        aspect: If not None, set the aspect ratio of the axis to this value. In 2D, the most
            common value is 1.0, which proportionates x- and y-axes. In 3D, only string
            values are accepted (see the documentation of Axes.set_aspect).
        margins: How much margin to leave around the plot. A higher value (e.g. 0.1) can be
            used as a quick fix when some vertex shapes reach beyond the plot edge. This is
            a fraction of the data limits, so 0.1 means 10% of the data limits will be left
            as margin. A pair (in 2D) or triplet (in 3D) of floats can also be provided and
            applied to each axis separately.
        strip_axes: If True, remove axis spines and ticks. In 3D, only ticks are removed.
        figsize: If ax is None, a new matplotlib Figure is created. This argument specifies
            the (width, height) dimension of the figure in inches. If ax is not None, this
            argument is ignored. If None, the default matplotlib figure size is used.
        kwargs: Additional arguments are treated as an alternate way to specify style. If
            both "style" and additional **kwargs are provided, they are both applied in that
            order (style, then **kwargs).

    Returns:
        A list of mpl.artist.Artist objects, set as a direct child of the matplotlib Axes.
        The list can have one or two elements, depending on whether you are requesting to
        plot a network, a grouping, or both.

            useful for labels that are specific to leaf nodes only (e.g. species in a

            to internal nodes too (e.g. branch support values). This redundancy is left on

        show_support: If True, show the support values for the nodes (assumed to be from 0 to 100,
            rounded to nearest integer). If both this parameter and vertex_labels are set,
            show_support takes precedence and hides the vertex labels.
