def read_spin_directions(filename: str):
    r"""
    Reads spin directions from the file.

    Parameters
    ----------

    filename : str
        File with the spin directions. See notes for the details of its content.

    Returns
    -------

    spin_directions : (M, ) :numpy:`ndarray`
        Array with the spin directions. Each row is a spin direction vector normalized to
        1.


    Notes
    -----

    The file is expected to contain three numbers per line, here is an example for two
    spins

    .. code-block:: text

        S1_x S1_y S1_z
        S2_x S2_y S2_z

    Only the direction of the spin vector is recognized, the modulus is ignored. Comments
    are allowed at any place of the file and preceded by the symbol "#". If the symbol "#"
    is found, then the rest of the line is ignored. Here are examples of valid use of the
    comments

    .. code-block:: text

        # Spin vectors for the material XX
        S1_x S1_y S1_z # Atom X1
        # This comments is here by some reason
        S2_x S2_y S2_z # Atom X2
