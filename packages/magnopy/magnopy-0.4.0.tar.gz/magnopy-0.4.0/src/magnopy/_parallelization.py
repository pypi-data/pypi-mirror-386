def multiprocess_over_k(
    kpoints, function, relative=False, units="meV", number_processors=None
):
    r"""
    Parallelizes calculation over the kpoints using |multiprocessing|_ module.

    Parameters
    ----------

    kpoints : (N, 3) |array-like|_
        List of the kpoints.

    function : callable
        Function that process one kpoint and is called as

        .. code-block:: python

            result = function(kpoints[i], relative, units)

    relative : bool, default False
        If ``relative=True``, then ``k`` is interpreted as given relative to the
        reciprocal unit cell. Otherwise it is interpreted as given in absolute
        coordinates.

    units : str, default "meV"
        .. versionadded:: 0.3.0

        Units of energy. See :py:attr:`.SpinHamiltonian.units` for the list of
        supported units.

    number_processors : int, optional
        By default magnopy uses all available processes. Pass ``number_processors=1`` to
        run in serial.

    Returns
    -------

    results : (N, ) list
        List of objects that are returned by the ``function``.

    Notes
    -----

    When using this function of magnopy in your Python scripts make sure to safeguard
    your script with the

    .. code-block:: python

        import magnopy

        # Import more stuff
        # or
        # Define your functions, classes

        if __name__ == "__main__":

            # Write your executable code here

    For more information refer to the  "Safe importing of main module" section in
    |multiprocessing|_ docs.
