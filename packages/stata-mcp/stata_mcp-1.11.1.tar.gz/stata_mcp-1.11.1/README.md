## üí° Quick Start
### Use Stata-MCP in Claude Code
We can use Stata-MCP in Claude Code as its prefect agentic ability. 

Before using it, please make sure you have ever install `Claude Code`, if you don't know how to install it, visit on [GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)

You can open your terminal and `cd` to your working directory, and run:
```bash
claude mcp add stata-mcp --env STATA-MCP-CWD=$(pwd) -- uvx stata-mcp
```

Then, you can use Stata-MCP in Claude Code. Here are some scenarios for using it:

- **Paper Replication**: Replicate empirical studies from economics papers
- **Quick Hypothesis Testing**: Validate economic hypotheses through regression analysis
- **Stata Learning Assistant**: Learn econometrics with step-by-step Stata explanations
- **Code Organization**: Review and optimize existing Stata do-files
- **Result Interpretation**: Understand complex statistical outputs and regression results

### Agent Mode
The details of agent mode find [here](agent_examples/README.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sepinetam/stata-mcp.git
cd stata-mcp

uv sync
uv pip install -e .

stata-mcp --version  # for test whether stata-mcp is installed successfully.
stata-mcp --agent  # now you have enjoy your stata-mcp agent mode.
```

or you can directly use it with `uvx`:
```bash
uvx stata-mcp --version  # for test whether it could be used on your computer.
uvx stata-mcp --agent
```

You can edit the task in `agent_examples/openai/main.py` for variable `model_instructions` and `task_message`, [click me](agent_examples/openai/main.py) #L37 and #L68

### Agent as Tool
If you want to use a Stata-Agent in another agent, [here](source/docs/Usages/agent_as_tool.md) is a simple example:

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner
from stata_mcp.agent_as_tool import StataAgent

# init stata agent and set as tool
stata_agent = StataAgent()
sa_tool = stata_agent.as_tool()

# Create main Agent
agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant", 
    tools=[sa_tool],
)

# Then run the agent as usual.
async def main(task: str, max_turns: int = 30):
    result = await Runner.run(agent, input=task, max_turns=max_turns)
    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    econ_task = "Use Stata default data to find out the relationship between mpg and price."
    asyncio.run(main(econ_task))

```


### AI Chat-Bot Client Mode
> Standard config requires: please make sure the stata is installed at the default path, and the stata cli (for macOS and Linux) exists.

The standard config json as follows, you can DIY your config via add envs.
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stata-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "stata-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For more detailed usage information, visit the [Usage guide](source/docs/Usages/Usage.md). 

And some advanced usage, visit the [Advanced guide](source/docs/Usages/Advanced.md)

### Prerequisites
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Package installer and virtual environment manager
- Claude, Cline, ChatWise, or other LLM service
- Stata License
- Your API-KEY from LLM

> Notes:
> 1. If you are located in China, a short uv usage document you can find [here](source/docs/ChinaUsers/uv.md).
> 2. Claude is the best choice for Stata-MCP, for Chinese, I recommend to use DeepSeek as your model provider as it is cheap and powerful, also the score is highest in China provider, if you are increased in it, visit the report [How to use StataMCP improve your social science research](https://reports.statamcp.com/202509/how_to_use_statamcp_improve_your_social_science_research).

### Installation
For the new version, you don't need to install the `stata-mcp` package again, you can just use the following command to check whether your computer can use stata-mcp.
```bash
uvx stata-mcp --usable
uvx stata-mcp --version
```

If you want to use it locally, you can install it via pip or download the source code.

**Download via pip**
```bash
pip install stata-mcp
```

**Download source code and compile**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sepinetam/stata-mcp.git
cd stata-mcp

uv build
```
Then you can find the compiled `stata-mcp` binary in the `dist` directory. You can use it directly or add it to your PATH.

For example:
```bash
uvx /path/to/your/whl/stata_mcp-1.11.1-py3-non-any.whl  # here is the wheel file name, you can change it to your version
```
