    LIST = "list"
    """Retrieve a list of child artifacts within a specified collection, supporting
        keyword-based fuzzy search, field-specific filters, and flexible ordering.
        This function allows detailed control over the search and pagination of
        artifacts in a collection, including staged artifacts if specified.

    Parameters:

        artifact_id (str): The id of the parent artifact or collection to list children
            from. It can be an uuid generated by create or edit function, or it can be
            an alias of the artifact under the current workspace. If you want to refer
            to an artifact in another workspace, you should use the full alias in the
            format of "workspace_id/alias". If not specified, the function lists all
            top-level artifacts in the current workspace.

        keywords (List[str], optional): A list of search terms used for fuzzy searching
            across all manifest fields. Each term is searched independently, and
            results matching any term will be included. For example,
            ["sample", "dataset"] returns artifacts containing either
            "sample" or "dataset" in any field of the manifest.

        filters (dict, optional): A dictionary where each key is a manifest field name
            and each value specifies the match for that field. Filters support both
            exact and range-based matching, depending on the field. You can filter
            based on the keys inside the manifest, as well as internal fields like
            permissions and view/download statistics. Supported internal
            fields include:

            type: Matches the artifact type exactly, e.g., {"type": "application"}.
            created_by: Matches the exact creator ID, e.g., {"created_by": "user123"}.
            created_at and last_modified: Accept a single timestamp (lower bound) or
                a range for filtering. For example,
                {"created_at": [1620000000, 1630000000]} filters artifacts created
                between the two timestamps.
            view_count and download_count: Accept a single value or a range for
                filtering, as with date fields. For example, {"view_count": [10, 100]}
                filters artifacts viewed between 10 and 100 times.
            permissions/<user_id>: Searches for artifacts with specific permissions
                assigned to the given user_id.
            version: Matches the exact version of the artifact, it only support
                "stage", "committed" or "*" (both staged or committed). If stage is
                specified, this filter should align with the stage parameter.
            manifest: Matches the exact value of the field, e.g.,
                "manifest": {"name": "example-dataset"}. These filters also support
                fuzzy matching if a value contains a wildcard (*),
                e.g., "manifest": {"name": "dataset*"}, depending on the SQL backend.
            config: Matches the exact value of the field in the config, e.g.,
                "config": {"collection_schema": {"type": "object"}}.

        mode (str, optional): Defines how multiple conditions
            (from keywords and filters) are combined. Use "AND" to ensure all
            conditions must match, or "OR" to include artifacts meeting any condition.
            Default is "AND".

        offset (int, optional): The number of artifacts to skip before listing results.
            Default is 0.

        limit (int, optional): The maximum number of artifacts to return.
            Default is 100.

        order_by (str, optional): The field used to order results. Options include:
            Built-in fields: view_count, download_count, last_modified, created_at,
                and id.
            Custom JSON fields: manifest.<field_name> or config.<field_name>
                (e.g., manifest.likes, config.priority).
            Use a suffix < or > to specify ascending or descending order, respectively
                (e.g., view_count< for ascending, manifest.likes> for descending).
            Default ordering is ascending by id if not specified.

        silent (bool, optional): If True, prevents incrementing the view count for
            the parent artifact when listing children. Default is False.

        stage: Controls which artifacts to return based on their staging status:
            True: Return only staged artifacts
            False: Return only committed artifacts (default)
            'all': Return both staged and committed artifacts

    Returns: A list of artifacts that match the search criteria, each represented by
        a dictionary containing all the fields."""
