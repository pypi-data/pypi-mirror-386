# Hypha Artifact

A Python library for interacting with [Hypha](https://github.com/amun-ai/hypha)
artifacts, providing both synchronous and asynchronous APIs
for file operations in Hypha workspaces.

This python package provide a convenient way to interact with
[hypha artifacts api](https://docs.amun.ai/#/artifact-manager). Allows you to
perform file operations on remote artifacts as if you are working with local files.

## What are Hypha Artifacts?

An **artifact** is a folder-like container that represents a project
application, dataset, or any organized collection of files with associated
metadata. Think of it as a smart directory that can be shared, versioned,
and searched across different environments.

### Key Characteristics

- **Folder-like Structure**: Contains an arbitrary number of files and
subdirectories, just like a regular filesystem folder
- **Rich Metadata**: Each artifact has searchable metadata (name, description,
tags, etc.) stored in a SQL database for efficient discovery
- **Cloud Storage**: Files are stored in S3-compatible storage with organized
prefixes for scalability and performance
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Can be accessed from anywhere with proper
credentials, enabling seamless collaboration

### Common Use Cases

#### ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & AI

- Store model weights, configurations, and training checkpoints
- Version datasets and preprocessing pipelines
- Share experiment results and analysis notebooks

### ðŸ“Š Data Science & Research

- Organize research datasets with rich metadata
- Share reproducible analysis workflows
- Store and version data processing scripts

#### ðŸš€ Application Development

- Store application assets (images, configs, static files)
- Version control for application builds and releases
- Share resources across development teams

#### ðŸ“š Documentation & Collaboration

- Centralized project documentation and resources
- Shared workspace for team collaboration
- Educational materials and tutorials

#### ðŸ”¬ Scientific Computing

- Store simulation results and parameters
- Share computational workflows and environments
- Archive experimental data with metadata

### Performance Features

#### ðŸš€ Multipart Upload Support

- Automatic multipart upload for files over 100MB
- Parallel chunk upload in async mode for faster transfers
- Configurable chunk sizes and thresholds
- Efficient handling of very large files (GB+)

#### âš¡ Concurrent Operations

- Async version supports parallel file operations
- Batch folder uploads with concurrent file transfers
- Optimized for high-throughput data workflows

### Example Artifact Structure

```pseudo
my-ml-project/                 # Artifact name
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata                   # Stored in SQL database
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ name: "my-ml-project"
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ description: "Image classification model"
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tags: ["ml", "vision", "pytorch"]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ created_by: "researcher@lab.edu"
â””â”€â”€ files/                     # Stored in S3 with prefix
    â”œâ”€â”€ model.pth              # Trained model weights
    â”œâ”€â”€ config.yaml            # Model configuration
    â”œâ”€â”€ dataset/               # Training data
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test/
    â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/             # Analysis notebooks
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ training.ipynb
    â””â”€â”€ README.md              # Documentation
```

With this library, you can interact with artifacts using familiar file
operations, making it easy to integrate cloud storage into your existing workflows.

HyphaArtifact(
    artifact_id: str,
    workspace: str,
    token: str,
    server_url: str,
    use_proxy: bool,
    use_local_url: bool
)
```

#### File Operations

- **`open(path: str, mode: OpenBinaryMode | OpenTextMode)`** - Open a file for reading/writing
- **`cat(path: str) -> str`** - Read entire file content
- **`ls(path: str, detail: bool = True) -> list`** - List files and directories
- **`exists(path: str) -> bool`** - Check if file exists
- **`copy(source: str, destination: str)`** - Copy a file
- **`rm(path: str)`** - Remove a file

#### Upload Operations

- **`upload(local_path, remote_path="", recursive=True, enable_multipart=False, ...)`**
  - Upload files or folders with multipart support

#### Example Usage

```python
from hypha_artifact import HyphaArtifact

# Initialize artifact
artifact = HyphaArtifact(
    artifact_id="my-data",
    workspace="workspace-123",
    token="token-456",
    server_url="your-server-url"
)

# Stage changes before writing
artifact.edit(stage=True)

# Create a new file
with artifact.open("data.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Important data\nLine 2\nLine 3")

# Commit the changes
artifact.commit(comment="Added data.txt")

# Read partial content
with artifact.open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    first_10_chars = f.read(10)
    print(first_10_chars)  # "Important "

# List all files with details
files = artifact.ls("/", detail=True)
for file_info in files:
    print(f"Name: {file_info['name']}, Size: {file_info.get('size', 'N/A')}")

# List just file names
file_names = artifact.ls("/", detail=False)
print("Files:", file_names)

# Complete workflow
source_file = "source.txt"
backup_file = "backup.txt"

# Stage, create, and commit the source file
artifact.edit(stage=True)
with artifact.open(source_file, "w") as f:
    f.write("This is my source content")
artifact.commit(comment="Created source file")

# Verify and backup
if artifact.exists(source_file):
    artifact.edit(stage=True)
    artifact.copy(source_file, backup_file)
    artifact.commit(comment="Created backup")
    print("Backup created successfully")

# Clean up
artifact.edit(stage=True)
artifact.rm(backup_file)
artifact.commit(comment="Removed backup")

# Upload Operations Examples

# Upload a large file with multipart support
artifact.upload(
    "large_dataset.zip",
    "/datasets/large_dataset.zip",
    enable_multipart=True,
    chunk_size=10*1024*1024  # 10MB chunks
)

# Upload an entire project folder
artifact.upload(
    "./my-project",
    "/projects/my-project",
    recursive=True,
    enable_multipart=True,  # For large files in the folder
    multipart_threshold=50*1024*1024  # 50MB threshold
)
```

### Asynchronous API

The `AsyncHyphaArtifact` class provides asynchronous file operations for better
performance in async applications:

#### Initialization

```python
from hypha_artifact import AsyncHyphaArtifact

async_artifact = AsyncHyphaArtifact(
    artifact_id="my-artifact",
    workspace="workspace-id",
    token="your-token",
    server_url="your-server-url",
    use_proxy=True,
    use_local_url=False,
    disable_ssl=None,
)
```

#### Async File Operations

All methods are async versions of the synchronous API:

- **`await open(path: str, mode: OpenBinaryMode | OpenTextMode)`** - Open a file asynchronously
- **`await cat(path: str) -> str`** - Read entire file content
- **`await ls(path: str, detail: bool = True) -> list`** - List files and directories
- **`await exists(path: str) -> bool`** - Check if file exists
- **`await copy(source: str, destination: str)`** - Copy a file within the artifact
- **`await rm(path: str)`** - Remove a file
- **`await get(remote_path: str, local_path: str, recursive: bool = False)`**
  - Copy from remote to local filesystem
- **`await put(local_path: str, remote_path: str, recursive: bool = False)`**
  - Copy from local to remote filesystem

#### Context Manager Support

```python
import asyncio
from hypha_artifact import AsyncHyphaArtifact

async def main():
    # Method 1: Manual connection management
    artifact = AsyncHyphaArtifact(
        artifact_id="my-workspace/my-artifact",
        token="token",
        workspace="my-workspace",
        server_url="your-server-url"
    )
    
    await artifact.edit(stage=True)
    async with artifact.open("async_file.txt", "w") as f:
        await f.write("Async content")
    await artifact.commit(comment="Added async_file.txt")
    
    content = await artifact.cat("async_file.txt")
    print(content)
    
    # Method 2: Context manager for the entire artifact
    async with AsyncHyphaArtifact(
        artifact_id="my-data",
        workspace="workspace-123",
        token="token-456",
        server_url="your-server-url"
    ) as artifact:
        # Stage, create, and commit
        await artifact.edit(stage=True)
        async with artifact.open("test.txt", "w") as f:
            await f.write("Test content")
        await artifact.commit(comment="Added test.txt")
        
        # List files
        files = await artifact.ls("/")
        print("Files:", [f["name"] for f in files])
        
        # Check existence
        exists = await artifact.exists("test.txt")
        print(f"File exists: {exists}")
        
        # Stage, copy, and commit
await artifact.edit(stage=True)
await artifact.copy("test.txt", "test_copy.txt") 
await artifact.commit(comment="Copied test.txt")

# Stage, remove, and commit
await artifact.edit(stage=True)
await artifact.rm("test_copy.txt")
await artifact.commit(comment="Removed test_copy.txt")
        # Upload large files with parallel multipart support
await artifact.upload(
    "large_model.bin",
    "/models/large_model.bin",
    enable_multipart=True,
    max_parallel_uploads=8,  # Upload parts in parallel
    chunk_size=20*1024*1024  # 20MB chunks
)

# Upload folders with concurrent file uploads
await artifact.upload(
    "./dataset",
    "/data/dataset",
    enable_multipart=True,
    max_parallel_uploads=4
)

# Copy files between local and remote filesystems
# Get a file from remote to local
await artifact.get("remote_file.txt", "local_file.txt")

# Put a file from local to remote
await artifact.edit(stage=True)
await artifact.put("local_file.txt", "remote_file.txt")
await artifact.commit(comment="Uploaded local file")

# Copy directories recursively
await artifact.get("remote_dir", "local_dir", recursive=True)

# Put directory recursively
await artifact.edit(stage=True)
await artifact.put("local_dir", "remote_dir", recursive=True)
await artifact.commit(comment="Uploaded directory")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Async Workflow Example

```python
import asyncio
from hypha_artifact import AsyncHyphaArtifact

async def process_files():
    async with AsyncHyphaArtifact(
        artifact_id="my-data",
        workspace="workspace-123",
        token="token-456",
        server_url="your-server-url"
    ) as artifact:
        
        # Stage changes before creating files
        await artifact.edit(stage=True)

        # Create multiple files concurrently
        tasks = []
        for i in range(5):
            async def create_file(index):
                async with artifact.open(f"file_{index}.txt", "w") as f:
                    await f.write(f"Content for file {index}")
            
            tasks.append(create_file(i))
        
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

        # Commit all changes at once
        await artifact.commit(comment="Added 5 files concurrently")
        
        # List all created files
        files = await artifact.ls("/", detail=False)
        print("Created files:", files)
        
        # Read and process files
        for filename in files:
            if filename.startswith("file_"):
                content = await artifact.cat(filename)
                print(f"{filename}: {content}")

asyncio.run(process_files())
```

## File Transfer Operations

The library provides powerful methods for transferring files between local
filesystems and Hypha artifacts:

### Synchronous File Transfer

```python
from hypha_artifact import HyphaArtifact

artifact = HyphaArtifact(
    artifact_id="my-artifact",
    workspace="workspace",
    token="token",
    server_url="your-server-url"
)

# Copy a single file from remote to local
artifact.get("remote_file.txt", "local_file.txt")

# Copy a single file from local to remote
artifact.edit(stage=True)
artifact.put("local_file.txt", "remote_file.txt")
artifact.commit(comment="Uploaded local file")

# Copy directories recursively
artifact.get("remote_dir", "local_dir", recursive=True)

# Put directory recursively
artifact.edit(stage=True)
artifact.put("local_dir", "remote_dir", recursive=True)
artifact.commit(comment="Uploaded directory")

# Copy multiple files using lists
remote_files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"]
local_files = ["local1.txt", "local2.txt", "local3.txt"]
artifact.get(remote_files, local_files)

# Put multiple files
local_files = ["local1.txt", "local2.txt", "local3.txt"]
remote_files = ["remote1.txt", "remote2.txt", "remote3.txt"]
artifact.edit(stage=True)
artifact.put(local_files, remote_files)
artifact.commit(comment="Uploaded multiple files")
```

### Asynchronous File Transfer

```python
import asyncio
from hypha_artifact import AsyncHyphaArtifact

async def transfer_files():
    async with AsyncHyphaArtifact(
        artifact_id="my-data",
        workspace="workspace-123",
        token="token-456",
        server_url="your-server-url"
    ) as artifact:
        
        # Copy files from remote to local
        await artifact.get("remote_file.txt", "local_file.txt")
        await artifact.get("remote_dir", "local_dir", recursive=True)
        
        # Copy files from local to remote
        await artifact.edit(stage=True)
        await artifact.put("local_file.txt", "remote_file.txt")
        await artifact.put("local_dir", "remote_dir", recursive=True)
        await artifact.commit(comment="Uploaded files")
        
        # Copy multiple files
        remote_files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"]
        local_files = ["local1.txt", "local2.txt"]
        await artifact.get(remote_files, local_files)

asyncio.run(transfer_files())
```

### Advanced Transfer Options

Both `get()` and `put()` methods support additional parameters:

```python
# Error handling
artifact.get(
    "missing_file.txt", "local.txt", on_error="ignore"
)  # Ignore missing files
artifact.get(
    "missing_file.txt", "local.txt", on_error="raise"
)   # Raise errors (default)

# Maximum depth for recursive operations
artifact.get(
    "remote_dir", "local_dir", recursive=True, maxdepth=2
)  # Only 2 levels deep

# Multiple files with error handling
artifact.get(
    ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"], 
    ["local1.txt", "local2.txt"], 
    on_error="ignore"
)
```

### Key Features

- **Binary-safe**: Preserves file content exactly, including binary files
- **Recursive directory copying**: Automatically handles nested directory structures
- **Automatic directory creation**: Creates local directories as needed
- **Multiple file support**: Transfer multiple files with a single call
- **Error handling**: Choose to ignore or raise errors for missing files
- **Depth control**: Limit recursion depth for large directory trees
- **Progress tracking**: Built-in support for monitoring transfer progress

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The `hypha-artifact` package includes a comprehensive CLI tool for managing
artifacts from the command line:

```bash
# Install with CLI support
pip install hypha-artifact

# Upload files and folders
hypha-artifact --artifact-id=my-data upload local-file.txt /remote/path/
hypha-artifact --artifact-id=my-data upload ./my-project /projects/

# List and manage files
hypha-artifact --artifact-id=my-data ls /
hypha-artifact --artifact-id=my-data cat /data.txt
hypha-artifact --artifact-id=my-data rm /old-file.txt

# Large file support with multipart upload
hypha-artifact --artifact-id=my-data upload --enable-multipart large-file.zip /data/
```

For complete CLI documentation including all commands, options, and examples,
see the [CLI Documentation](docs/CLI.md).

## Advanced Usage

### Partial File Reading

Both APIs support reading specific amounts of data:

```python
# Synchronous
with artifact.open("large_file.txt", "r") as f:
    chunk = f.read(1024)  # Read first 1KB

# Asynchronous  
async with artifact.open("large_file.txt", "r") as f:
    chunk = await f.read(1024)  # Read first 1KB
```

### Error Handling

```python
from hypha_artifact import HyphaArtifact

artifact = HyphaArtifact(artifact_id="my-data", workspace="workspace-123",
token="token-456", server_url="your-server-url")

try:
    # Try to read a non-existent file
    content = artifact.cat("non_existent.txt")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error reading file: {e}")

# Always check existence first
if artifact.exists("my_file.txt"):
    content = artifact.cat("my_file.txt")
else:
    print("File not found")
```
