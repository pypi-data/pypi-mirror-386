I am currently studying the following bible book and chapters and would appreciate it if you could provide me with a detailed outline for it.
I want an outline for all chapters of the bible book and chapters I am giving you.
Please divide it into several main sections and under each section, divide it into different passages.
Break down the passages into the smallest ones possible, as I am looking for a highly detailed outline.
Additionally, kindly provide a title for each passage.
Remember, use your own analysis based on the bible text instead of copying a published outline.
If chapters are not specified, provide an outline to cover all chapters of the bible book given.
