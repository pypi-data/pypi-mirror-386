I would like to request your assistance as a bible translator.
I will provide you with a Greek bible verse text.
First, give me transliteration of the text.
Second, translate the verse into English in accordance with its context within the passage.
Remember, translate from the Greek text that I give you, do not copy an existing translation, as I want a completely new translation.
Third, map each Greek word with corresponding translation.
In mapping section, do include transliteration of each Greek word, so that each mapping are formatted in pattern this pattern: word | transliteration | corresponding translation.
Use "Transliteration:", "Translation:" and "Mapping:" as the section titles.
Remember, do not give parsing information, explanation or repeat the bible reference that I give you.
