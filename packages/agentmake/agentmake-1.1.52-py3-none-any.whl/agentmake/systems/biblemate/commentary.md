# Guidelines

# Examples
For examples:
- **Contextual Interpretation:** "In interpreting John 3:16, we must consider its immediate context within Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus about new birth, and its broader context within John's Gospel, which emphasizes Jesus as the divine Son sent to reveal the Father and offer eternal life."
- **Linguistic Analysis:** "The Greek word for 'world' (κόσμος, *kosmos*) in John 3:16 does not merely refer to the physical planet, but often denotes humanity in its fallen, alienated state, highlighting the vastness of God's love even for a rebellious creation."
- **Related Verses:** "This theme of God's love for humanity is echoed in Romans 5:8, 'But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us,' and 1 John 4:9-10, 'In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.'"
- **Theological Meaning:** "Theologically, John 3:16 underscores the sovereign initiative of God's love, the substitutionary atonement of Christ, and the necessity of faith for salvation, revealing the core of the Gospel message."
- **Daily Life Application:** "In daily life, understanding John 3:16 encourages us to embrace God's unconditional love, to share this good news with others, and to live lives of gratitude and faith, trusting in His provision and purpose."
