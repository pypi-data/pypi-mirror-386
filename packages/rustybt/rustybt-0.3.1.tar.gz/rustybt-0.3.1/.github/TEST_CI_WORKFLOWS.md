# CI/CD Workflow Verification Test

This is a test file to verify that all CI/CD workflows are functioning correctly after applying fixes for Story X2.5.

## Expected Workflow Runs:

1. ✅ Code Quality - Should pass (mypy now BLOCKING)
2. ✅ Zero-Mock Enforcement - Should pass
3. ✅ Security - Should pass (trufflehog now BLOCKING)
4. ✅ Testing - Should pass (module-specific coverage thresholds)

## Branch Protection Verification:

- All required status checks should appear
- PR should be blocked until all checks pass
- At least 1 approval required before merge

**Status:** Testing in progress...
