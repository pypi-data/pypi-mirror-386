## Live Trading Documentation - Special Handling

### Why Complete Removal Was Necessary

The live trading README and circuit-breakers documentation contained 10 placeholder violations (71% of Story 10.3 violations) in **safety-critical code**.

**Rationale for removal:**
1. **User Safety:** Placeholder circuit breaker examples could be deployed to production
2. **Financial Risk:** Fake safety code leaves users unprotected
3. **Zero-Mock Policy:** "Remove section or page completely" for placeholders
4. **Better No Docs Than Fake Docs:** Misleading safety documentation is worse than no documentation

### What Replaced It

Created comprehensive cross-reference file pointing to:

**Existing Working Documentation:**
- `docs/guides/broker-setup-guide.md` - Complete broker setup (all 6 brokers including Hyperliquid)
- `docs/guides/websocket-streaming-guide.md` - Real-time data streaming
- `docs/guides/deployment-guide.md` - Production deployment
- `docs/guides/production-checklist.md` - Safety checklist
- `docs/guides/live-vs-backtest-data.md` - Data considerations

**Source Code References:**
- `rustybt/live/brokers/` - All broker adapter implementations
- `rustybt/live/engine.py` - Live trading engine with built-in safety
- `rustybt/live/reconciler.py` - Position reconciliation
- `rustybt/live/state_manager.py` - State persistence

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- ✅ Users have access to REAL, working documentation
- ✅ No misleading placeholder code
- ✅ Clear roadmap for future API reference
- ✅ Maintains zero-mock compliance
- ✅ Addresses user concern about Hyperliquid being findable

## Compliance Verification

### Zero-Mock Enforcement Checklist

**After Remediation:**
- ✅ **No hardcoded return values** - PASS (all `return True # Placeholder` replaced)
- ✅ **No "mock", "fake", "stub", "dummy"** - PASS (all placeholders removed)
- ✅ **All code examples executable** - PASS (placeholder blocks removed)
- ✅ **No TODO/FIXME without tracking** - PASS
- ✅ **Proper error handling** - PASS
- ✅ **Type hints in examples** - PASS

**Result:** 6/6 criteria met (100% compliance) across all three stories

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Documentation Index & Navigation (Pending)
1. [ ] Review API documentation index for completeness
2. [ ] Ensure all broker adapters (including Hyperliquid) are properly referenced
3. [ ] Identify internal documentation (architecture, stories, qa, reviews)
4. [ ] Configure mkdocs.yml to exclude internal docs from search

### Phase 3: Story Updates (Pending)
1. [ ] Update Story 10.2 file with audit findings and remediation
2. [ ] Update Story 10.3 file with audit findings and remediation
3. [ ] Update quality gates to reflect new compliance status

### Phase 4: Long-Term Improvements (Future Sprint)
1. [ ] Rewrite live trading API reference with real broker adapter code
2. [ ] Research transaction cost APIs (borrow, financing) or document why not implemented
3. [ ] Add pre-commit hook to block placeholder patterns
4. [ ] Implement CI/CD documentation validation
