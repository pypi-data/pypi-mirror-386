# Story 8.5: Trade Analysis and Diagnostics

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** quantitative trader,

2. Entry/exit quality analysis (how close to optimal entry/exit points?)
3. Holding period distribution (histogram of trade durations)
4. Win/loss distribution (histogram of trade PnLs)
5. MAE/MFE analysis (Maximum Adverse Excursion / Maximum Favorable Excursion)
6. Trade clustering analysis (are trades concentrated in time/assets?)
7. Slippage analysis (realized slippage vs. expected)
8. Commission impact analysis (how much do fees erode returns?)
9. Tests validate trade analysis with synthetic trade data
10. Visualization of trade patterns (scatter plots, heatmaps)

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- TradeAnalyzer: `rustybt/analytics/trade_analysis.py` (NEW)
- May read from: `rustybt/finance/decimal/transaction.py` (transaction data)

### Tech Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **DataFrames**: **polars** (trade log manipulation)
- **Visualization**: **matplotlib** and **seaborn** (charts)
- **Statistics**: **scipy** (statistical analysis if needed)

### Trade Analysis Methodologies

**1. Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE):**
MAE measures the worst price movement against the trade during its lifetime.
```
MAE = max(entry_price - lowest_price_during_trade) / entry_price  (for longs)
MAE = max(highest_price_during_trade - entry_price) / entry_price  (for shorts)
```

**Use Case:** Setting stop losses
- Plot MAE vs. final PnL
- Optimal stop loss = MAE level that avoids most losing trades but preserves winners

**2. Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE):**
MFE measures the best price movement in favor of the trade.
```
MFE = max(highest_price_during_trade - entry_price) / entry_price  (for longs)
```

**Use Case:** Setting profit targets
- Plot MFE vs. final PnL
- Optimal profit target = MFE level that captures most gains without premature exit

**3. Entry/Exit Quality:**
Measures how close entry/exit prices are to optimal prices in hindsight.
```
Entry Quality = 1 - (actual_entry - optimal_entry) / optimal_entry
Exit Quality = (actual_exit - optimal_exit) / optimal_exit

where:
  optimal_entry = lowest price in N bars before entry
  optimal_exit = highest price in N bars after exit
```

**4. Trade Clustering:**
Identifies whether trades are evenly distributed or concentrated:
- **Time Clustering**: High trading frequency in certain periods
- **Asset Clustering**: Most trades in few assets (concentration risk)

**5. Slippage Analysis:**
```
Realized Slippage = actual_fill_price - expected_price

Expected slippage from model vs. realized slippage
```

- Minimal memory overhead with proper cleanup
- Visualization methods generate plots efficiently

**Scalability:**
