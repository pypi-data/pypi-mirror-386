## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**CI Pipeline Requirements:**
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        python-version: ['3.12', '3.13']

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -e ".[dev]"

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest -v --cov=rustybt --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term

      - name: Type check
        run: |
          mypy --strict rustybt

      - name: Lint
        run: |
          ruff check rustybt

      - name: Format check
        run: |
          black --check rustybt

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          files: ./coverage.xml
```

**Coverage Enforcement:**
- Fail PR if coverage drops below 90%
- Require 95%+ coverage for financial modules
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov
- Coverage badge displayed in README

**Test Execution:**
- Run tests with pytest: `pytest -v --cov=rustybt --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term`
- Parallel execution: `pytest -n auto` (uses pytest-xdist)
- Test timeout: 15 minutes maximum per job

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Code Quality Tools Configuration:**

**black (pyproject.toml):**
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ['py312']
```

**ruff (pyproject.toml):**
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = "py312"
select = ["E", "F", "W", "I", "N", "UP", "ANN", "B", "A", "C4", "DTZ", "T20", "SIM"]

[tool.ruff.lint.mccabe]
max-complexity = 10
```

**mypy (pyproject.toml):**
```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.12"
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true
disallow_incomplete_defs = true
check_untyped_defs = true
disallow_untyped_decorators = true
no_implicit_optional = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
warn_no_return = true
strict_equality = true
strict = true
```

**Coverage.py (pyproject.toml):**
```toml
[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["rustybt"]
omit = ["*/tests/*", "*/testing/*"]

[tool.coverage.report]
fail_under = 90
show_missing = true
exclude_lines = [
    "pragma: no cover",
    "def __repr__",
    "raise AssertionError",
    "raise NotImplementedError",
    "if __name__ == .__main__.:",
]
```

**pytest (pyproject.toml):**
```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_classes = ["Test*"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = "-v --strict-markers --cov=rustybt --cov-report=term-missing"
markers = [
    "slow: marks tests as slow",
    "integration: marks tests as integration tests",
    "benchmark: marks tests as benchmark tests",
]
```

### Zero-Mock Enforcement
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#zero-mock-enforcement-mandatory]

**Pre-Commit Checklist (CI/CD Enforcement):**
- No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments without issue tracking
- No hardcoded return values
- No empty except blocks or pass statements in production code
- No "mock", "fake", "stub", "dummy" in variable/function names (except in tests)
- All tests exercise real functionality

**Automated Enforcement in CI/CD:**
Add additional quality-enforcement job to workflow:
```yaml
jobs:
  zero-mock-enforcement:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Detect mock patterns (BLOCKING)
        run: |
          python scripts/detect_mocks.py --strict

      - name: Validate hardcoded values (BLOCKING)
        run: |
          python scripts/detect_hardcoded_values.py --fail-on-found

      - name: Check validation functions (BLOCKING)
        run: |
          python scripts/verify_validations.py --ensure-real-checks
```

Note: Scripts for zero-mock enforcement (detect_mocks.py, detect_hardcoded_values.py, verify_validations.py) will be implemented in later stories. For Story 1.2, create placeholder scripts or skip these checks until scripts are available.

### GitHub Actions Best Practices
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Caching:**
- Cache pip dependencies to speed up builds
- Cache mypy cache for faster type checking
- Example cache configuration:
```yaml
- name: Cache pip
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('pyproject.toml') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
- Run linting and type checking in parallel with tests
- Use matrix strategy to parallelize platform testing

**Security:**
- Use Codecov token stored in GitHub Secrets
- Limit workflow permissions to minimum required
- Use pinned versions for GitHub Actions

### Branch Protection Configuration
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#code-quality-guardrails-mandatory]

**Required Settings:**
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require CI workflow success
- Require coverage threshold (≥90%)
- Require at least 1 PR approval
- Dismiss stale PR approvals on new commits
- Require linear history (recommended)

**Status Checks:**
- test (all matrix combinations)
- type-check
- lint
- format-check
- coverage

### Codecov Integration
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Setup Steps:**
1. Create Codecov account (https://codecov.io)
2. Link GitHub repository
3. Generate Codecov token
4. Add token to GitHub repository secrets: `CODECOV_TOKEN`
5. Configure coverage upload in workflow
6. Add Codecov badge to README: `[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/{org}/{repo}/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/{org}/{repo})`

**Coverage Thresholds:**
- Overall project: ≥90%
- Financial modules (rustybt/finance/): ≥95%
- New components: ≥90%

- [ ] Consider adding performance benchmarking job for regression detection
- [ ] Consider adding dependency update automation (Dependabot/Renovate)
- [ ] Implement zero-mock enforcement scripts (as noted in story, deferred appropriately)
- [ ] Consider adding automatic PR labeling based on changed files

**Deferred Tasks (Acknowledged in Story):**
- [ ] Branch protection rules configuration (requires GitHub admin access, documented in story)
- [ ] Zero-mock enforcement automation (deferred to future stories per story notes, line 246)

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Organization:**
- Smoke tests in tests/smoke/test_imports.py provide fast validation
- Tests follow mirror structure convention
- Proper use of pytest markers (slow, integration, unit, benchmark)
- conftest.py provides comprehensive test fixtures

**Test Coverage Strategy:**
- Coverage configured at 90% threshold (financial modules would require 95% per standards)
- Proper exclusion of non-testable patterns (pragma: no cover, __repr__, etc.)
- Coverage reports in multiple formats: XML (Codecov), term-missing (console), HTML (debugging)

**Test Execution:**
- Parallel execution via pytest-xdist
- Proper failure limits (--maxfail=50)
- Failed tests run first (--ff flag)
- Slowest tests tracked (--durations=20)

**Test Quality:**
✓ Smoke tests validate critical imports
✓ No mock patterns detected in smoke tests (zero-mock compliant)
✓ Tests exercise real functionality

### Security Review

**Secrets Management:**
- ✓ CODECOV_TOKEN properly managed via GitHub Secrets
- ✓ No hardcoded credentials or tokens detected

**Dependency Security:**
- ✓ safety check integrated (monitors vulnerabilities, non-blocking)
- ✓ bandit SAST integrated (monitors code security issues, non-blocking)

**Supply Chain Security:**
- ✓ GitHub Actions versions pinned (@v4, @v5)
- ✓ uv installed from official astral-sh source
- ✓ Artifact upload standardized on v4 (addressed during review)

**Workflow Security:**
- ✓ Proper permission scoping (read-only defaults)
- ✓ No dynamic code execution from untrusted sources
- ✓ Environment variables properly scoped

### Performance Considerations

**CI/CD Performance:**
- **Excellent**: uv migration reduces dependency installation from minutes to seconds
- **Good**: Smoke test provides feedback in < 5 minutes
- **Good**: Parallel job execution maximizes throughput
- **Good**: Caching strategy reduces redundant work

**Test Performance:**
- **Good**: Parallel test execution with pytest-xdist
- **Good**: Proper timeout configurations prevent hung tests
- **Adequate**: 30-minute timeout for test job (reasonable for full suite)

**Resource Efficiency:**
- **Excellent**: Minimal resource usage with proper caching
- **Good**: Job dependencies prevent unnecessary work
- **Good**: fail-fast: false in matrix ensures complete coverage data

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - **Change**: Standardized GitHub Actions artifact upload to v4 (changed line 156 from `upload-artifact@v3` to `upload-artifact@v4`)
  - **Why**: Supply chain consistency and security - using mixed versions creates unnecessary maintenance burden and potential compatibility issues
  - **How**: Updated the build job's artifact upload action to match the version used in the test job's coverage artifact upload

### Files Modified During Review

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Standardized artifact upload action version

### Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks:**
- **LOW**: Dependency availability (uv is mature, actively maintained)
- **LOW**: Platform compatibility (comprehensive testing on all platforms)
- **LOW**: Breaking changes (proper version pinning mitigates)
- **MEDIUM**: Codecov service dependency (external service, but fail_ci_if_error: false provides resilience)

**Quality Risks:**
- **LOW**: Test reliability (proper timeout and failure handling)
- **LOW**: False positives (non-blocking security checks allow team judgment)
- **LOW**: Coverage accuracy (Coverage.py is mature and reliable)

**Operational Risks:**
- **LOW**: CI/CD pipeline failure (proper error handling and artifacts)
- **LOW**: Maintenance burden (clean, well-documented configuration)
- **MEDIUM**: Branch protection not configured (requires manual setup by admin)

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.2-configure-cicd-pipeline.yml

**Reasoning:** All 8 acceptance criteria are fully implemented with production-grade quality. The CI/CD pipeline demonstrates excellent architecture, comprehensive quality gates, and proper NFR coverage. Branch protection rules task is appropriately deferred (requires GitHub admin access). Zero-mock enforcement is properly noted as future work.

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done**

The story is complete and production-ready. The implementation exceeds baseline requirements with modern tooling (uv), comprehensive testing, and proper quality gates. The deferred branch protection configuration is documented and can be completed by a repository administrator as a quick administrative task.

**Next Steps:**
1. Repository administrator should configure branch protection rules per story documentation
2. Consider the future enhancement recommendations in subsequent sprints
3. Monitor CI/CD performance metrics to validate uv performance improvements
