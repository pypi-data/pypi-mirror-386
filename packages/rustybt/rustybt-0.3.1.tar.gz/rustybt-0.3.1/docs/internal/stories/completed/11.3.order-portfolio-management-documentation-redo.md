## Story

**As a** trader or strategy developer,
**I want** production-grade documentation of all order types, execution systems, and portfolio management with verified usage patterns and tested examples,
**So that** I can confidently use the framework's trading capabilities without encountering incorrect usage, non-functional examples, or non-existent order types.

## Story Context

**Epic**: Epic 11 - Documentation Quality Framework & Epic 10 Complete Redo
**Story Type**: Documentation Redo (replaces Story 10.2)
**Prerequisites**: Story 11.1 MUST be complete
**Estimated Effort**: 15-25 hours (Weeks 5-6)

**Why This Story Exists (Course Change Context)**:
- Original Story 10.2 marked complete but had **CRITICAL quality issues**
- **THREE FABRICATED ORDER TYPES** documented (TWAP, VWAP, Iceberg) that don't exist
- Story 10.X1 removed fabricated types but didn't address usage validation
- Examples not tested, API usage patterns not validated
- **This is a complete redo with EXTRA VIGILANCE for order types**

**What's Different This Time**:
- MANDATORY: Verify EVERY order type exists in `rustybt/finance/execution.py`
- MANDATORY: Check PRD out-of-scope section before documenting
- MANDATORY: Test ALL examples before documenting
- MANDATORY: NO aspirational documentation
- MANDATORY: Framework expert written approval

**⚠️ CRITICAL LESSON FROM STORY 10.2**:
**Story 10.2 documented TWAP, VWAP, and Iceberg order types that DO NOT EXIST in the framework. These are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE per PRD. This mistake MUST NOT be repeated.**

**READ BEFORE STARTING**:
1. `prd/epic-11-documentation-quality-framework-and-epic10-redo.md`
2. `qa/SPRINT_CHANGE_PROPOSAL_EPIC10_COMPLETE_REDO.md`
3. `qa/SPRINT_CHANGE_PROPOSAL_EPIC10_DOCUMENTATION_INTEGRITY.md` (Story 10.2 issues)
4. `stories/10.X1.audit-and-remediate-epic10-fabricated-apis.md`
5. `api/order-management/CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md` (what was removed)
6. `DOCUMENTATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`
7. `DOCUMENTATION_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md`
8. `DOCUMENTATION_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PRE-FLIGHT: Verify Order Types Against Source

**BEFORE documenting ANY order type, verify it exists:**

**Implemented Order Types** (verified in `rustybt/finance/execution.py`):
- ✅ MarketOrder (line 64)
- ✅ LimitOrder (line 81)
- ✅ StopOrder (line 111)
- ✅ StopLimitOrder (line 142)
- ✅ TrailingStopOrder (line 219)
- ✅ OCOOrder (line 318)
- ✅ BracketOrder (line 359)

**OUT OF SCOPE** (per PRD, line 74 - DO NOT DOCUMENT):
- ❌ TWAPOrder - DOES NOT EXIST
- ❌ VWAPOrder - DOES NOT EXIST
- ❌ IcebergOrder - DOES NOT EXIST
- ❌ Any algorithmic execution orders - OUT OF SCOPE

**Verification Process**:
1. Open `rustybt/finance/execution.py`
2. Search for class definition (e.g., `class LimitOrder`)
3. Confirm line number and implementation
4. Note source location in documentation
5. **If NOT found, DO NOT document**

**If you're tempted to document an order type "because it should exist":**
**STOP. Check source code. If it doesn't exist, DON'T document it.**

## Quality Framework Compliance (Epic 11)

### Pre-Flight Checklist (BEFORE Starting)
**Location**: `docs/internal/story-artifacts/11.3-preflight-checklist.md`

**MUST Complete ALL Sections** + Story-Specific Items:
1. Framework Knowledge Verification
2. Source Code Analysis (**EXTRA**: Verify all order types in source)
3. Testing Preparation
4. Reference Material (**EXTRA**: Review Story 10.2 corrections)
5. Quality Framework Understanding
6. Epic 11 Specific - Course Change Context (**EXTRA**: Review Story 10.2 failures)
7. Resource Availability

**Story 11.3 Specific Pre-Flight Items**:
- [x] I have opened `rustybt/finance/execution.py` and verified all order type classes
- [x] I have checked PRD out-of-scope section (line 74: algorithmic orders OUT OF SCOPE)
- [x] I have read `api/order-management/CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md` (what was removed in Story 10.X1)
- [x] I understand that TWAP, VWAP, Iceberg DO NOT EXIST and must NOT be documented
- [x] I commit to verifying EVERY order type before documenting

**Submission**: With first commit or at story kickoff

---

### During Documentation Creation

**Continuous Requirements**:
- Verify order type in source before documenting
- Test each example immediately after writing
- Run `verify_documented_apis.py` frequently
- Check against PRD out-of-scope list

**Prohibited Actions** ❌:
- Documenting order types without source verification
- Copying from archived docs (especially order-types.md)
- Aspirational documentation ("it should exist")
- Documenting algorithmic orders (out of scope)

**Required Actions** ✅:
- Check `rustybt/finance/execution.py` for every order type
- Test order submission in actual framework
- Verify order lifecycle works as documented
- Cross-reference with PRD scope

---

### Story 10.2 Mistakes to Avoid ⚠️ CRITICAL

**What Went Wrong in Story 10.2**:
1. **Fabricated THREE order types** (TWAP, VWAP, Iceberg) that don't exist
2. **Documented out-of-scope features** as if they were implemented
3. **No source code verification** - assumed orders existed
4. **Examples couldn't work** because classes don't exist

**How to Avoid Repeating**:
1. ✅ **VERIFY order type exists** in `rustybt/finance/execution.py` BEFORE documenting
2. ✅ **CHECK PRD out-of-scope** section before documenting any algorithmic order
3. ✅ **TEST import** for every order type before documenting
4. ✅ **NO aspirational docs** - only document what exists today
5. ❌ **DON'T assume** an order "should" exist - verify it does

**If You're Unsure**:
- Open source file: `rustybt/finance/execution.py`
- Search for class: `class [OrderType]`
- If NOT found: DO NOT document
- If found: Note line number, verify parameters

## Risk and Mitigation

### PRIMARY RISK: Repeating Story 10.2 Mistake ⚠️
**Impact**: CRITICAL (would invalidate entire story)
**Mitigation**:
- Pre-flight includes explicit order type verification
- Validation checklist includes order type cross-check
- Expert review specifically validates order types
- Multiple checkpoints prevent fabricated documentation

### Secondary Risk: Aspirational Documentation
**Impact**: HIGH (documenting what "should" exist vs what does)
**Mitigation**:
- Check PRD out-of-scope before documenting
- Verify in source code, not assumptions
- Test imports for everything
- Expert review catches aspirational content

---

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites**:
- **Story 11.1 MUST be complete** (quality framework)
- Quality standards established
- Checklists available
- Automation scripts operational

**Blocks**: No other stories blocked by this one

**Related Stories**:
- Story 10.2 (original - archived, DO NOT COPY FROM)
- Story 10.X1 (removed fabricated orders)
- Story 11.1 (quality framework - prerequisite)
- Story 11.2 (can run in parallel if resources available)
- Story 11.4 (can start after 11.3)

---

## Course Change Reminders for Implementer

### What Went Wrong in Story 10.2 ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Fabricated THREE order types** that don't exist
- Documented TWAP, VWAP, Iceberg (all out of scope)
- No source code verification performed
- Aspirational documentation ("should exist" vs "does exist")

### How to Avoid Repeating ✅
- Open `rustybt/finance/execution.py` BEFORE documenting any order
- Check PRD out-of-scope section (line 74)
- Test imports for every order type
- NO assumptions - only facts
- When in doubt, ask expert

### Verification Checklist for Order Types
**For EACH order type you want to document**:
1. [x] Open `rustybt/finance/execution.py`
2. [x] Search for `class [OrderTypeName]`
3. [x] Confirm class exists (note line number)
4. [x] Test import: `from rustybt.finance.execution import [OrderTypeName]`
5. [x] Document source location
6. [x] ONLY THEN document the order type

**If class NOT found**:
- DO NOT document
- Check PRD to see if it's out of scope
- DO NOT create "Not Yet Implemented" section
- DO NOT document with "will be available in future"

### Epic 11 Quality Mindset
**"Do it right the second time, not the third time."**

Story 10.2 made a critical mistake. This is our chance to do it right.

- Verify EVERYTHING in source code
- NO aspirational documentation
- Test imports BEFORE documenting
- Expert review BEFORE completion
