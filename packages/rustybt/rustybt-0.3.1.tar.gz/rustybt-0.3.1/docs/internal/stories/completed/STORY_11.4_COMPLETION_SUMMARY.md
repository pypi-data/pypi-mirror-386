## Risks & Mitigations

### Identified Risks: NONE CRITICAL

**Minor Observations** (not risks):
1. Some examples use placeholder functions (e.g., `run_backtest()`)
   - **Assessment**: Acceptable - focuses on API usage, not implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Not needed - this is standard documentation practice

2. Live trading docs heavily emphasize safety
   - **Assessment**: EXCELLENT - appropriate for safety-critical systems
   - **Mitigation**: Continue this emphasis in future documentation
