- **LOC:** ~40,000 lines of code across 12 major modules

**Module Structure:**

| Module | Purpose | Key Files |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **algorithm** | Core algorithm execution engine | `algorithm.py` (2,800 LOC, TradingAlgorithm class) |

**Preserved Zipline Modules:**
- `algorithm.py`: Extended with live trading hooks
- `assets/`: Extended with cryptocurrency support
- `data/bundles/`: Extended with Parquet support
- `pipeline/`: Extended with Polars compatibility
- `utils/`: Extended with additional utilities

### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Coverage Analysis:**
- Overall: 88.26% baseline (target: ≥90%)
- Financial modules: Target ≥95% for new code
- Run coverage: `pytest tests/ --cov=zipline --cov-report=html --cov-report=term`

**Coverage Heatmap Creation:**
- Generate HTML coverage report: `pytest tests/ --cov=zipline --cov-report=html`
- Open htmlcov/index.html to view per-file coverage
- Extract per-module coverage percentages
- Create table showing coverage by module for quick reference

**Safe Modification Zones:**
- High coverage (≥90%): Safe to extend, tests will catch regressions
- Medium coverage (70-90%): Moderate risk, add tests for modified areas
- Low coverage (<70%): High risk, add comprehensive tests before modifying

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Architecture documentation in docs/architecture/
- Use Mermaid or PlantUML for diagrams
- Document integration points between components
- Include code snippets for extension examples

**Diagram Tools:**
- Mermaid: Markdown-based diagrams (renders in GitHub)
- PlantUML: More complex diagrams (requires separate rendering)
- Example Mermaid syntax:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[MinuteSimulationClock] --> B[AlgorithmSimulator]
    B --> C[TradingAlgorithm]
    C --> D[User Strategy]
    B --> E[MetricsTracker]
    B --> F[Blotter]
