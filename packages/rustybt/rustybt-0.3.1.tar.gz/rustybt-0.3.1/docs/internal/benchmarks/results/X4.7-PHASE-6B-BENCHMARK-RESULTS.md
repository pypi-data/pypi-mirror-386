# Story X4.7 Phase 6B - Benchmark Results Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Branch:** X4.7-phase-6b-heavy-operations
**Status:** 2 of 4 optimizations evaluated, 1 ACCEPTED, 1 REJECTED

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 6B heavy operations optimization evaluation completed for 2 of 4 planned optimizations:
- **PersistentWorkerPool:** ✅ **ACCEPTED** with **74.97% speedup** (6.8x better than 11% expectation)
- **SharedBundleContext:** ❌ **REJECTED** due to architectural incompatibility (non-picklable sqlite3 connections)

**Current Progress:** 74.97% cumulative speedup achieved, need 15.03% more to reach 90% goal.

## 1. PersistentWorkerPool - ✅ ACCEPTED

─────────────────────────────────────────
Baseline (Standard Pool)  14.685s ± 0.115s
Optimized (Persistent)     3.675s ± 0.130s
Speedup                   74.97%
95% Confidence Interval   [74.32%, 75.63%]
t-statistic              207.9495
p-value                   < 0.000001
Statistical Significance  ✅ YES (p < 0.05)
```

### Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Required | Actual | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Min runs | ≥10 | 10 | ✅ PASS |
| 95% CI calculated | Yes | [74.32%, 75.63%] | ✅ PASS |
| Statistical significance | p < 0.05 | p < 0.000001 | ✅ PASS |
| Min speedup | ≥5% | 74.97% | ✅ PASS |
| Functional equivalence | Validated | 14/14 tests passing | ✅ PASS |

### Why It Exceeded Expectations

**Expected:** 11% (based on process startup overhead estimation)
**Actual:** 74.97% (6.8x better)

**Root Cause:** Original estimate only considered process creation overhead (50-200ms per worker). Actual measurement reveals bundle loading is far more expensive:
- Parquet file discovery and metadata loading
- SQLite connection initialization
- Asset finder initialization
- Trading calendar loading

Worker reuse eliminates **ALL** initialization overhead, not just process startup.

### Implementation Details

- **File:** `rustybt/optimization/persistent_worker_pool.py`
- **Tests:** `tests/optimization/test_persistent_worker_pool.py` (14 tests, ALL PASSING)
- **Benchmark:** `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_phase6b_persistent_pool.py`
- **Configuration:** Added `enable_persistent_worker_pool` flag to `OptimizationConfig`
- **Environment Variable:** `RUSTYBT_ENABLE_PERSISTENT_POOL=true`

### Integration

```python
from rustybt.optimization.config import OptimizationConfig

config = OptimizationConfig.create_default()
config.enable_persistent_worker_pool = True  # Enable optimization
```

---

## 2. SharedBundleContext - ❌ REJECTED

### Rejection Reason

**Architectural Incompatibility:** Bundle data structure contains non-picklable `sqlite3.Connection` objects, preventing serialization to shared memory.

```python
# Error encountered:
TypeError: cannot pickle 'sqlite3.Connection' object
```

### Technical Analysis

Current `BundleData` structure:
```python
BundleData(
    asset_finder=...,        # Contains sqlite3.Connection
    adjustment_reader=...,   # Contains sqlite3.Connection
    equity_daily_bar_reader=...,
    equity_minute_bar_reader=...,
)
```

SQLite connections are used throughout for:
- Asset metadata queries
- Adjustment data access
- Symbology lookups

These connections **cannot be pickled** for shared memory without significant architectural refactoring.

### Decision

**REJECTED** per Story X4.7 AC#1: "Functional equivalence validated BEFORE performance measurement (BLOCKING)."

Since the optimization cannot achieve functional equivalence (fails at serialization stage), performance benchmarking was not executed.

### Future Considerations

Potential approaches for future work:
1. Refactor bundle architecture to separate picklable data from connections
2. Implement lazy connection initialization per worker
3. Use memory-mapped files for asset metadata instead of SQLite

**Estimated Effort:** High (requires core bundle infrastructure redesign)
**Priority:** Low (Phase 6B already achieving strong results without this optimization)

## Benchmark Configuration

### Test Environment

```
Bundle:       mag-7 (real yfinance data)
Symbols:      8 (AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, AVGO, META, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA)
Rows:         40,987 OHLCV bars
Date Range:   2000-01-03 to 2024-12-31
Workers:      8 processes
Runs:         10 (for statistical significance)
```

### Zero-Mock Enforcement

✅ **ALL real data and implementations:**
- Real yfinance bundle data (mag-7)
- Real bundle loading operations
- Real multiprocessing worker creation
- Real computation tasks
- No mocks, stubs, or simulated data

### Statistical Validation

All benchmarks follow Epic X4 NFR-004 requirements:
- ≥10 benchmark runs
- 95% confidence intervals calculated
- p < 0.05 statistical significance threshold
- Paired t-tests for baseline vs optimized comparison

## Sequential Evaluation Status

### Optimizations Evaluated (2/4)

1. ~~SharedBundleContext (Rank #1)~~ - ❌ REJECTED (0%)
2. **PersistentWorkerPool (Rank #5)** - ✅ ACCEPTED (74.97%)
3. BOHB Optimizer (Rank #3) - Pending (40% expected)
4. Ray Scheduler (Rank #4) - Pending (10% expected)

### Cumulative Progress

```
Current:    74.97%
Goal:       90.00%
Remaining:  15.03%
```

### Next Steps

**Option 1: Continue Sequential Evaluation**
- Implement and benchmark BOHB Optimizer (Rank #3, 40% expected)
- If accepted, goal achieved (74.97% + 40% > 90%)
- Implement Ray Scheduler only if BOHB rejected

**Option 2: Stop Evaluation**
- 74.97% already significant improvement
- Close to 90% goal (84% of target achieved)
- Consider stopping with current results

**Recommendation:** Continue with BOHB evaluation (Rank #3) as it has highest expected impact (40%) and could single-handedly push cumulative speedup past 90% goal.

## Commits

1. **f73a289** - feat(X4.7): Implement SharedBundleContext and PersistentWorkerPool optimizations
2. **a5f42e3** - feat(X4.7): Complete Phase 6B benchmarks with real data - PersistentWorkerPool ACCEPTED (74.97%)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **ACCEPT** PersistentWorkerPool optimization
2. ✅ **DOCUMENT** acceptance/rejection decisions (completed)
3. ✅ **UPDATE** Story X4.7 with results (completed)

### Next Phase

**Proceed with BOHB Optimizer (Rank #3):**
- Expected: 40% improvement
- Library: `hpbandster>=0.7.4`
- Implementation: `rustybt/optimization/bohb_optimizer.py`
- Multi-fidelity budget allocation using backtest data subsets
- If accepted, cumulative speedup would exceed 90% goal

### Alternative: Stop Evaluation

**Arguments for stopping:**
- 74.97% is significant improvement
- Close to 90% goal (84% achievement)
- SharedBundleContext rejection shows architectural limitations
- Diminishing returns may apply to remaining optimizations

**Arguments for continuing:**
- BOHB has high expected impact (40%)
- Single acceptance could push past goal
- Sequential evaluation framework requires checking all ranked optimizations
- Story AC requires reaching 90% or detecting diminishing returns

**Decision:** Recommend continuing with BOHB evaluation.

---

## Conclusion

Phase 6B sequential evaluation successfully completed first 2 optimizations:
- **PersistentWorkerPool:** Outstanding success (74.97% vs 11% expected)
- **SharedBundleContext:** Rejected due to architectural constraints

Current cumulative speedup of **74.97%** puts Phase 6B at **84% of the 90% goal**. Recommend proceeding with BOHB Optimizer evaluation as it has potential to push cumulative speedup past target with single acceptance.

All benchmarks conducted with **real yfinance data** (mag-7 bundle), **zero mocks**, and proper **statistical validation** (≥10 runs, 95% CI, p<0.05).
