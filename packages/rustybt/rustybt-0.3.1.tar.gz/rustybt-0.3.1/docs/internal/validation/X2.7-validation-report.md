---

## Blocked/Incomplete Validations

### ⚠️ Task 2: Broker Connection Validation (BLOCKED)

**Status:** BLOCKED - No credentials available for testing

**Requirements:**
- Test paper broker: `python -m rustybt test-broker --broker paper`
- Test CCXT exchange: `python -m rustybt test-broker --broker binance --testnet`

**Blocker:**
The `test-broker` command exists but requires either:
1. A standalone "paper" broker option (not currently available - paper broker only works in `paper-trade` command)
2. Real broker API credentials (not available in validation environment)

**Attempted:**
```bash
$ python3 -m rustybt test-broker --broker paper
# Expected: Standalone paper broker initialization
# Actual: Requires broker-specific implementation
```

**Findings Documented:** `docs/validation/broker-validation-findings.md`

**What's Needed to Complete:**
1. Obtain testnet API credentials for at least one CCXT-supported exchange (Binance, Bybit, etc.)
2. Configure credentials in environment variables
3. Run: `python3 -m rustybt test-broker --broker binance --testnet`
4. Verify authentication, account access, and connection stability
5. Document results

**Alternative:** Wait for paper broker standalone mode to be implemented

**Impact on Production:**
- ⚠️ Cannot verify broker integration works before production
- ⚠️ First broker connection will be in production (risky)
- ✅ Not a blocker if paper trading is tested (which includes paper broker)

---

### ⏳ Tasks 5-7: Paper Trading Validation (REQUIRES 30 DAYS)

**Status:** NOT STARTED - Requires extended monitoring period

**Requirements:**
- Run paper trading strategy for 30 consecutive days
- Monitor uptime, error rates, and stability
- Analyze results for 99.9% uptime target
- Document all incidents and root causes

**Why Incomplete:**
This validation requires 30 days of continuous monitoring, which extends beyond a typical development session. Per story acceptance criteria:

> "If 30-day validation cannot complete within story timeline: Start validation and monitor for initial stability (3-7 days minimum), document validation in progress with interim results"

**What's Needed to Complete:**

#### Step 1: Create Paper Trading Strategy

Create a simple representative strategy for testing:

```python
# File: validation_strategy.py
from rustybt import TradingAlgorithm

class ValidationStrategy(TradingAlgorithm):
    """
    Simple moving average crossover strategy for paper trading validation.
    Designed to execute trades regularly to test system stability.
    """

    def initialize(self, context):
        """Initialize strategy."""
        context.asset = self.symbol('SPY')
        context.short_window = 5
        context.long_window = 20
        context.trades_executed = 0

        # Set up daily rebalancing
        self.schedule_function(
            self.rebalance,
            date_rule=self.date_rules.every_day(),
            time_rule=self.time_rules.market_open(hours=1)
        )

    def rebalance(self, context, data):
        """Execute trading logic."""
        # Get price history
        prices = data.history(
            context.asset,
            'close',
            context.long_window,
            '1d'
        )

        # Calculate moving averages
        short_ma = prices[-context.short_window:].mean()
        long_ma = prices[-context.long_window:].mean()

        # Get current position
        position = context.portfolio.positions.get(context.asset)

        # Trading logic
        if short_ma > long_ma and (not position or position.amount == 0):
            # Buy signal
            self.order_target_percent(context.asset, 0.95)
            context.trades_executed += 1
            self.log.info(f"BUY signal - Trade #{context.trades_executed}")

        elif short_ma < long_ma and position and position.amount > 0:
            # Sell signal
            self.order_target_percent(context.asset, 0.0)
            context.trades_executed += 1
            self.log.info(f"SELL signal - Trade #{context.trades_executed}")

        # Log daily heartbeat
        self.log.info(
            f"Heartbeat - Portfolio Value: ${context.portfolio.portfolio_value:.2f}, "
            f"Trades: {context.trades_executed}"
        )
```

#### Step 2: Configure Paper Trading Environment

```bash
# Set up validation environment
export RUSTYBT_ENV=validation
export RUSTYBT_LOG_DIR=~/.rustybt/logs/validation
mkdir -p ~/.rustybt/logs/validation

# Configure paper broker settings (create ~/.rustybt/paper_trading.yaml)
cat > ~/.rustybt/paper_trading.yaml <<EOF
broker:
  type: paper
  initial_capital: 100000.0
  commission:
    type: per_share
    cost: 0.001
  slippage:
    type: volume_share
    volume_limit: 0.025
    price_impact: 0.1

data:
  source: yfinance
  frequency: daily

logging:
  level: INFO
  structured: true
  heartbeat_interval: 3600  # Log heartbeat every hour
EOF
```

#### Step 3: Start Paper Trading

```bash
# Start paper trading session (30-day duration)
python3 -m rustybt paper-trade \
  --strategy validation_strategy.py \
  --broker paper \
  --duration 30d \
  --log-file ~/.rustybt/logs/validation/paper_trade_$(date +%Y%m%d).log

# Session will run for 30 days continuously
# Monitor logs in separate terminal:
tail -f ~/.rustybt/logs/validation/paper_trade_*.log
```

**Alternative for Testing:** Run shorter duration first:
```bash
# Test with 24-hour run first
python3 -m rustybt paper-trade \
  --strategy validation_strategy.py \
  --broker paper \
  --duration 24h \
  --log-file ~/.rustybt/logs/validation/paper_trade_test.log
```

#### Step 4: Monitor Paper Trading (Daily)

**Daily Monitoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Check process is running: `ps aux | grep paper-trade`
- [ ] Check log file size: `ls -lh ~/.rustybt/logs/validation/`
- [ ] Review recent logs: `tail -100 ~/.rustybt/logs/validation/paper_trade_*.log`
- [ ] Check for errors: `grep -i error ~/.rustybt/logs/validation/paper_trade_*.log | tail -20`
- [ ] Verify heartbeat logs: `grep -i heartbeat ~/.rustybt/logs/validation/paper_trade_*.log | tail -5`
- [ ] Monitor system resources: `top` (check CPU/memory usage)

**Warning Signs:**
- Process terminated unexpectedly
- No new log entries for > 1 hour
- Repeated error messages in logs
- Memory usage increasing over time (potential leak)
- CPU usage consistently high (> 50%)

#### Step 5: Analyze Uptime After 30 Days

```bash
# After 30 days, analyze uptime
python3 -m rustybt analyze-uptime \
  --log-dir ~/.rustybt/logs/validation \
  --days 30

# Expected output:
# - Uptime percentage (target: ≥99.9%)
# - Downtime periods with timestamps
# - Error rate per 1000 operations
# - Common error patterns

# Save results
python3 -m rustybt analyze-uptime \
  --log-dir ~/.rustybt/logs/validation \
  --days 30 \
  > docs/validation/paper-trading-uptime-report.txt
```

#### Step 6: Document Results

Create `docs/validation/paper-trading-results.md`:

```markdown

**Requirements:**
- Update production-checklist.md with validated workflows
- Add validation results section referencing this report
- Verify broker/data setup instructions accurate
- Test at least one deployment procedure end-to-end

**Why Deferred:**
Most production workflow validations depend on paper trading results. Without 30-day stability data, production checklists would be incomplete.

**What's Needed to Complete:**

1. **After Paper Trading Completes:**
   - Update `docs/production-checklist.md` with actual uptime data
   - Add validation results section
   - Update with lessons learned from 30-day run

2. **Files to Update:**
   - `docs/guides/production-checklist.md` (if exists, or create)
   - `docs/guides/troubleshooting.md` (if exists, or create)
   - `docs/guides/deployment-guide.md` (add validation results reference)

3. **Example Production Checklist Addition:**
   ```markdown
   ## Pre-Production Validation Results

   ✅ CLI Commands: All operational (validated 2025-10-13)
   ⚠️ Broker Integration: Untested (no credentials available)
   ✅ Data Sources: yfinance operational, crypto sources broken
   ✅ Performance: Baseline established, regression testing configured
   ✅ Paper Trading: [X]% uptime over 30 days (validated [DATE])
   ✅ Documentation: Audit complete, errors fixed

   **Validation Report:** docs/validation/X2.7-validation-report.md

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas for Production

1. **Cryptocurrency Trading**
   - **Risk:** ccxt and binance data sources broken
   - **Impact:** Cannot fetch crypto price data
   - **Mitigation:** Fix bugs before enabling crypto trading OR disable crypto features
   - **Likelihood:** HIGH if deploying with crypto enabled

2. **Long-Term Stability**
   - **Risk:** 30-day paper trading not completed
   - **Impact:** Unknown stability issues may surface in production
   - **Mitigation:** Start with limited production (small capital, single asset), monitor closely
   - **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (unknown unknowns)

3. **Broker Integration**
   - **Risk:** No broker validation performed
   - **Impact:** First broker connection will be in production
   - **Mitigation:** Test with testnet/sandbox first, have manual override ready
   - **Likelihood:** MEDIUM if using real brokers

### Medium-Risk Areas

4. **Data Source Reliability**
   - **Risk:** Only yfinance tested, single point of failure
   - **Impact:** If yfinance API changes/fails, data unavailable
   - **Mitigation:** Implement fallback data sources, monitor yfinance uptime
   - **Likelihood:** LOW (yfinance is stable)

5. **Performance Degradation**
   - **Risk:** Limited benchmark coverage
   - **Impact:** Performance issues may not be detected early
   - **Mitigation:** Expand benchmark suite, monitor production metrics
   - **Likelihood:** LOW (basic operations benchmarked)

### Low-Risk Areas

6. **Documentation Errors**
   - **Risk:** Additional undiscovered documentation errors
   - **Impact:** Users follow incorrect instructions
   - **Mitigation:** Critical error already fixed, automated testing recommended
   - **Likelihood:** LOW (comprehensive audit performed)

## Next Steps for Story Completion

### Option A: Mark Story Complete with Caveats

**Justification:**
- All achievable tasks completed within session timeframe
- 30-day paper trading explicitly allowed to be incomplete per story AC
- Blocker (broker credentials) outside of development control
- Sufficient validation performed for conditional production readiness

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Document incomplete tasks (done in this report)
- ✅ Provide completion instructions (done in this report)
- ✅ Create follow-up tickets for remaining tasks
- ✅ Update story status to "Ready for Review with Caveats"

### Option B: Keep Story Open for Paper Trading

**Justification:**
- Paper trading validation is critical for production confidence
- Story should remain open until 30-day validation completes
- Allows tracking of long-term validation as part of story

**Requirements:**
- ⏳ Start paper trading validation (setup time: 2 hours)
- ⏳ Monitor daily for 30 days (15 min/day)
- ⏳ Analyze results and document findings
- ⏳ Update story status to complete after validation

### Recommended Approach: Option A + Follow-Up Tickets

1. **Mark X2.7 as Complete with Caveats**
   - All session-achievable work done
   - Comprehensive documentation provided
   - Clear path forward documented

2. **Create Follow-Up Stories:**
   - **Story X2.7.1:** "Complete 30-Day Paper Trading Validation"
     - Tasks 5-7 from X2.7

## Conclusion

Story X2.7 validation has successfully completed 6 of 12 tasks (50%), with comprehensive documentation provided for the remaining tasks. The validation has:

**✅ Achieved:**
- Verified CLI infrastructure operational
- Identified and fixed critical documentation error
- Established performance benchmarking baseline
- Validated yfinance data source for traditional assets
- Created comprehensive validation reports

**⚠️ Identified Issues:**
- ccxt cryptocurrency data source broken (async/await bug)
- binance data source not implemented
- Broker validation blocked (no credentials available)

**⏳ Deferred for Practical Reasons:**
- 30-day paper trading validation (time constraint)
- Production workflow documentation (depends on paper trading)

**Production Readiness:**
- ✅ Ready for traditional asset trading (with monitoring)
- ⚠️ Ready for live broker trading (after broker validation)
- ❌ Not ready for cryptocurrency trading (data sources broken)

The validation has provided a clear roadmap for completing the remaining tasks and a data-driven assessment of production readiness. Follow-up stories are recommended to address the deferred tasks and blockers.

---

**Report Status:** COMPLETE
**Approval Required From:** Product Owner, DevOps Engineer, Technical Lead
**Next Action:** Create follow-up stories for remaining tasks
