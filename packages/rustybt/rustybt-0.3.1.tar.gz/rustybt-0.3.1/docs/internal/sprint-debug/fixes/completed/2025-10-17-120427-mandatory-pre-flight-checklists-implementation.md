# [2025-10-17 12:04:27] - Mandatory Pre-Flight Checklists Implementation

**Focus Area:** Documentation (Sprint Debugging Process)

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

### For Documentation Updates: Pre-Flight Checklist

- [x] **Content verified in source code**
  - [x] Located source implementation: `docs/internal/stories/11.4-preflight-checklist.md`
  - [x] Confirmed functionality exists as will be documented
  - [x] Understand actual behavior (pre-flight checklist from Story 11.4)

- [x] **Technical accuracy verified**
  - [x] ALL code examples tested and working (N/A - process documentation)
  - [x] ALL API signatures match source code exactly (N/A - process documentation)
  - [x] ALL import paths tested and working (N/A - process documentation)
  - [x] NO fabricated content - adapted from proven Story 11.4 checklist

- [x] **Example quality verified**
  - [x] Examples use realistic data (template examples are realistic)
  - [x] Examples are copy-paste executable (template is copy-paste ready)
  - [x] Examples demonstrate best practices (follows Story 11.4 proven approach)
  - [x] Complex examples include explanatory comments (inline documentation provided)

- [x] **Quality standards compliance**
  - [x] Read `DOCUMENTATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`
  - [x] Read `coding-standards.md` (for code examples)
  - [x] Commit to zero documentation debt
  - [x] Will NOT use syntax inference without verification

- [x] **Cross-references and context**
  - [x] Identified related documentation to update (README.md, fixes.md)
  - [x] Checked for outdated information (verified current state)
  - [x] Verified terminology consistency (matches Story 11.4 terminology)
  - [x] No broken links (all references valid)

- [x] **Testing preparation**
  - [x] Testing environment ready (documentation only - no code testing needed)
  - [x] Test data available and realistic (template structure validated)
  - [x] Can validate documentation builds (markdown syntax validated)

**Documentation Pre-Flight Complete**: [x] YES [ ] NO

**Issues Found:**
1. No mandatory pre-flight process for sprint debugging fixes - `docs/internal/sprint-debug/fixes.md`
2. Risk of repeating Epic 10 quality issues without systematic checks
3. No framework code update checklist equivalent to documentation checklist

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Why did this issue occur: Initial sprint-debug setup focused on tracking but not prevention
- What pattern should prevent recurrence: Mandatory pre-flight checklists before all fixes ensure quality gates

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Embedded mandatory pre-flight checklists in fixes.md template** - `docs/internal/sprint-debug/fixes.md`
   - Added Documentation Updates pre-flight checklist (adapted from Story 11.4)
   - Added Framework Code Updates pre-flight checklist (based on coding standards)
   - Made checklists part of batch template (can't skip)
   - Added root cause analysis requirement to template

2. **Updated sprint-debug workflow in README** - `docs/internal/sprint-debug/README.md`
   - Added Step 2: Mandatory Pre-Flight Checklist
   - Documented both checklist types with key points
   - Updated verification checklist to include pre-flight completion
   - Renumbered subsequent workflow steps

**Tests Added/Modified:**
- N/A (documentation-only change)

**Documentation Updated:**
- `docs/internal/sprint-debug/fixes.md` - Embedded mandatory pre-flight checklists in template
- `docs/internal/sprint-debug/README.md` - Added pre-flight step to workflow, updated verification

**Verification:**
- [x] All tests pass (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Linting passes (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Type checking passes (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Black formatting check passes (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Documentation builds without warnings (markdown syntax valid)
- [x] No zero-mock violations detected (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Manual testing completed with realistic data (template structure validated)
- [x] Appropriate pre-flight checklist completed above

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/internal/sprint-debug/fixes.md` - Added pre-flight checklists to batch template
- `docs/internal/sprint-debug/README.md` - Added mandatory pre-flight workflow step

**Statistics:**
- Issues found: 3
- Issues fixed: 3
- Tests added: 0
- Code coverage change: 0%
- Lines changed: +160/-10 (approx)

**Commit Hash:** `79df8bd`
**Branch:** `main`
**PR Number:** N/A (direct commit)

**Notes:**
- These checklists are now MANDATORY for all future fix batches
- Documentation checklist adapted from proven Story 11.4 approach
- Framework checklist based on project coding standards and zero-mock enforcement
- Pre-flight completion is a verification gate - cannot commit without it
