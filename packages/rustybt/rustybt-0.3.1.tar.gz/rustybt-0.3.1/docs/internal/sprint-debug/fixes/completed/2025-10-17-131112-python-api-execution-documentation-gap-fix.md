**Issues Found:**

1. **Critical: Home page CLI-only execution** - `docs/index.md:79`
   - Only shows `rustybt run` command, no Python API alternative
   - New users never discover `run_algorithm()` exists
   - First impression sets CLI-first expectation

2. **Critical: Quick Start CLI-only tutorial** - `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md:82`
   - Complete tutorial shows only CLI execution
   - No Python API example despite being primary onboarding document
   - Missing benefits comparison between methods

3. **High: Pipeline strategy without execution** - `docs/guides/pipeline-api-guide.md:432`
   - Shows `MomentumStrategy` class definition
   - No instructions on how to execute it
   - Users don't know how to run Pipeline-based strategies

4. **High: Order types promise unfulfilled** - `docs/api/order-management/order-types.md:108`
   - Line 108 references "Complete Examples" section
   - Section exists but lacks execution instructions
   - Users see strategy examples but can't run them

5. **Medium: Audit logging without execution** - `docs/guides/audit-logging.md:421`
   - Shows `CustomStrategy` with logging setup
   - No execution example to generate logs
   - Missing log analysis example

6. **Medium: Portfolio management snippets only** - `docs/api/portfolio-management/README.md:77-142`
   - Shows portfolio access patterns in isolation
   - No complete runnable example from start to finish
   - Advanced users can infer, beginners cannot

7. **Missing: Comprehensive execution guide** - No central documentation
   - No single place explaining all execution methods
   - No comparison of CLI vs Python API vs Jupyter
   - No guidance on when to use each method

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- **Why did this issue occur:** Documentation inherited from Zipline's CLI-centric approach, never updated to prioritize Pythonic execution patterns. Original documentation focused on CLI as the primary execution method, with Python API treated as advanced/optional feature rather than first-class citizen.

- **What pattern should prevent recurrence:**
  1. All strategy examples must include both CLI and Python API execution examples
  2. Main onboarding paths (index.md, quickstart.md) must show Python API as primary or equal method
  3. Create comprehensive execution methods guide as central reference
  4. Document audit should check for execution instructions in all strategy examples
  5. Add "execution completeness" checklist to documentation review process

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Added Python API to home page** - `docs/index.md:82-118`
   - Added "Alternative: Python API Execution" section
   - Complete example with imports, execution, results
