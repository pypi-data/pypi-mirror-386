nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      No security-sensitive changes. Validation work is read-only. CLI commands properly use
      environment variables for credentials. No sensitive data exposed. Existing security measures
      (encryption, credential storage) unchanged.

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Performance baseline established: Decimal arithmetic 4.17ms, Memory 345MB RSS, File I/O 0.56ms.
      Regression testing configured (20% threshold). CI validated. Limited benchmark scope but
      sufficient for current validation.

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Broker integration validated (3 brokers: Binance, Bybit, Hyperliquid). Data sources validated
      (yfinance + ccxt). 30-day uptime validation deferred by design per AC (allowed to extend beyond
      story timeline). Operational commands verified functional.

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Code follows standards (Python 3.12+, async/await patterns). Documentation comprehensive
      (6 validation reports created). Validation procedures well-documented. Blockers documented
      with completion instructions. Minor: Could benefit from more type hints and automated CLI tests.

  - at: '2025-10-14T10:00:00Z'
    gate: CONCERNS
    note: 'Initial review - ccxt fix unvalidated, only 1 data source working, broker validation blocked'

  - at: '2025-10-14T18:00:00Z'
    gate: PASS
    note: 'All critical issues resolved - ccxt re-validated, 3 brokers validated, 2 data sources operational. 30-day paper trading deferred by design per AC.'

notes: |
  This story demonstrates excellent validation methodology and comprehensive resolution of blocking issues.
  The completion rate improved from 50% to 62.5% after addressing all critical concerns.

  GATE UPGRADED: CONCERNS → PASS

  Reasons for upgrade:
  1. ✅ ccxt data source fixed and re-validated (R1 resolved, score 9 → 0)
  2. ✅ 3 brokers validated successfully (R2 resolved, score 6 → 0)
  3. ✅ AC 1 complete (3 brokers exceeds requirement of 2)
  4. ✅ AC 2 complete (2 data sources: yfinance + ccxt)
  5. ✅ All NFR validations now PASS (reliability upgraded after broker/data validation)

  Remaining deferred items (30-day paper trading) are explicitly allowed per AC and should be
  completed via follow-up story X2.7.1 before final production deployment.

  Production readiness assessment:
  - Traditional assets: ✅ READY (yfinance validated)
  - Cryptocurrency trading: ✅ READY (ccxt + 3 brokers validated)
  - Live broker integration: ✅ READY (Binance, Bybit, Hyperliquid validated)
  - Long-term stability: ⚠️ PENDING (schedule 30-day paper trading validation)
