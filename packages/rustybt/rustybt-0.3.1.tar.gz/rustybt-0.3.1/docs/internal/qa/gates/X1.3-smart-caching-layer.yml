    ac_gaps: []  # All 30 ACs covered
  enhancements_implemented:
    - "Integration tests with PolarsDataPortal (6 end-to-end tests)"
    - "Cache warming feature (warm_cache() method)"
    - "Cache size alert system (>90% warning)"

# Non-functional requirements validation - UNCHANGED (still PASS)
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Proper path handling, SQLite parameterized queries, SHA256 cache keys, thread-safe operations. No new attack vectors introduced by enhancements."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Performance targets clearly defined and validated: <10ms cache lookup, <100ms cache hit read, >80% hit rate. Benchmark tests included. Cache warming feature improves cold-start performance."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, graceful degradation, thread-safe eviction, atomic transactions, extensive edge case handling (weekends, holidays, missing data). Alert system enhances production monitoring."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean abstractions (Strategy Pattern, Factory Pattern), excellent documentation (ADRs, docstrings), configurable behavior, testable design, low complexity. Enhancements maintain architectural consistency."

# Recommendations - UPDATED (all previous recommendations resolved)
recommendations:

  resolved:
    - action: "Add integration tests with PolarsDataPortal and TradingAlgorithm"
      refs: ["tests/integration/data/test_cache_end_to_end.py"]
      status: "✅ IMPLEMENTED - 6 comprehensive integration tests added"
      implementation_notes: "Tests cover cache hit/miss workflow, hit rate validation, concurrent access, persistence, drop-in replacement, and multi-frequency support. Tests simulate realistic backtest scenarios with 5s API delay mocks."

    - action: "Implement cache warming feature from ADR 003"
      refs: ["rustybt/data/sources/cached_source.py:235-281", "tests/data/sources/test_cached_source.py:262-279"]
      status: "✅ IMPLEMENTED - async warm_cache() method with tests"
      implementation_notes: "Async pre-fetch method for populating cache before backtests. Includes excellent documentation with real-world examples using exchange calendars. Structured logging for warming events."

    - action: "Add cache size alert system (>90% warning)"
      refs: ["rustybt/data/sources/cached_source.py:446-454", "tests/data/sources/test_cached_source.py:283-306"]
      status: "✅ IMPLEMENTED - automatic warning with actionable guidance"
      implementation_notes: "Automatic logger.warning() when cache exceeds 90% of limit. Provides actionable message suggesting cache clean or size increase. Unit test validates alert logic."
