# Quality Gate Decision: Story X1.1 - Adapter-Bundle Bridge
schema: 1
story: "8.1"
story_title: "Adapter-Bundle Bridge (Epic 7 Unblocking)"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met with 100% test pass rate. All QA fixes successfully applied and verified. Implementation is production-ready and fully unblocks Epic 7 profiling work."

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No credentials exposed, proper input validation, secure temp file handling, no injection vectors. Error logging doesn't expose sensitive data."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Meets profiling requirements: Daily 17-23s, Hourly 13-20s, Minute 25-40s. Metadata overhead <50ms. Test execution time 0.40s."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "100% test pass rate. Graceful error handling with explicit logging. Robust database initialization fixture. Metadata tracking fails gracefully."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear deprecation path, excellent documentation (436 lines), type hints added, self-documenting code, migration guide planned."
