  algorithms_implemented: 5
  algorithms_list:
    - "FixedAllocation - Static percentage allocation"
    - "DynamicAllocation - Performance-based momentum allocation (60-day lookback)"
    - "RiskParityAllocation - Inverse volatility weighting (252-day lookback)"
    - "KellyCriterionAllocation - Growth-optimal Kelly criterion (f* = μ/σ²)"
    - "DrawdownBasedAllocation - Risk-averse drawdown-aware allocation"

# Refactoring performed
refactoring:
  - file: "tests/portfolio/test_allocation.py"
    change: "Fixed test_kelly_criterion_allocation_formula"
    reason: "Original test used zero-variance returns causing equal allocation after normalization"
    solution: "Changed to small-variance returns (mean=0.001, std=0.0001) for proper Kelly formula testing"
    impact: "Test now properly validates Kelly criterion (μ/σ²) with high-return/low-variance vs low-return/high-variance strategies"

# Decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  PASS gate issued based on:

  1. **Complete Implementation**: All 5 allocation algorithms implemented with correct mathematical formulas
  2. **Comprehensive Testing**: 34 tests covering unit, property-based, integration, and edge cases (100% passing)
  3. **Production Quality**: Excellent code quality with full type hints, structured logging, proper error handling
  4. **Standards Compliance**: Full adherence to coding standards, project structure, and testing strategy
  5. **NFR Satisfaction**: Security, performance, reliability, and maintainability all validated
  6. **Zero Technical Debt**: No known issues, one test improvement applied during review

  The implementation is production-ready and demonstrates best practices in financial algorithm design.
