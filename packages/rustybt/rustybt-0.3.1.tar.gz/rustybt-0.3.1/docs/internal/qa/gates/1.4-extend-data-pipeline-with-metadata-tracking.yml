# Review summary
review_summary: |
  Story 1.4 demonstrates excellent software engineering with high-quality implementation:

  Strengths:
  - Outstanding zero-mock enforcement (all tests use real implementations)
  - Comprehensive unit test coverage (60 tests, all passing)
  - Clean, maintainable code with proper separation of concerns
  - Robust data validation (SHA256 checksums, OHLCV validation, gap detection)
  - Well-designed database schema with proper indexing
  - Type hints throughout for IDE support

  What's Complete:
  - AC1-7: Fully implemented and tested
  - All NFRs: Security, Performance, Reliability, Maintainability all PASS
  - Code quality: A- rating (91%)
  - Zero-mock compliance: Excellent

  What's Missing (AC8 incomplete):
  - Integration test for end-to-end bundle ingestion pipeline
  - Property-based tests using Hypothesis (both explicitly required)

  The implementation is production-ready from a functional standpoint. The only blocker
  for "Done" status is completing AC8 by adding the 2 missing test categories.

  Estimated effort: 2-4 hours

  Quality gate: CONCERNS (not FAIL) because the missing items are test completeness
  rather than functional defects. Code is ready for production use.

    change: "Fixed TypeError when using default database path"
    reason: "zipline_root() returns string but was used with / operator expecting Path object"
    test_impact: "test_catalog_initialization_default_path now passes"
