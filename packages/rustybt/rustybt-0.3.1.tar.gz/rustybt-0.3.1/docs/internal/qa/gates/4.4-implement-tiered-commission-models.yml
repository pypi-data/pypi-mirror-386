nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No vulnerabilities. Proper input validation, safe logging, appropriate error handling."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient algorithms: O(1) for most models, O(n) for tiered lookup where n is typically 3-5. Decimal precision appropriate for financial calculations."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions. Structured logging for observability. Edge cases handled correctly."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization with proper ABC usage. Comprehensive docstrings. Self-documenting code. Configuration externalized."

# Detailed findings
detailed_assessment:
  strengths:
    - "Perfect Decimal precision usage throughout - no float contamination"
    - "Comprehensive test suite: 24 tests (15 unit, 3 property-based, 3 integration, 3 edge cases)"
    - "Sophisticated features: negative rebates for makers, volume tracking with monthly reset"
    - "Zero-mock enforcement: All tests use real calculations, no hardcoded values"
    - "Excellent documentation: README with real-world broker examples (IB, Binance, Coinbase)"
    - "Clean architecture: Proper ABC pattern, clear separation of concerns"
    - "Structured logging with contextual information"
    - "Real-world broker profiles in YAML configuration"
    - "Integration with execution engine pipeline (Stories 4.1-4.3)"

  code_quality_highlights:
    - "100% type hint coverage on public APIs"
    - "Google-style docstrings with formulas and examples"
    - "Custom exceptions: CommissionConfigurationError, CommissionCalculationError"
    - "Frozen dataclasses for immutability (CommissionResult)"
    - "Proper handling of edge cases (zero quantity, negative rebates, month boundaries)"

  test_quality_highlights:
    - "Property-based tests validate mathematical invariants (Hypothesis)"
    - "Integration tests verify full execution pipeline with commission calculation"
    - "Real-world broker profiles tested (Interactive Brokers, Binance)"
    - "Edge cases: zero quantity, very large trades, frozen dataclass immutability"
    - "Test data uses realistic values (no magic numbers)"

  architecture_compliance:
    - "Files in correct locations per source tree"
    - "Proper separation: implementation (rustybt/finance/), tests (tests/finance/), config (config/)"
    - "Extends existing ExecutionEngine from Stories 4.1-4.3"
    - "Uses Decimal ledger integration for cash deductions"
    - "Follows established patterns from slippage and latency models"

# No recommendations needed - implementation is exemplary
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # Nothing must be fixed
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding binary search for tier lookup if profiles with >10 tiers emerge"
      priority: "low"
      refs: ["rustybt/finance/commission.py:716-721"]
      rationale: "Current O(n) lookup is fine for typical 3-5 tiers, but binary search would scale better"
    - action: "Consider LRU cache for repeated tier lookups in high-frequency scenarios"
      priority: "low"
      refs: ["rustybt/finance/commission.py:700-763"]
      rationale: "Premature optimization - only implement if profiling shows bottleneck"

# Commendations for exceptional work
commendations:
  - "This implementation sets the gold standard for transaction cost modeling"
  - "Exceptional attention to detail in handling negative rebates for maker orders"
  - "Volume tracking with monthly reset demonstrates deep understanding of real-world broker fee structures"
  - "Property-based tests show sophisticated quality engineering mindset"
  - "Documentation quality rivals professional open-source projects"
  - "Zero-mock compliance demonstrates commitment to testing real functionality"
