# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "3.4"
story_title: "Implement Base Data Adapter Framework"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Excellent implementation with comprehensive testing, clean architecture, and production-ready features. Environment setup issue (pytest-asyncio) was resolved during review."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
updated: "2025-10-01T00:00:00Z"

# No critical issues - environment setup issue was resolved
waiver: { active: false }

# Single minor issue identified and resolved during review
top_issues:
  - id: "ENV-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "pytest-asyncio dependency was in pyproject.toml but not installed, causing 9 async tests to fail"
    suggested_action: "Ensure 'pip install -e .[test]' is run in setup documentation"
    status: resolved
    resolution: "Installed pytest-asyncio 1.2.0, all 38 tests now pass"

# Extended quality information
quality_score: 95
quality_score_rationale: "Near-perfect implementation. -5 points for environment setup gap (not a code defect)."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No hardcoded credentials, proper input validation, secure logging, no injection vectors"

    status: PASS
    notes: "O(1) rate limiting, efficient MAD outlier detection, async/await throughout, Polars columnar operations"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exponential backoff with jitter, comprehensive validation, proper error propagation with context"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
