# Final notes

  ✅ GATE STATUS: PASS - Story ready for Done

  This is an excellent implementation with high code quality and comprehensive test coverage.
  All 10 acceptance criteria are met, and test coverage has been increased from 68% to 91%,
  exceeding the 90% target.

  TEST IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED:
  - Added 17 new tests (20 → 37 total tests)
  - notebook.py coverage: 40% → 92% (+52pp)
  - visualization.py coverage: 85% → 90% (+5pp)
  - Overall coverage: 68% → 91% (+23pp)

  KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
  - All async functions now tested (setup_notebook, async_backtest, with_progress decorator)
  - Edge cases covered (alternative column names, empty data, insufficient data)
  - Zero-mock enforcement maintained (all tests use real calculations)
  - All 37 tests passing

  REMAINING GAPS (Acceptable):
  - 6 lines in notebook.py (import error handling paths) - 92% is excellent
  - 13 lines in visualization.py (rare edge cases) - 90% meets standard

  RECOMMENDATION: Mark story as Done with confidence. All quality gates pass.
