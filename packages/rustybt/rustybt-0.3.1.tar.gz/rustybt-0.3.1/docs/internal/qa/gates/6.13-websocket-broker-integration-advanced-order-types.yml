# NFR validation results (updated)
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent key management (Hyperliquid: encrypted keystore, env vars, validation, address masking). All adapters handle credentials securely. No hardcoded secrets."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Rate limiting excellent across all adapters. WebSocket queue-based delivery is non-blocking. BarBuffer aggregation is O(1) per tick. No performance concerns."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "WebSocket auto-reconnect with exponential backoff verified. Lifecycle management properly tested. Error handling with exchange-specific exceptions validated."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code quality excellent: 100% type hints, Decimal precision, async/await, Google-style docstrings, structlog logging. Tests comprehensive and well-organized."
