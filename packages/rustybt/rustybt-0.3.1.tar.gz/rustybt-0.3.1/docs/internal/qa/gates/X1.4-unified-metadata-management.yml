    notes: "Excellent code quality, comprehensive documentation, clear deprecation path (v1.xâ†’v2.0), type hints throughout"

implementation_highlights:
  - "Unified BundleMetadata schema merges DataCatalog + ParquetMetadataCatalog functionality"
  - "Transactional migration with dry-run, backup/rollback, and SHA256 verification"
  - "Auto-population during ParquetWriter operations stores provenance, quality, and symbols"
  - "Deprecated catalogs emit warnings and forward to unified system (v2.0 removal planned)"
  - "CLI bundle commands (list/info/validate/migrate) with Rich formatting"
