# Quality Gate Decision - Story 6.6 (Final Review)
schema: 1
story: "6.6"
story_title: "Implement WebSocket Data Adapter Foundation"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Excellent production-ready implementation. Test coverage achieved 94.06% (exceeds 90% target by 4 points). All linting issues resolved. All 10 ACs fully implemented with 81 passing tests. Code quality, architecture, and comprehensive testing meet production standards."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No hardcoded secrets. Proper validation in constructors. Structured logging prevents log injection. Credential management deferred to broker integration."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Async/await eliminates blocking I/O. Circuit breaker prevents resource exhaustion. Exponential backoff prevents thundering herd. Efficient data structures (O(1) lookups)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exponential backoff reconnection (1sâ†’16s max). Circuit breaker trips after 10 consecutive errors. Heartbeat monitoring with 60s timeout. Auto re-subscription after reconnect."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent - All linting issues resolved. Zero ruff violations. Production-ready code quality with proper type hints, contextlib.suppress patterns, and specified exception handling."
  testability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "94.06% coverage exceeds 90% target. Comprehensive async lifecycle testing with 81 passing tests. Excellent edge case coverage."
