final_assessment: |
  Story 5.2 delivers an excellent implementation of the GridSearchAlgorithm that fully meets all
  acceptance criteria. The code is production-quality with comprehensive test coverage, excellent
  documentation, and proper adherence to all architectural guidelines.

  The implementation demonstrates:
  - Clean architecture with proper interface implementation
  - Comprehensive parameter validation using pydantic
  - Thread-safe parallel execution support
  - Excellent error handling and edge case coverage
  - Complete test coverage with unit, property, and integration tests
  - Zero-mock compliance throughout
  - Outstanding documentation with warnings and examples

  The only concerns are minor linting issues in the example file (60 violations) and test file
  (6 violations) that should be cleaned up before final release. These are easily fixable with
  automated tools and do not impact functionality.

  Recommended Status: Ready for Done (after addressing linting issues)
