# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Test infrastructure only, no security concerns. Validates financial calculation precision."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Test execution time appropriate: ~14s for 1,900 examples (quick profile), ~19s projected for 19,000 examples (default profile)"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 19 tests pass consistently. CI profile uses derandomize=true for reproducibility."
  maintainability:

    - action: "Consider expanding property tests to Decimal comparison operations (<, >, ==, !=)"
      refs: ["tests/finance/test_decimal_properties.py"]
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Enhancement opportunity, not blocking. Current coverage is comprehensive."

      refs: ["tests/finance/test_decimal_properties.py:16-82"]
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Would enable reuse across other test files. Already documented in property-based-testing.md."
