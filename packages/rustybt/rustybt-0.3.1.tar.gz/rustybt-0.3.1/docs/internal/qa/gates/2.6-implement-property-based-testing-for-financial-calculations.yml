nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. All test data synthetic, Hypothesis database git-ignored, no external API calls."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Property tests appropriately slower than unit tests. Quick profile (100 examples) provides rapid feedback, thorough profile (1000 examples) completes within reasonable time. Decimal overhead ~30% acceptable for correctness guarantees."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Hypothesis shrinking enabled for minimal failing examples. Weekly thorough runs detect edge cases. Four profiles (quick/thorough/ci/debug) provide flexibility. Tests can run in parallel with pytest-xdist."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization with custom strategies in strategies.py. Clear documentation in docs/testing/property-based-testing.md. Type hints throughout. Google-style docstrings. Black/Ruff formatting compliant."
