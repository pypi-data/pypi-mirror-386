decision_rationale: |
  Gate decision: CONCERNS (not PASS, not FAIL)

  This story represents exceptional engineering work:
  - Zero-mock enforcement throughout test suite
  - Property-based testing with Hypothesis (1000+ examples)
  - Statistical rigor with independent audit (95% CI, p<0.05)
  - Comprehensive documentation (1,750+ lines)
  - 74.97% performance improvement validated at production scale

  However, one acceptance criterion is not fully met:
  - AC1: Test coverage ≥90% overall → Currently 73%

  The coverage gap is concentrated in 5 specific modules (benchmarks and
  optimization infrastructure), while the core optimization modules exceed
  the 95% target. This indicates targeted work is needed, not a systemic
  testing deficiency.

  Given the high quality of existing tests and the clear path forward
  (2-3 days to add tests for 5 modules), this merits CONCERNS rather than
  FAIL. The team can address the coverage gap and re-run the gate without
  significant rework.

team_guidance: |
  This is outstanding work that demonstrates mastery of testing best practices.
  The coverage gap is easily addressable and should not overshadow the quality
  of the implementation, documentation, and validation rigor.

  Recommended approach:
  1. Add tests for the 5 low-coverage modules (estimated 2-3 days)
  2. Investigate intermittent test failures (estimated 0.5 days)
  3. Re-run coverage report to verify ≥90% overall
  4. Request re-review for gate promotion to PASS

  The quality bar has been set very high with this story. Maintain this
  standard for future work.
