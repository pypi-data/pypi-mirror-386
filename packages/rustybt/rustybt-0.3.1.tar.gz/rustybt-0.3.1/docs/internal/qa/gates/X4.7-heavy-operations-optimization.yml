  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Proper error handling, no credential leakage, platform detection prevents unsafe operations."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional - 173.73% cumulative speedup achieved (1.9x above 90% target). PersistentWorkerPool: 74.97%, SharedBundleContext Fork: 98.76%."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Functional equivalence validated for all accepted optimizations. 30/30 tests passing."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code quality exceptional. Zero diagnostics, complete type hints (CR-004), comprehensive docstrings."
