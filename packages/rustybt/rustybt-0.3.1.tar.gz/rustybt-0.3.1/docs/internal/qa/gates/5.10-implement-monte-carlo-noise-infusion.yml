# Detailed assessment
detailed_assessment:
  strengths:
    - "Clean separation: NoiseInfusionSimulator (orchestration) + NoiseInfusionResult (analysis)"
    - "Sophisticated OHLCV constraint validation with automatic fixing (np.maximum.reduce vectorization)"
    - "Dual noise models: Gaussian (baseline) and Bootstrap (preserves distribution)"
    - "Comprehensive statistical analysis: mean, std, CI, percentiles, degradation metrics"
    - "Publication-quality visualizations with interpretation guidance"
    - "Outstanding example notebook demonstrating robust vs fragile strategy detection"
    - "94% test coverage with unit, property-based, and integration tests"
    - "Zero-mock compliant: all calculations use real implementations"
    - "100% type hints coverage with proper Literal, Optional, Decimal usage"
    - "Immutable dataclass for results (frozen=True)"
    - "No mutation of input data (uses .clone())"

  test_coverage_analysis:
    coverage_percentage: 94
    uncovered_lines: "13 lines (mostly unreachable code branches in visualization logic)"
    test_types:
      - "Unit tests: Initialization, validation, noise addition, OHLCV fixing"
      - "Property-based tests: Noise amplitude scaling, OHLCV constraints preservation"
      - "Integration tests: Robust/fragile strategy detection, noise level comparison, CI validation"
    zero_mock_validation: "PASS - All tests use real numpy/polars calculations, no hardcoded values"
