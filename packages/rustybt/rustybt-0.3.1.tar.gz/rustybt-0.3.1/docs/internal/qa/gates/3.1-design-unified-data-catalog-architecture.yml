notes: |
  This is an exemplary architecture design document that demonstrates best practices in technical specification:

  1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 10 acceptance criteria thoroughly addressed with detailed evidence
  2. **Excellent Structure**: 59 well-organized sections covering overview, components, schemas, workflows, testing, security
  3. **Interface Design**: Complete Python interface contracts with type hints and docstrings
  4. **Schema Quality**: Well-designed SQLite schema with proper normalization, indexes, and foreign keys
  5. **Migration Planning**: Thoughtful HDF5â†’Parquet migration with validation, rollback, and parallel paths
  6. **Performance Focus**: Clear targets (cache hit <1ms hot, <100ms cold, 50-80% compression)
  7. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive coverage of unit, integration, property-based, and performance tests
  8. **Security Awareness**: Checksums (SHA256), access control, data privacy, encrypted credentials
  9. **Future Planning**: Phase 2 and Phase 3 enhancements identified
  10. **Documentation Quality**: 5,584 words, clear examples, configuration samples, data flow diagrams

  **Design Story Considerations**:
  Since this is a design/documentation story with no code implementation, the review focuses on:
  - Architecture quality and completeness
  - Interface contract clarity
  - Schema design soundness
  - Migration strategy feasibility
  - Testing strategy comprehensiveness
  - Documentation quality and accessibility

  **No Issues Found**: The documentation is thorough, well-structured, and provides clear guidance for implementation teams.

  **Recommendation**: APPROVED for implementation. This design serves as an excellent blueprint for Stories 3.2-3.8.
