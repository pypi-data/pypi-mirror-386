## Risk Assessment Matrix

### RESOLVED Risks (Initial Review)

| ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Status |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| R-001 | Benchmark execution placeholder implementation | HIGH | HIGH | 9 | ✅ RESOLVED |
| R-002 | NameError in test_memory_usage.py (undefined function) | MEDIUM | HIGH | 6 | ✅ RESOLVED |
| R-003 | NameError in detect_regressions.py (import ordering) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 4 | ✅ RESOLVED |
| R-004 | Documentation references unimplemented scripts | LOW | LOW | 2 | ✅ RESOLVED |
| R-005 | Fixtures not pre-generated | LOW | LOW | 1 | ⚠️ ACCEPTED |

**Risk Scoring**: Probability × Impact (1-3 scale, max=9)
- Critical: 9 (block release)
- High: 6-8 (concerns)
- Medium: 3-5 (monitor)
- Low: 1-2 (acceptable)

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### R-001: Benchmark Execution Placeholder ✅ RESOLVED
**Original Finding**: `run_backtest_benchmark()` returned mock results instead of executing actual backtests

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: HIGH - Would affect 100% of benchmark scenarios
- **Impact**: HIGH - Prevents performance validation, negates story value
- **Original Score**: 9 (CRITICAL)

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Actual `run_algorithm()` integration implemented (tests/benchmarks/test_backtest_performance.py:164-174)
- ✅ Bundle mapping for profiling bundles (daily, hourly, minute)
- ✅ Proper type conversions (Decimal → float for capital_base)
- ✅ Result extraction (portfolio_value, total_return, num_transactions)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with pytest.skip

**Verification**: Code review confirmed actual execution path with proper bundle loading and result capture.

**Residual Risk**: NONE

---

### R-002: test_memory_usage.py Function Name Bug ✅ RESOLVED
**Original Finding**: Line 219 called undefined function `create_complex_handle()`

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: MEDIUM - Would trigger on memory test execution
- **Impact**: HIGH - NameError would fail test suite
- **Original Score**: 6 (HIGH)

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Function call corrected to `create_handle_data_fn()` (line 219)
- ✅ Verified correct function exists in multi_indicator_strategy module

**Verification**: Code review confirmed correct function name usage.

**Residual Risk**: NONE

---

### R-003: detect_regressions.py Import Ordering Bug ✅ RESOLVED
**Original Finding**: `import os` statement appeared after usage

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: MEDIUM - Would trigger when accessing GITHUB_* env vars
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - NameError in CI/CD regression detection
- **Original Score**: 4 (MEDIUM)

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Import moved to top of `main()` function (line 245)
- ✅ Duplicate import at bottom removed

**Verification**: Code review confirmed import ordering corrected.

**Residual Risk**: NONE

---

### R-004: Documentation References Unimplemented Scripts ✅ RESOLVED
**Original Finding**: compare_benchmarks.py and query_history.py --summary mentioned but not implemented

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: LOW - Users reading docs might attempt to use
- **Impact**: LOW - Confusion, but not functional failure
- **Original Score**: 2 (LOW)

**Resolution**:
- ✅ `compare_benchmarks.py` fully implemented with CLI interface
- ✅ `query_history.py --summary` flag implemented in argparse
- ✅ Both scripts tested with `--help` output

**Verification**: Bash command execution confirmed scripts exist and work.

**Residual Risk**: NONE

---

### R-005: Fixtures Not Pre-Generated ⚠️ ACCEPTED
**Finding**: Benchmark data fixtures not generated yet

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: LOW - Generation script exists and is well-documented
- **Impact**: LOW - Tests will skip gracefully with pytest.skip
- **Current Score**: 1 (LOW)

**Mitigation**:
- Generation script ready (`scripts/benchmarks/generate_fixtures.py`)
- Clear documentation on fixture generation process
- Graceful degradation with pytest.skip when fixtures missing
- Size constraints documented (<500MB total target)
- CI/CD can cache fixtures once generated

**Acceptance Rationale**:
- Infrastructure is complete and functional
- Fixtures are generated on-demand when benchmarks are needed
- Deferred generation is acceptable for infrastructure story
- No blocking impact on production readiness

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL (accepted for story completion)

## Risk Mitigation Summary

| Risk Category | Total Identified | Resolved | Accepted | Blocking |
|---------------|------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Critical (9)  | 1                | 1        | 0        | 0        |
| High (6-8)    | 1                | 1        | 0        | 0        |
| Medium (3-5)  | 1                | 1        | 0        | 0        |

| **TOTAL**     | **5**            | **4**    | **1**    | **0**    |

**Gate Impact**: ✅ PASS (0 blocking risks)

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (Before Production)
✅ All critical items resolved

### Monitor (Future Execution)
1. **Fixture Generation Performance**: Monitor timing when generating minute data (43,200 bars × 50 assets)
2. **Memory Usage**: Track memory consumption during large portfolio benchmarks (500 assets)
3. **Benchmark Duration**: Validate each scenario completes in <60s when fixtures available

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Add fixture size validation warnings
2. Implement benchmark duration assertions
3. Add dashboard (AC10 optional)

---

## Conclusion

**Risk Status**: ✅ ALL CRITICAL RISKS RESOLVED
**Quality Score**: 95/100
**Gate Decision**: **PASS**

All identified risks from initial review have been successfully addressed. The benchmarking suite is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, actual backtest execution, and excellent documentation. Minor deduction for fixtures not pre-generated is acceptable as generation infrastructure is complete and robust.

**Recommendation**: Story ready for Done status. Infrastructure is complete, all acceptance criteria satisfied, and all blocking risks mitigated.
