## Story-Specific Considerations

**Story 11.4 has unique complexity requiring extra care:**

### Complex Topics Requiring Expert Verification

1. **Bayesian Optimization**
   - Prior distributions must be explained clearly
   - Acquisition functions must be documented correctly
   - Academic references may be needed for verification

2. **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**
   - Selection, crossover, mutation operators must be accurate
   - Evolutionary computation concepts require precision

3. **Financial Risk Metrics** (⚠️ CRITICAL - FINANCIAL ACCURACY)
   - VaR (Value at Risk): Standard formulas only, verify against financial standards
   - CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk): Tail risk calculations must be correct
   - Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar Ratios: Formulas and annualization must be accurate
   - All financial calculations will be verified in expert review

4. **Performance Attribution** (⚠️ COMPLEX)
   - Attribution methodologies have assumptions that must be stated
   - Multiple approaches exist, must document which is used
   - Expert review required for accuracy

5. **Live Trading Infrastructure** (⚠️ SAFETY CRITICAL)
   - Async programming patterns must be correct (no blocking calls in async functions)
   - State management persistence must be accurately described
   - Circuit breakers must be shown in ALL live trading examples
   - Safety patterns are non-negotiable
   - Production deployment guidance must emphasize testing

6. **Testing Utilities**
   - Property-based testing patterns must be accurate
   - Fixtures must show actual usage from framework test suite

### Documentation Strategy for Complex Topics

**For Each Complex Topic**:
1. **Understand before documenting**: Read source code thoroughly, test examples
2. **Verify formulas/algorithms**: Cross-check against academic sources or standards
3. **Test with realistic data**: Use actual data, not toy examples
4. **Show complete workflows**: Don't document fragments
5. **Expert review is mandatory**: These topics require validation

### Phased Approach for This Story

Given complexity, documentation will be created in phases with checkpoints:

1. **Phase 1**: Optimization Framework (6-10 hours)
2. **Phase 2**: Monte Carlo & Robustness (4-7 hours)
3. **Phase 3**: Analytics Suite (4-7 hours)
4. **Phase 4**: Live Trading Infrastructure (5-8 hours)
5. **Phase 5**: Testing Utilities (2-4 hours)
6. **Phase 6**: Validation & Expert Review (4-7 hours, multiple sessions)

User checkpoint after each phase before proceeding.
