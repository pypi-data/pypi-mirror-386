## User-Reported Issue

**User Error:**
```
User code from documentation does not work - attempting to await a non-async method
```

**User Scenario:**
User copied code example from documentation (`docs/guides/data-ingestion.md`) to ingest stock data using YFinance adapter. The example shows:

```python
from rustybt.data.sources import DataSourceRegistry
import pandas as pd
import asyncio

async def main():
    source = DataSourceRegistry.get_source("yfinance")
    await source.ingest_to_bundle(  # ‚ùå INCORRECT - method is not async!
        bundle_name="tech-stocks",
        symbols=["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN"],
        start=pd.Timestamp("2020-01-01"),
        end=pd.Timestamp("2023-12-31"),
        frequency="1d"
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Code should execute successfully and ingest data to bundle
- Example should be copy-paste executable

**Actual Behavior:**
- Code likely errors because `ingest_to_bundle` is a synchronous method, not async
- User gets confused because documentation is incorrect

**Impact:**
- üî¥ CRITICAL - All new users attempting to use the unified data ingestion API will hit this issue
- Blocks adoption of the unified data ingestion system
- Creates distrust in documentation quality

---

## Issues Found

**Issue 1: ingest_to_bundle is synchronous, not async** - `rustybt/data/sources/base.py:162`

In the source code, `ingest_to_bundle` is defined as a regular synchronous method:

```python
@abstractmethod
def ingest_to_bundle(  # ‚Üê NO async keyword!
    self,
    bundle_name: str,
    symbols: list[str],
    start: pd.Timestamp,
    end: pd.Timestamp,
    frequency: str,
    **kwargs: Any,
) -> None:
```

However, the documentation shows it being called with `await`.

**Issue 2: Documentation shows incorrect usage** - `docs/guides/data-ingestion.md:23`

Multiple locations in documentation show:
```python
await source.ingest_to_bundle(...)  # ‚ùå WRONG
```

When it should be:
```python
source.ingest_to_bundle(...)  # ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

**Issue 3: Example file has same error** - `docs/examples/ingest_yfinance.py:43`

The example file also uses `await` incorrectly.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why did this issue occur:**
1. `ingest_to_bundle` method is synchronous in the abstract base class
2. Documentation was written assuming the method would be async (likely because `fetch()` IS async)
3. No automated testing of documentation code examples
4. Examples not copy-pasted and tested before committing documentation

**What pattern should prevent recurrence:**
1. ALL documentation code examples must be tested in CI/CD
2. Create automated script that extracts code blocks from .md files and executes them
3. Add pre-commit hook that validates code examples against actual source code
4. Never assume API signatures - always verify against source code
5. Follow CR-006 (Documentation Quality Standards) requirement for executable examples

---

## Fixes Applied

**1. Fixed `docs/guides/data-ingestion.md`** - Main user documentation (11 occurrences)
- Removed `await` from all `ingest_to_bundle()` calls
- Simplified examples to remove unnecessary `async def main()` wrappers since `ingest_to_bundle` is synchronous
- Changed `await asyncio.sleep(1)` to `time.sleep(1)` in rate limiting example
- All examples now copy-paste executable without async overhead

**2. Fixed `docs/examples/ingest_yfinance.py`** - Example script (1 occurrence)
- Changed `async def main()` to `def main()` (no async needed)
- Removed `import asyncio`
- Removed `await` from `source.ingest_to_bundle()`
- Changed `asyncio.run(main())` to `main()`

**3. Fixed `docs/examples/ingest_ccxt.py`** - Example script (1 occurrence)
- Changed `async def main()` to `def main()` (no async needed)
- Removed `import asyncio`
- Removed `await` from `source.ingest_to_bundle()`
- Changed `asyncio.run(main())` to `main()`

**4. Fixed `docs/examples/custom_data_adapter.py`** - Custom adapter example (1 occurrence)
- Kept `async def main()` (required for `await source.fetch()`)
- Removed `await` from `source.ingest_to_bundle()` only
- Note: This example correctly uses async for `fetch()` which IS async

**5. Fixed `docs/api/datasource-api.md`** - API documentation (1 occurrence)
- Kept `async def main()` (required for `await source.fetch()`)
- Removed `await` from `source.ingest_to_bundle()` only

**6. Fixed `docs/api/data-management/pipeline/README.md`** - Pipeline docs (6 occurrences)
- Simplified 3 basic ingestion examples to remove async wrappers
- Fixed 3 code snippets showing incorrect await usage
- All examples now properly demonstrate synchronous `ingest_to_bundle`

**7. Fixed `docs/guides/migrating-to-unified-data.md`** - Migration guide (2 occurrences)
- Removed `await` from both migration examples
- Examples now show correct synchronous usage

## Notes

- ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Critical blocker for new users - all 23 user-facing occurrences fixed
- All code examples now copy-paste executable
- Confirmed with source code: All 6 adapters use `def ingest_to_bundle` (synchronous by design)
- Future improvement: Add CI validation to test documentation code examples automatically
- Decision: `ingest_to_bundle` is intentionally synchronous (calls async `fetch()` internally but blocks until complete)
