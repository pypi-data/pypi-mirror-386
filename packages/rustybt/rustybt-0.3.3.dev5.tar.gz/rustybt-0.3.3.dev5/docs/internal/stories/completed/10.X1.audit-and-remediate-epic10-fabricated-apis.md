# Story 10.X1: Audit and Remediate Epic 10 Fabricated API Documentation

## Status
Complete

## Story

**As a** framework user relying on documentation,
**I want** ALL documented APIs to exist in the actual codebase with verified implementation,
**So that** I can trust the documentation and use code examples without encountering ImportError or non-existent functionality.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Epic 10 documentation (Stories 10.1, 10.2, 10.3)
- Technology: Markdown documentation, Python source code verification
- Follows pattern: Data Management corrections (docs/api/data-management/CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md)
- Touch points: All Epic 10 API documentation files, source code in rustybt/ package

**Trigger**: Zero-mock enforcement violation discovered in Story 10.2 (TWAPOrder, VWAPOrder, IcebergOrder documented but not implemented)

**Scope**: Comprehensive audit of ALL API references across Epic 10 documentation to identify and remove fabricated content.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

**1. Complete Documentation Audit**
- Audit ALL documentation files created or modified in Stories 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3
- Identify EVERY API reference (classes, functions, methods, modules)
- Verify each reference exists in actual source code (rustybt/ package)
- Document all fabricated references with file locations and line numbers

**2. Strict Removal of Fabricated Content**
- Remove ALL documentation for APIs that do not exist in source code
- Remove code examples that reference non-existent APIs
- Remove import statements for non-existent classes/functions
- Do NOT add "Not Yet Implemented" placeholders - strict removal only

**3. Source Code Verification**
- For each documented API, provide source file path and line number where it exists
- Verify import paths are correct (e.g., `from rustybt.finance.execution import LimitOrder`)
- Confirm class names, function names, and method signatures match actual implementation

### Integration Requirements

**4. Maintain Documentation Structure**
- Preserve overall documentation organization and navigation
- Keep README files and section headers intact
- Maintain cross-references between valid documentation sections

**5. Update Validation Documents**
- Update all CODE_VALIDATION.md and CODE_EXAMPLES_VALIDATION.md files
- Remove false validation claims for fabricated APIs
- Add verification methodology section documenting audit process

**6. Corrections Summary**
- Create CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md for each affected documentation area
- Document what was removed, why it was fabricated, and source code verification
- Include statistics: total APIs audited, fabricated APIs removed, verification method

### Quality Requirements

**7. Zero Fabrication Tolerance**
- Final documentation must have 100% source code verification rate
- Every documented API must exist in rustybt/ package
- Every code example must use only verified APIs

**8. Automated Verification Script**
- Create Python script to validate all documented imports
- Script should extract imports from markdown code blocks
- Script should verify each import against actual source code
- Script should be runnable in CI/CD pipeline

**9. No Regression in Accurate Documentation**
- Do not remove or modify documentation for APIs that DO exist
- Preserve all accurate examples and explanations
- Maintain quality of existing correct documentation

## Technical Notes

### Integration Approach

This story remediates Epic 10 documentation created in Stories 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 by:
1. **Auditing**: Systematically reviewing every API reference
2. **Verifying**: Checking source code for actual implementation
3. **Removing**: Deleting all fabricated content strictly (no placeholders)
4. **Documenting**: Creating correction summaries for transparency

### Existing Pattern Reference

Follow the correction pattern established in Story 10.1:
- See: `docs/api/data-management/CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md`
- Pattern: Document what was wrong, why it was wrong, what was corrected
- Include before/after statistics and verification methodology

### Key Constraints

**Strict Removal Policy**:
- If API doesn't exist in source code → REMOVE documentation completely
- Do NOT add "Not Yet Implemented" sections
- Do NOT add "Planned for Future" sections
- Do NOT keep examples with comments like "# Will work when implemented"
- Complete removal is the only acceptable outcome

**Zero-Mock Enforcement Alignment**:
- Commandment #5: "NEVER claim completion for incomplete work"
- Documentation falsely claiming implementation existence violates this principle
- Strict removal ensures documentation integrity

### Source Code Verification Standards

For an API to remain documented, it must:
1. Exist in rustybt/ source code (not in tests, not in examples)
2. Be importable via documented import path
3. Have matching class/function name and signature
4. Be production code (not mock, stub, or placeholder)

### Known Fabrications (Initial List)

**Order Management** (Story 10.2):
- ❌ TWAPOrder (docs/api/order-management/order-types.md:340)
- ❌ VWAPOrder (docs/api/order-management/order-types.md:368)
- ❌ IcebergOrder (docs/api/order-management/order-types.md:395)

**Others**: To be discovered during audit

## Risk and Compatibility Check

### Primary Risk
**Risk**: Removing too much documentation, including valid APIs
**Mitigation**:
- Automated verification script double-checks before removal
- Manual spot-checks on random samples
- Preserve source file path references for all kept documentation

### Rollback
If incorrect removals are made:
- Git history preserves original documentation
- CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md documents what was removed
- Can restore specific sections if proven to exist in source

### Compatibility Verification

- [x] No breaking changes to source code (documentation only)
- [x] No changes to existing APIs (verification only)
- [x] Documentation structure preserved (only content removed)
- [x] Performance impact: None (documentation files only)

## Estimated Effort

**Total Estimated Time**: 10-16 hours

**Breakdown**:
- Phase 1 (Audit): 4-6 hours
- Phase 2 (Removal): 3-5 hours
- Phase 3 (Validation): 2-3 hours
- Phase 4 (Final Verification): 1-2 hours

**Complexity**: Medium
- Large volume of documentation to audit
- Requires systematic source code verification
- Low technical risk (documentation changes only)

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative**:
- 100% of documented APIs verified against source code
- 0 fabricated API references remaining
- Automated verification script passes with 100% rate

**Qualitative**:
- Documentation users trust examples will work
- Zero ImportError from following documented examples
- Clear audit trail via CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY files

## Dependencies

**Required Access**:
- All Epic 10 documentation files (read/write)
- rustybt/ source code (read-only for verification)
- Python environment for running verification script

**Blockers**:
- None (can proceed immediately)

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-10-14 | 1.0 | Initial story creation for Epic 10 documentation remediation | John (PM Agent) |

## Verification Methodology

### Automated Verification Script

**Script**: `scripts/verify_documented_apis.py`

**Process**:
1. Parse all markdown files in docs/api/
2. Extract Python code blocks
3. Identify import statements and class/function usage
4. For each import/usage:
   - Search rustybt/ source for implementation
   - Verify import path correctness
   - Confirm class/function name match
5. Generate report:
   - ✅ VERIFIED: API exists with correct path
   - ❌ FABRICATED: API not found in source
   - ⚠️ WARNING: API found but import path incorrect

**Output**: JSON report and human-readable summary

### Manual Verification

For each documented API:
1. Open source file at documented location
2. Verify class/function definition exists
3. Check signature matches documented usage
4. Confirm API is production code (not test/mock)
