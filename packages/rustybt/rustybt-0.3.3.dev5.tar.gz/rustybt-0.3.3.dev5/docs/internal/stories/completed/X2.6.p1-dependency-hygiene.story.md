# Story X2.6: P1 Dependency Hygiene

## Status
Completed

## Story

**As a** Software Engineer maintaining supply chain security,
**I want** clean production/dev dependency split, vulnerability remediation, and license compliance enforcement,
**so that** production deployments have minimal attack surface, 0 High/Critical vulnerabilities, and only approved licenses.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Dependency Split

1. **Production vs Dev Split**
   - Create `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` extra for development-only packages
   - Move to dev extra: `jupyter`, `jupyterlab`, `streamlit`, `torch` (if present)
   - Move to dev extra: Type stubs (`pandas-stubs`, `types-*`)
   - Verify core dependencies remain in `[project.dependencies]`
   - Document installation: `uv sync` (prod) vs. `uv sync -E dev -E test` (dev)

### Vulnerability Remediation

2. **Vulnerability Remediation**
   - Run `safety scan` to identify vulnerable packages
   - Prioritize High/Critical vulnerabilities for immediate upgrade
   - Upgrade packages to patched versions where available
   - Pin packages with known vulnerabilities if upgrade breaks compatibility
   - Document unresolved vulnerabilities with justification and mitigation plan
   - Verify production extras exclude dev-only vulnerable packages

3. **Lockfile Verification**
   - Run `uv lock` to update lock file with new versions
   - Verify `uv.lock` includes vulnerability metadata (if supported)
   - Run test suite with new lockfile: `uv sync -E test && pytest`
   - Verify no dependency resolution conflicts
   - Commit updated `uv.lock` with story changes

### License Compliance

4. **License Compliance Check**
   - Create `scripts/check_licenses.py` to scan dependency licenses
   - Ensure no GPL-licensed dependencies (Apache 2.0/MIT only)
   - Document any exceptions with justification
   - Integrate with CI (weekly dependency-security workflow from Story X2.5)

### Technical Implementation Guidance

**Dependency Split Strategy:**

**Current Structure (pyproject.toml):**
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    # Core dependencies (production-required)
    "pandas>=2.0.0",
    "numpy>=1.24.0",
    "polars>=0.20.0",
    "ccxt>=4.0.0",
    # ... many more including dev tools
]
```

**Target Structure:**
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    # Production-only dependencies
    "pandas>=2.0.0",
    "numpy>=1.24.0",
    "polars>=0.20.0",
    "ccxt>=4.0.0",
    "ib-insync>=0.9.86",
    "yfinance>=0.2.0",
    "structlog>=23.0.0",
    "pydantic>=2.0.0",
    # ... core only
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    # Development tools
    "jupyter>=1.0.0",
    "jupyterlab>=4.0.0",
    "ipython>=8.0.0",
    "streamlit>=1.30.0",
    # Type stubs
    "pandas-stubs>=2.0.0",
    "types-requests>=2.31.0",
    "types-PyYAML>=6.0.1",
    "types-networkx>=3.1.0",
    # Documentation
    "mkdocs>=1.5.0",
    "mkdocs-material>=9.0.0",
]

test = [
    # Testing tools (from X2.1)
    "pytest>=7.2.0",
    "pytest-cov>=3.0.0",
    "pytest-xdist>=2.5.0",
    "freezegun>=1.2.0",
    "responses>=0.23.0",
    "hypothesis>=6.0.0",
]
```

**Installation Commands:**
```bash
# Production only
uv sync

# Development
uv sync -E dev -E test

# Testing only
uv sync -E test
```

---

**Vulnerability Remediation Process:**

**Step 1: Identify Vulnerabilities**
```bash
# Run safety scan
uv run safety scan --json > safety-report.json

# Run pip-audit
uv run pip-audit --format json > pip-audit-report.json

# Review reports
cat safety-report.json | jq '.vulnerabilities[]'
cat pip-audit-report.json | jq '.vulnerabilities[]'
```

**Step 2: Prioritize Remediation**
```
Priority 1: High/Critical vulnerabilities in production dependencies
Priority 2: Medium vulnerabilities in production dependencies
Priority 3: High/Critical vulnerabilities in dev dependencies
Priority 4: Low/Medium vulnerabilities in dev dependencies
```

**Step 3: Upgrade or Pin**
```bash
# For upgradeable packages
uv add "package>=fixed_version"

# For packages without patches
# Option A: Pin to secure version if downgrade acceptable
uv add "package==last_secure_version"

# Option B: Document risk if upgrade breaks compatibility
# Add to docs/security-audit.md:
# - Package: package_name
# - Vulnerability: CVE-XXXX-XXXX
# - Severity: Medium
# - Status: Accepted (no patch available)
# - Mitigation: Not using vulnerable functionality
# - Review Date: 2025-Q2
```

**Step 4: Update Lockfile**
```bash
# Regenerate lockfile with new versions
uv lock

# Verify resolution succeeds
uv sync -E dev -E test

# Run test suite to verify compatibility
uv run pytest
```

**License Compliance Script:**

**Purpose:** Ensure no GPL-licensed dependencies (Apache 2.0/MIT only).

**Implementation:**
```python
# scripts/check_licenses.py
import json
import subprocess
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List

FORBIDDEN_LICENSES = ['GPL', 'AGPL', 'LGPL', 'SSPL']
ALLOWED_LICENSES = ['MIT', 'Apache', 'BSD', '3-Clause', '2-Clause', 'ISC', 'Python']

def get_installed_packages() -> List[str]:
    """Get list of installed packages."""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['uv', 'pip', 'list', '--format=json'],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    packages = json.loads(result.stdout)
    return [pkg['name'] for pkg in packages]

def get_package_license(package_name: str) -> str:
    """Get license for a package using pip-licenses."""

        if licenses:
            return licenses[0].get('License', 'UNKNOWN')
    except:
        pass
    return 'UNKNOWN'

def check_license(license_str: str) -> bool:
    """Check if license is allowed."""
    license_upper = license_str.upper()

    # Check for forbidden licenses
    for forbidden in FORBIDDEN_LICENSES:
        if forbidden in license_upper:
            return False

    # Check for allowed licenses
    for allowed in ALLOWED_LICENSES:
        if allowed.upper() in license_upper:
            return True

    # Unknown or uncommon license - warn
    return None

def main():
    """Check all package licenses."""
    print("Checking dependency licenses...")

    # Install pip-licenses if not available
    subprocess.run(['uv', 'pip', 'install', 'pip-licenses'], capture_output=True)

    packages = get_installed_packages()

    forbidden_packages = []
    unknown_packages = []

    for package in packages:
        license_str = get_package_license(package)
        result = check_license(license_str)

        if result is False:
            forbidden_packages.append((package, license_str))
        elif result is None:
            unknown_packages.append((package, license_str))

    # Report results
    if forbidden_packages:
        print("\n❌ FORBIDDEN LICENSES DETECTED:")
        for package, license_str in forbidden_packages:
            print(f"  - {package}: {license_str}")
        sys.exit(1)

    if unknown_packages:
        print("\n⚠️ UNKNOWN LICENSES (review required):")
        for package, license_str in unknown_packages:
            print(f"  - {package}: {license_str}")

    print("\n✅ All dependencies use allowed licenses")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check licenses (CI integration)
python scripts/check_licenses.py
```

| LIC-001 | Medium | frozendict (LGPL v3) in production via yfinance | Evaluate alternatives to yfinance or fork with MIT replacement | dev |
| LIC-002 | Low | chardet (LGPL) in dev via tox | Replace tox with modern alternative (nox, hatch) | dev |
| SEC-001 | Low | pip 25.2 CVE-2025-8869 (dev-time, tarfile extraction) | Monitor for pip 25.3 release, upgrade immediately | dev |

### Quality Score: 92/100

**Calculation**: 100 - (1 medium * 5) - (2 low * 1.5) = 92

### Strengths

- 48% reduction in production dependencies improves security posture
- Zero production vulnerabilities demonstrates excellent dependency hygiene
- Comprehensive security infrastructure with automated scanning
- Clear documentation of accepted risks with mitigation strategies
- Modern package management (uv) for improved performance
- Strong CI/CD integration with automated issue creation

### Recommendations

**Immediate:**
- Document LGPL dependencies in project README as known limitations

**Future (Next Sprint):**
- Evaluate alternatives to yfinance to remove LGPL dependency (Priority: Medium)
- Consider replacing tox with nox or hatch (Priority: Low)
- Upgrade pip to 25.3 when available (Priority: Medium)

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/X2.6-dependency-hygiene.yml

**Decision Rationale**: Excellent implementation with all acceptance criteria met. LGPL dependencies represent non-blocking deviation from strict Apache 2.0/MIT-only policy but are properly documented with justification and mitigation plans. LGPL allows dynamic linking without GPL contamination, maintaining legal compliance. Recommended for acceptance with tracking of license compliance improvements for future sprints.
