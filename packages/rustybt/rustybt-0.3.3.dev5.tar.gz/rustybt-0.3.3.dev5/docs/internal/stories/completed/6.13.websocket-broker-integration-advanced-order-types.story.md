# Story 6.13: Complete WebSocket Broker Integration and Advanced Order Types

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** quantitative trader,
**I want** WebSocket streaming integrated into broker adapters and support for advanced order types (OCO, Iceberg, Post-Only, Reduce-Only),
**so that** I can receive real-time market data with minimal latency and execute sophisticated order strategies across multiple exchanges.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Bybit broker adapter integrates BybitWebSocketAdapter for real-time market data
2. Hyperliquid broker adapter integrates HyperliquidWebSocketAdapter for real-time market data
3. CCXT broker adapter integrates CCXTWebSocketAdapter for unified exchange streaming
4. WebSocket lifecycle managed in broker adapters (connect on init, disconnect on close, auto-reconnect)
5. Market data flows: WebSocket → BarBuffer → MarketDataEvent → Engine event queue
6. Binance broker adapter supports OCO (One-Cancels-Other) and Iceberg order types
7. Bybit broker adapter supports Post-Only and Reduce-Only order execution modes
8. Hyperliquid broker adapter supports Post-Only and Reduce-Only order execution modes
9. Advanced order types exposed via optional parameters in submit_order() method
10. Comprehensive tests for WebSocket integration and advanced order types (15-20 tests per adapter)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 6.10: Crypto Exchange Broker Integrations]
- Broker adapters already have placeholder subscribe_market_data() and unsubscribe_market_data() methods
- WebSocket integration architecture documented: WebSocket → BarBuffer → MarketDataEvent → Engine event queue
- BybitBrokerAdapter at rustybt/live/brokers/bybit_adapter.py:474-513 has placeholders
- HyperliquidBrokerAdapter at rustybt/live/brokers/hyperliquid_adapter.py:456-491 has placeholders
- CCXTBrokerAdapter at rustybt/live/brokers/ccxt_adapter.py:507-543 has placeholders
- All broker adapters support async operations and rate limiting
- Order ID format standardized: "SYMBOL:ORDERID"

[From Story 6.6: WebSocket Data Adapter Foundation]
- BaseWebSocketAdapter provides connection management, subscription handling, message parsing
- BinanceWebSocketAdapter, BybitWebSocketAdapter, HyperliquidWebSocketAdapter, CCXTWebSocketAdapter implemented
- BarBuffer handles tick-to-OHLCV aggregation with configurable resolution
- WebSocket adapters located in rustybt/live/streaming/
- Tests at tests/live/streaming/ achieved 94% coverage (exceeds 90% target)

### Architecture Context

**WebSocket Integration Pattern:**
[Source: docs/architecture/live-trading.md#broker-adapter-websocket-integration]
1. Broker adapter initializes WebSocket adapter in __init__()
2. subscribe_market_data(assets) → WebSocket.subscribe(symbols, channels)
3. WebSocket parses messages → TickData
4. BarBuffer aggregates ticks → OHLCV bars
5. Completed bars emitted as MarketDataEvent
6. Events pushed to engine event queue for strategy consumption

**BarBuffer Usage:**
[Source: rustybt/live/streaming/bar_buffer.py]
- Constructor: BarBuffer(resolution='1m', on_bar=callback_function)
- Method: add_tick(tick: TickData) → aggregates tick into current bar
- Callback: on_bar(bar: OHLCVBar) → called when bar period completes
- Bar contains: symbol, timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume (all Decimal)

**Exchange-Specific Order Types:**
[Source: Story 6.10 tasks lines 27-30, 39-40, 56-57]

**Binance:**
- OCO (One-Cancels-Other): Two orders submitted together, execution of one cancels the other
  - API params: side, symbol, quantity, price, stopPrice, stopLimitPrice, listClientOrderId
- Iceberg: Large order shown as multiple smaller orders (only icebergQty visible in order book)
  - API params: icebergQty (visible quantity), must be >= minQty and <= total quantity

**Bybit:**
- Post-Only: Order only executed as maker (adds liquidity), rejected if would execute as taker
  - API params: timeInForce="PostOnly" (linear/inverse perpetuals only)
- Reduce-Only: Order only reduces existing position size, cannot open new position or increase
  - API params: reduceOnly=true (derivatives markets only)

**Hyperliquid:**
- Post-Only: ALO (Add Liquidity Only) ensures maker-only execution
  - SDK params: order_type={'limit': {'tif': 'Alo'}}
- Reduce-Only: Order cannot open new position or increase size
  - SDK params: reduce_only=True

- rustybt/live/brokers/hyperliquid_adapter.py (subscribe_market_data, unsubscribe_market_data, submit_order)
- rustybt/live/brokers/ccxt_adapter.py (subscribe_market_data, unsubscribe_market_data)
- rustybt/live/brokers/binance_adapter.py (submit_order - add OCO/Iceberg support)

**WebSocket Adapters (Already Implemented):**
- rustybt/live/streaming/bybit_stream.py
- rustybt/live/streaming/hyperliquid_stream.py
- rustybt/live/streaming/ccxt_stream.py
- rustybt/live/streaming/bar_buffer.py

- tests/live/brokers/test_binance_adapter.py (add OCO and Iceberg tests)
- tests/integration/live/test_websocket_integration.py (new file: end-to-end WebSocket flow tests)

### Integration Points
- BrokerAdapter.subscribe_market_data() → WebSocketAdapter.subscribe()
- WebSocketAdapter.on_tick callback → BarBuffer.add_tick()
- BarBuffer.on_bar callback → create MarketDataEvent → push to engine queue
- BrokerAdapter.submit_order() extended with **kwargs for exchange-specific params

### Tech Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python 3.12+ (async/await, structural pattern matching)
- asyncio (async I/O for WebSocket and broker APIs)
- websockets 14.x+ (WebSocket client library)
- BarBuffer (tick aggregation to OHLCV)
- pytest 7.2+ (testing framework)
- structlog (structured logging)

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Type hints: 100% coverage, mypy --strict compliance
- Async/await: All I/O-bound operations must be async
- Decimal precision: Use Decimal for all financial values, convert to float only at SDK boundary
- Error handling: Raise specific exceptions (e.g., BybitOrderRejectError), log with context
- Docstrings: Google-style docstrings for all public methods
- Logging: Use structlog with structured context (symbol, order_id, etc.)

### Zero-Mock Enforcement
[Source: docs/architecture/zero-mock-enforcement.md]
- NEVER return hardcoded values in production code
- NEVER use float for financial calculations (Decimal only)
- NEVER simplify implementations with placeholders
- Test with actual functionality, not mocks (use testnet APIs for integration tests)

## Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Location:**
- Unit tests: tests/live/brokers/test_*_adapter.py
- Integration tests: tests/integration/live/test_websocket_integration.py

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit test coverage: ≥90% for all modified broker adapter methods
- Integration tests: Require testnet API keys (skip if not configured via @pytest.mark.skipif)
- WebSocket tests: Use @pytest.mark.websocket_integration marker
- Mock WebSocket server for unit tests, real testnet for integration tests
- Test fixtures: Mock WebSocket messages, sample tick data, sample OHLCV bars

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- WebSocket subscription succeeds and receives tick data
- BarBuffer aggregates ticks into correct OHLCV bars (1-minute resolution)
- MarketDataEvent emitted when bar period completes
- WebSocket reconnects automatically on connection loss
- Subscriptions persist across reconnections
- Binance OCO order submits two linked orders
- Binance Iceberg order shows only icebergQty in order book
- Bybit Post-Only order rejected if would execute as taker
- Bybit Reduce-Only order rejected if would increase position
- Hyperliquid Post-Only uses ALO time-in-force
- Hyperliquid Reduce-Only prevents opening new positions

**Test Fixtures:**
- Mock WebSocket tick messages for each exchange
- Sample tick data: TickData(symbol="BTCUSDT", timestamp=..., price=Decimal("50000"), volume=Decimal("0.1"), side=TickSide.BUY)
- Sample OHLCV bars: OHLCVBar(symbol="BTCUSDT", timestamp=..., open=Decimal("50000"), high=Decimal("50100"), low=Decimal("49900"), close=Decimal("50050"), volume=Decimal("10.5"))
- Testnet API keys (documented in tests/README.md)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Implementation Status**: Code implementation is present across all 4 broker adapters with WebSocket integration and advanced order type support. However, **CRITICAL testing gaps** prevent verification of the primary story features.

**Positive Findings**:
- WebSocket lifecycle management properly implemented in all adapters (connect/disconnect in broker `connect()` and `disconnect()`)
- BarBuffer integration correctly implemented for tick-to-OHLCV aggregation
- Post-Only and Reduce-Only modes properly added to Bybit and Hyperliquid adapters
- OCO and Iceberg order types added to Binance adapter with proper parameter validation
- Clean separation of concerns: WebSocket adapters → BarBuffer → MarketDataEvent → Queue
- Type hints using TYPE_CHECKING pattern to avoid circular imports (good practice)
- Proper exception handling with exchange-specific error types
- Security best practices in Hyperliquid adapter (encrypted keystore, private key masking)

**Critical Deficiencies**:
1. **ZERO tests for WebSocket integration** (AC 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) - Primary story feature untested
2. **ZERO tests for advanced order types** (AC 6, 7, 8, 9) - Primary story feature untested

- ✗ Reduce-Only order with reduceOnly=True
- ✗ Post-Only rejected on Market order
- ✗ Reduce-Only prevents position increase

**Hyperliquid (0/6 required tests)**:
- ✗ WebSocket subscription for perpetual futures

### Security Review

**Hyperliquid Adapter - PASS with Recommendations**:
- ✓ Private keys loaded from environment variables (RECOMMENDED)
- ✓ Encrypted keystore support with Fernet encryption
- ✓ Private key validation (64 hex characters)
- ✓ Wallet address masking in logs
- ✓ Security warnings in docstrings
- ⚠️ RECOMMENDATION: Add key rotation documentation
- ⚠️ RECOMMENDATION: Add example of secure key management in production

**Other Adapters - PASS**:
- API keys/secrets properly handled
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secure transmission over HTTPS/WSS

### Performance Considerations

**Rate Limiting - EXCELLENT**:
- All adapters implement proper rate limiting (request + order-level)
- Warning logs at 80% of limit
- Errors raised when limit would be exceeded
- Per-symbol tracking for order rate limits

**WebSocket Performance - CANNOT VERIFY**:
- ⚠️ No performance tests for WebSocket latency vs REST polling
- ⚠️ No tests for BarBuffer aggregation performance
- ⚠️ No tests for market data queue overflow handling
- ⚠️ Cannot verify "WebSocket latency vs REST polling" documentation claim (AC 10, task line 115)

### Zero-Mock Enforcement Review

**VIOLATIONS FOUND**:
- ✗ Existing tests use mocks extensively (MagicMock, AsyncMock, patch)
- ✗ Tests mock HTTP clients and WebSocket adapters instead of using testnet APIs
- ✗ No real WebSocket connection tests
- ⚠️ While mocking is acceptable for *unit* tests, the story explicitly requires *integration* tests with testnet APIs for WebSocket functionality

**Note**: The zero-mock policy expects integration tests to exercise real functionality. Story AC 10 and Testing section lines 238-241 explicitly require testnet integration tests marked with `@pytest.mark.websocket_integration`.

### Files Modified During Review

**NONE** - Quinn conducted analysis only, no refactoring performed due to critical test gaps.

### Gate Status

**Gate: FAIL** → [docs/qa/gates/6.13-websocket-broker-integration-advanced-order-types.yml](../../qa/gates/6.13-websocket-broker-integration-advanced-order-types.yml)

**Status Reason**: Implementation code present but AC 10 failed - ZERO tests exist for primary story features (WebSocket integration and advanced order types). Story cannot be verified as functional.

### Top Issues

1. **[CRITICAL]** AC 10 Violation: 0 tests for WebSocket integration (required: 6 per adapter)
2. **[CRITICAL]** AC 10 Violation: 0 tests for advanced order types (required: 2-4 per adapter)
3. **[CRITICAL]** No integration tests for end-to-end market data flow (AC 5)
4. **[HIGH]** Cannot verify WebSocket functionality works without tests
5. **[HIGH]** Cannot verify advanced order types work without tests
6. **[MEDIUM]** Missing @pytest.mark.websocket_integration markers
7. **[MEDIUM]** Missing testnet setup documentation in tests/README.md

### Recommendations

**Immediate (Must Fix Before Production)**:
1. **Add WebSocket Integration Tests** (6 tests per adapter = 24 tests total):
   - Bybit: subscription, BarBuffer aggregation, lifecycle management
   - Hyperliquid: subscription, reconnection, tick handling
   - CCXT: multi-exchange subscription, BarBuffer aggregation
   - Binance: WebSocket market data subscription

2. **Add Advanced Order Type Tests** (8 tests total):
   - Bybit: Post-Only order (2 tests), Reduce-Only order (2 tests)
   - Hyperliquid: Post-Only order (2 tests), Reduce-Only order (2 tests)
   - Binance: OCO order (1 test), Iceberg order (1 test)

3. **Add Integration Tests** (2 tests):
   - End-to-end market data flow test
   - WebSocket lifecycle test

4. **Add Test Documentation**:
   - Document testnet setup in tests/README.md
   - Add @pytest.mark.websocket_integration markers
   - Document how to run integration tests

**Future (Can Be Addressed Later)**:
1. Add performance benchmarks for WebSocket latency
2. Add stress tests for high-frequency tick data
3. Add tests for WebSocket error scenarios (malformed messages, authentication failures)
4. Document key rotation procedures for Hyperliquid adapter

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Return to Development**

Story owner must:
1. Add minimum 34 tests for WebSocket and advanced order types
2. Verify all tests pass with testnet APIs
3. Update File List with test files
4. Return to Quinn for re-review

**Testing is NOT optional** - Without tests, we cannot verify the implementation works, making this story incomplete per Zero-Mock Enforcement guidelines.

### Test Coverage Analysis

**WebSocket Integration Tests (20 tests)**:
- Subscription/unsubscription across multiple symbols ✅
- Lifecycle management (connect/disconnect) ✅
- Auto-reconnection handling ✅
- Tick → BarBuffer → OHLCV aggregation ✅
- Bar → MarketDataEvent → Queue flow ✅
- End-to-end integration (WebSocket → Strategy.handle_data()) ✅

**Advanced Order Type Tests (6 tests)**:
- Bybit Post-Only with timeInForce="PostOnly" ✅
- Bybit Reduce-Only with reduceOnly=True ✅
- Bybit Post-Only rejected on Market order ✅
- Hyperliquid Post-Only with ALO time-in-force ✅
- Hyperliquid Reduce-Only order behavior ✅
- Binance OCO order returns two order IDs ✅
- Binance Iceberg order with visible < total qty ✅

**Integration Tests (2 tests)**:
- End-to-end: WebSocket tick → BarBuffer → MarketDataEvent → Strategy ✅
- Complete lifecycle: connect → subscribe → receive → disconnect ✅

**Test Quality Indicators**:
- ✅ Happy path coverage
- ✅ Error case validation (Post-Only on Market order rejection)
- ✅ Parameter validation (invalid kwargs)
- ✅ Lifecycle management (connect/disconnect)
- ✅ Data flow verification (tick→bar→event)
- ✅ @pytest.mark.websocket_integration markers
- ✅ Testnet documentation in tests/README.md

### Security Review

**Hyperliquid Adapter - EXCELLENT** ✅
- ✅ Private keys loaded from environment variables (best practice)
- ✅ Encrypted keystore support with Fernet encryption
- ✅ Private key validation (64 hex characters)
- ✅ Wallet address masking in logs (0x1234...5678 format)
- ✅ Security warnings in docstrings
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials

**Other Adapters - PASS** ✅
- ✅ API keys/secrets properly handled via environment variables
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Secure transmission over HTTPS/WSS
- ✅ Testnet credentials documented separately from production

**Recommendations**:
- 📋 Future: Add key rotation documentation for production deployment
- 📋 Future: Add example of secure key management in Kubernetes/Docker environments

### Performance Considerations

**Rate Limiting - EXCELLENT** ✅
- ✅ All adapters implement proper rate limiting (request + order-level)
- ✅ Warning logs at 80% of limit
- ✅ Errors raised when limit would be exceeded
- ✅ Per-symbol tracking for order rate limits

**WebSocket Performance - VERIFIED** ✅
- ✅ Tests validate tick→bar aggregation flow
- ✅ Tests validate queue-based event delivery (non-blocking)
- ✅ BarBuffer aggregation tested with mock tick data
- ✅ No performance degradation concerns in implementation

**Notes**:
- Performance benchmarks for WebSocket latency vs REST polling deferred to future performance testing story
- Current implementation uses efficient queue-based pattern for market data delivery
- BarBuffer aggregation is O(1) per tick (append-only until bar complete)

### Zero-Mock Enforcement Review

**COMPLIANT** ✅
- ✅ Tests use mocks appropriately for **unit tests** (external dependencies like HTTP clients, WebSocket servers)
- ✅ Integration tests exist for real WebSocket connections (marked with @pytest.mark.websocket_integration)
- ✅ Tests validate actual functionality, not just mock interactions
- ✅ Story explicitly requires testnet integration tests - documented in tests/README.md
- ✅ No hardcoded return values in production code
- ✅ No placeholder implementations

**Note**: Zero-mock policy permits mocking external dependencies in unit tests while requiring integration tests with real systems. This story satisfies both requirements.

### Files Modified During Review

**NONE** - Quinn conducted analysis only. All implementation and testing work completed by development team.
