# Epic 9: RESTful API & WebSocket Interface (Lowest Priority)

**Expanded Goal**: Build FastAPI REST API and WebSocket interface for remote strategy execution and real-time monitoring. **Priority: Lowest - Evaluate necessity after Epic 6 validates that scheduled/triggered operations provide sufficient live trading control. If Epic 6's scheduled calculations and live trading engine meet all operational needs, this epic may be deferred indefinitely or removed.** Testing and documentation integrated throughout.

4. Query parameters supported (date range filters, symbol filters, resolution)
5. Response format JSON with Decimal values serialized as strings (preserve precision)
6. Pagination supported for large result sets (positions, history)
7. Authentication required for all portfolio endpoints
8. Tests validate correct portfolio state returned for various scenarios
9. Performance tested: queries return in reasonable time
10. Example client demonstrates fetching portfolio and rendering chart

## Story 9.5: Implement Order Management Endpoints

**As a** quantitative trader,
**I want** REST API endpoints to submit, cancel, and query orders,
**so that** I can manage orders programmatically from external tools.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. POST /orders submits new order (symbol, quantity, order type, limit price, etc.)
2. GET /orders returns all orders with status (pending, filled, canceled, rejected)
3. GET /orders/{id} returns specific order details
4. DELETE /orders/{id} cancels pending order
5. PUT /orders/{id} modifies pending order (e.g., change limit price)
6. Order validation before submission (symbol exists, quantity valid, sufficient cash)
7. Authentication required for all order endpoints
8. Tests validate order lifecycle (submit → fill/cancel → query status)
9. Integration test with paper broker validates orders submitted via API execute correctly
10. Documentation explains order submission parameters and order types

## Story 9.6: Implement Performance Metrics Endpoints

**As a** quantitative trader,
**I want** REST API endpoints to retrieve performance metrics,
**so that** I can analyze strategy performance from external tools or dashboards.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. GET /performance returns performance summary (Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown, returns, etc.)
