5. **FR5**: The platform SHALL support paper trading mode with simulated broker using real market data, realistic latency simulation, and partial fill modeling

6. **FR6**: The platform SHALL implement state management system for live trading with save/restore on shutdown/startup, crash recovery, and position reconciliation with broker

7. **FR7**: The platform SHALL provide data source adapters including extensible adapter framework for data API providers (e.g., Polygon, Alpaca, Alpha Vantage), CCXT (crypto exchanges), YFinance (stocks/ETFs/forex), CSV (custom data import), and WebSocket (real-time streaming)

8. **FR8**: The platform SHALL support multi-resolution time series data from sub-second to monthly bars with automatic aggregation and OHLCV relationship validation

9. **FR9**: The platform SHALL implement realistic transaction cost modeling including latency simulation, partial fills based on volume, multiple slippage models (volume-share, fixed bps, bid-ask spread), tiered commission models, borrow costs for shorts, and overnight financing for leveraged positions

10. **FR10**: The platform SHALL provide multi-strategy portfolio management supporting concurrent strategies with capital allocation algorithms (Fixed, Dynamic, Risk-Parity, Kelly Criterion, Drawdown-Based), cross-strategy risk management, and order aggregation

11. **FR11**: The platform SHALL implement parameter search algorithms including Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Genetic Algorithm with parallel processing support

12. **FR12**: The platform SHALL provide robustness testing and validation tools including walk-forward optimization framework (supporting any search algorithm for time-series train/validation/test), parameter sensitivity/stability analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation with data permutation and noise infusion

13. **FR13**: The platform SHALL implement scheduled calculations for live trading with market open/close triggers, custom time-based triggers, and flexible scheduling expressions

14. **FR14**: The platform SHALL provide advanced performance metrics including returns, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio, maximum drawdown, VaR, CVaR, win rate, profit factor, and performance attribution

15. **FR15**: The platform SHALL implement comprehensive audit logging with structured logs (JSON format) capturing trade-by-trade tracking, strategy decisions, and system events in searchable format

16. **FR16**: The platform SHALL guarantee temporal isolation as a system-wide constraint across all modules (data access, calculations, validations) with strict timestamp validation, forward-looking data prevention, and comprehensive lookahead bias detection tests

17. **FR17**: The platform SHALL provide RESTful API (FastAPI) with endpoints for strategy execution, portfolio queries, order management, performance metrics, and data catalog access with authentication and rate limiting, enabling remote monitoring and multi-user team workflows

18. **FR18**: The platform SHALL provide WebSocket API for real-time updates including live portfolio changes, trade notifications, order fill confirmations, and market data streaming for production deployment monitoring

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR1**: The platform SHALL achieve ≥90% overall test coverage and ≥95% coverage for financial calculation modules, maintaining or improving the forked Zipline-Reloaded baseline of 88.26%

2. **NFR2**: The platform SHALL complete typical backtests (2 years daily data, 50 assets, moderate complexity strategy) with acceptable performance *(target subject to baseline profiling)*

3. **NFR3**: The platform SHALL achieve Decimal arithmetic performance with <30% overhead vs. float-based baseline through strategic Rust optimization of profiled bottlenecks *(target subject to baseline profiling)*

4. **NFR4**: The platform SHALL demonstrate >99% behavioral correlation between backtest mode and paper trading mode for identical strategies (accounting for realistic slippage/commissions)

5. **NFR5**: The platform SHALL achieve zero financial calculation rounding errors as validated by property-based testing (Hypothesis framework)

6. **NFR6**: The platform SHALL support Python 3.12+ with type safety enforced via mypy --strict compliance across the codebase

7. **NFR7**: The platform SHALL achieve 99.9% uptime for live trading engine excluding planned maintenance, with graceful error handling and recovery strategies

8. **NFR8**: The platform SHALL complete walk-forward optimization with reasonable performance for production use *(target subject to baseline profiling)*

9. **NFR9**: The platform SHALL implement multi-layer data validation including schema validation, OHLCV relationship checks, outlier detection, and temporal consistency verification

10. **NFR10**: The platform SHALL provide comprehensive documentation including 100% public API documentation, 30+ tutorial examples, and architecture guide

11. **NFR11**: The platform SHALL support self-hosted deployment with no vendor lock-in, no cloud dependencies for core functionality, and full local development capability

12. **NFR12**: The platform SHALL implement security best practices including credential encryption, input sanitization, API key management, and rate limiting to prevent abuse
