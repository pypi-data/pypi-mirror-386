## Enhancements Implemented

### 1. ✅ Property-Based Tests (Priority: Medium)

**Implementation:**
- Added comprehensive property-based tests using Hypothesis framework
- Tests generate 1000+ random OHLCV examples per test run
- Two test classes covering both daily and minute bars roundtrip validation
- Validates exact Decimal precision preservation for all generated values

**Files Modified:**
- [tests/data/polars/test_parquet_writer.py](../tests/data/polars/test_parquet_writer.py#L317-L523) - Added `TestPropertyBasedOHLCVRoundtrip` class

**Test Coverage:**
