  future:
    - action: "Consider adding visualization helper methods to WalkForwardResult for quick plotting"
      priority: low
      rationale: "Would improve user experience, but not blocking"
    - action: "Consider adding statistical significance tests for parameter stability (e.g., chi-square test for parameter drift)"
      priority: low
      rationale: "Would enhance robustness detection, but current CV-based approach is industry standard"

final_assessment: |
  Exceptional implementation. This is a textbook example of quality software engineering:

  1. **Temporal Integrity**: Lookahead bias prevention is enforced at the data structure level through
     WindowData.__post_init__ validation, making it impossible to create invalid windows.

  2. **Comprehensive Testing**: 19 tests covering all acceptance criteria, including property-based tests
     with Hypothesis to validate temporal invariants across arbitrary parameter ranges.

  3. **Zero-Mock Adherence**: All calculations are real. Window generation uses actual Polars slicing.
     Metrics use statistics module. Parameter stability uses real coefficient of variation.

  4. **Production Ready**: Clear error messages, structured logging, comprehensive documentation,
     full type hints, and integration with existing optimization framework.

  5. **Maintainability**: Clean dataclass hierarchy, clear separation of concerns, excellent docstrings.

  No concerns identified. Ready for production use.
