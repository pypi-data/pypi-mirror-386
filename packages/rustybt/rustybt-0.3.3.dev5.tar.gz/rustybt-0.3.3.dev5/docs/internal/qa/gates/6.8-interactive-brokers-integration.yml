refactoring_performed:
  - file: "rustybt/live/brokers/ib_adapter.py"
    changes:
      - "Removed unused imports: Option, Forex (not used in current implementation)"
      - "Added exception chaining with 'raise...from e' pattern to all 10 exception handlers"
    why: "Comply with ruff B904 linting rule and Python best practices for exception handling. Preserves original exception traceback for debugging."
    how: "Better debugging experience - full exception chain visible in logs. Follows PEP 409 exception chaining guidelines."
    tests_verified: "All 25 unit tests pass after refactoring"

files_modified_during_review:
  - "rustybt/live/brokers/ib_adapter.py (10 exception handlers updated, 2 imports removed)"

next_steps:
  - "Dev to update File List in story to include QA modifications"
  - "Consider addressing future recommendations in subsequent stories"
  - "Integration tests ready for CI/CD when IB mock server or credentials available"
