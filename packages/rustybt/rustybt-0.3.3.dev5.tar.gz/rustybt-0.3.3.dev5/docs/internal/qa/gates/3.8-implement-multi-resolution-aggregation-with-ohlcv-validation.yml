    original_finding: "Outlier detection test fails - test data doesn't generate sufficient variation to trigger z-score threshold"
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Enhanced outlier detection to handle Decimal types by casting to Float64 for statistical calculations. Added NaN filtering to prevent false positives."

    severity: medium
    original_finding: "Duplicate timestamp test fails - validation checks for sorted timestamps before duplicates"
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Updated test to sort timestamps after adding duplicate, ensuring validation checks duplicates rather than sorting order."

    severity: low
    original_finding: "Daily aggregation test has off-by-one error (391 vs 390 bars)"
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Fixed off-by-one error in aggregate_to_daily_bars() by using `< close_time` instead of `<= close_time` (market close is exclusive)."

    severity: low
    original_finding: "Property test for OHLCV relationships fails with edge case: low=90.01 > open=90"
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Added proper constraints to property test using assume() to ensure generated high/low values are consistent with fixed open/close prices."

    original_finding: "Property test for aggregated close fails with 61 bars (edge case at hour boundary)"
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Constrained bar_count to single aggregation period (max 60 minutes) to test single-period close property correctly."

strengths:
  - "Comprehensive implementation of all 10 acceptance criteria"
  - "Excellent use of Polars lazy evaluation and efficient aggregation"
  - "Strong validation framework with OHLCV relationships, outliers, gaps, temporal consistency"
  - "Well-designed test architecture with unit, integration, and property-based tests"
  - "100% compliance with zero-mock enforcement - all real implementations"
