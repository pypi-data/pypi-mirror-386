nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Zero-Mock enforcement: 100% real implementations, no hardcoded values. Benchmarking code uses local file I/O only, no security concerns."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive performance baseline established. 56 benchmarks passing with detailed per-module analysis. Key findings: Metrics (3162% overhead) and data aggregation (14,555% overhead) identified as optimization priorities for Epic 7."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Benchmark framework properly configured with statistical rigor (10 rounds, warmup, calibration). CI/CD integration ensures regression tracking. All results reproducible."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional documentation quality. Clear methodology, comprehensive baseline report, Epic 7 optimization plan. Code well-structured and follows all coding standards."
