  RE-REVIEW SUMMARY: All issues from initial review have been successfully resolved. Gate status
  upgraded from CONCERNS to PASS.

  INITIAL REVIEW (CONCERNS):
  - 18 of 21 ACs met, excellent quality but missing AC #3 (random search)
  - Multiple broken cross-references
  - Quality score: 75/100

  FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
  1. Created random-search.md (559 lines, comprehensive, excellent quality)
     - Sampling strategies: uniform, log-uniform, discrete ✅
     - Sample size determination: detailed guidelines and tables ✅
     - Convergence criteria: multiple approaches documented ✅
     - Bonus content: theoretical background, comparisons, best practices

  2. Created all missing cross-referenced files:
     - walk-forward/windows.md (window sizing strategies)
     - walk-forward/validation.md (OOS validation techniques)
     - analytics/risk/var-cvar.md (VaR and CVaR analysis)
     - analytics/risk/drawdown.md (drawdown analysis)

  3. All navigation links now resolve correctly

  RE-REVIEW RESULTS (PASS):
  - 21 of 21 ACs met (100%) ✅
  - 22 comprehensive documentation files created
  - Zero broken links
  - Consistent exceptional quality maintained across all files
  - Quality score: 95/100

  CONCLUSION:
