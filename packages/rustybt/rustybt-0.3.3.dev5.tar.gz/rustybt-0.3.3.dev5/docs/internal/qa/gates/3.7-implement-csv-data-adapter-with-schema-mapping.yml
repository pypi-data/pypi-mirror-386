# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      No security concerns identified. Input validation through Polars read_csv,
      proper error handling, no SQL injection risk, no arbitrary code execution,
      Decimal precision for financial data integrity.

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Appropriate performance for use case. Uses Polars for efficient CSV parsing
      (5-10x faster than pandas). Test execution shows good performance:
      - Small CSV (5 rows): ~0.02s
      - Delimiter detection: <0.001s
      - Date parsing: <0.005s
      - Schema mapping: <0.001s

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent error handling with detailed exception hierarchy. Comprehensive
      validation (OHLCV relationships, NULL checks, timestamp sorting, duplicates).
      Missing data strategies (fail/skip/interpolate) provide robustness.
      100% test pass rate (24/24 tests).

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent maintainability. 100% type hint coverage, comprehensive docstrings,
      structured logging throughout, clear separation of concerns, modular design.
      509-line user guide with troubleshooting section. Linting passed (ruff).
