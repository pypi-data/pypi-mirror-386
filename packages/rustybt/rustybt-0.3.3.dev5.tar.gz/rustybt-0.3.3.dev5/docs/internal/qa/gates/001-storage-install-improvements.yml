# Non-Functional Requirements Assessment
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security-sensitive operations. Uses standard Python introspection APIs (inspect.stack()). No data persistence of sensitive information. Code capture only stores user's own strategy code."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent performance characteristics:
      - Entry point detection: <15ms average overhead (T023 validates <10ms requirement)
      - 100-iteration optimization: 0.51s total (T052 result)
      - Metadata generation: ~125 µs per operation (benchmark test)
      - No measurable degradation in backtest execution time

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Strong error handling and graceful degradation:
      - Detection failures never raise exceptions
      - Fallback strategies for edge cases (Jupyter, interactive, frozen apps)
      - Comprehensive logging for debugging
      - Thread-safe ID generation for concurrent backtests
      - 39 error path coverage tests ensure robustness

  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      Code quality is excellent BUT documentation incomplete:
      ✅ Type-safe: 100% type hints, mypy --strict compliant (0 errors)
      ✅ Lint-clean: ruff all checks passed
      ✅ Well-structured: Clear separation of concerns, dataclasses for configuration
      ✅ Comprehensive docstrings: Google-style for all public methods
      ✅ Test coverage: 77% (excellent for zero-mock compliance)
      ⚠️ User guide documentation: INCOMPLETE (T092-T099, T076-T080)
      ⚠️ API reference: INCOMPLETE (T097)
      ⚠️ Troubleshooting guide: INCOMPLETE (T098)

# Constitutional Compliance Assessment
constitutional_compliance:
  CR_001_decimal_computing:
    applicable: false
    status: N/A
    notes: "Feature does not involve financial calculations"

  CR_002_zero_mock:
    applicable: true
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Exemplary zero-mock compliance:
      - All 111 tests use real filesystem operations (tempfile, tmp_path fixtures)
      - Entry point detection uses real inspect.stack() introspection
      - No mocking frameworks used (no unittest.mock, no pytest-mock)
      - YAML parsing uses real PyYAML library
      - Integration tests use real BacktestArtifactManager instances
      - Error path tests use real exception scenarios

  CR_003_strategy_reusability:
    applicable: true
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      100% backward compatibility maintained:
      - YAML precedence preserved (explicit config always wins)
      - No changes to TradingAlgorithm API or run_algorithm() interface
      - Existing YAML configurations work without modification (T022 validates)
      - Code capture behavior identical across backtest/paper/live modes
      - Live trading mode disables code capture (existing behavior unchanged)

  CR_004_type_safety:
    applicable: true
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Strict type safety achieved:
      - 100% type hint coverage for all new code
      - Python 3.12+ modern syntax (PEP 604 union types: X | None)
      - mypy --strict compliance: 0 errors in modified modules
      - Dataclasses for type-safe configuration (EntryPointDetectionResult, CodeCaptureConfiguration)
      - Google-style docstrings with Args, Returns, Raises sections
      - ruff linting: All checks passed
      - black formatting: Compliant

  CR_005_TDD:
    applicable: true
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Excellent test-driven development:
      - Tests written before/alongside implementation (T010-T023 before T024-T049)
      - 97 tests for User Story 1 (84 unit + 6 integration + 7 optimization)
      - 14 tests for User Story 2 (package configuration)
      - 77% code coverage (excellent for zero-mock real-implementation testing)
      - Test organization mirrors source structure
      - Comprehensive edge case coverage (Jupyter, interactive, frozen, errors)
      - Performance tests validate SC-002 (<2% variance requirement)

  CR_006_data_architecture:
    applicable: false
    status: N/A
    notes: "Feature manages code file storage, not OHLCV data processing"

  CR_007_sprint_debug:
    applicable: true
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      Good discipline, but incomplete:
      ✅ Pre-flight checklist completed
      ✅ Existing code reviewed
      ✅ Constitution and standards reviewed
      ✅ Active session documentation maintained (docs/internal/sprint-debug/fixes/active-session.md)
      ✅ Implementation tracked systematically
      ✅ Verification checklist partially completed (T050-T060)
      ⚠️ Phase FINAL constitution verification NOT completed
      ⚠️ Final sign-off checklist NOT completed
      ⚠️ Documentation updates NOT completed
