schema: 1
story: "6.2"
story_title: "Implement Event-Driven Async Trading Engine Core"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested. AC8 gap closed with comprehensive integration test suite (6 scenarios). Unit tests passing (35/35). Performance exceeds requirements (10x). Code quality excellent with proper async architecture, type safety, and structured logging."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful error handling, no crashes from handler exceptions, thread-safe state management via asyncio.Lock"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns, comprehensive docstrings, type hints throughout, structured logging"
