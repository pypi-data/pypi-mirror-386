nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No hardcoded credentials, proper CSV validation (rate bounds 0-100%), structured logging without sensitive data exposure. Custom exceptions for error handling.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Efficient Polars DataFrames for CSV operations with rate caching. O(n) financing calculations (unavoidable). Property tests with 1000+ examples complete in <0.4s. Decimal precision overhead acceptable for financial accuracy.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with specific exceptions (FinancingRateLoadError, FinancingCalculationError). Graceful degradation with default rates. Warning logs for missing data. Decimal precision eliminates rounding errors. Chronological date validation prevents data integrity issues.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Protocol-based extensibility (FinancingRateProvider). Clean separation between rate providers, models, and integration. Comprehensive documentation including module docstrings, tutorial, and CSV examples. Clear code organization.'

completed_improvements:
  - improvement: 'Added explicit cash_used field to DecimalPosition with leverage properties'
    completed_date: '2025-10-02'
    files: ['rustybt/finance/decimal/position.py']
    validation: 'New properties: is_leveraged, leverage_ratio, leveraged_exposure. Validated by test_position_leverage_properties and test_position_cash_used_field_integration.'

    completed_date: '2025-10-02'
    files: ['rustybt/finance/costs.py']
    validation: 'CSVBorrowRateProvider and CSVFinancingRateProvider now include _validate_chronological_dates(). Validated by test_csv_chronological_date_validation and test_csv_financing_chronological_date_validation.'
