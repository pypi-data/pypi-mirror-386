# Detailed assessment
assessment:
  strengths:
    - "Comprehensive 882-line architecture analysis covering all 12 major modules (~54,000 LOC)"
    - "6 major extension points identified with concrete code examples and integration strategies"
    - "Multiple Mermaid diagrams for module dependencies, event flow, and data flow"
    - "Test coverage analysis (88.26% baseline) with safe modification zones clearly marked"
    - "Three safe modification patterns documented (Parallel Implementation, Subclass Extension, Interface Implementation)"
    - "Clear roadmap for Epic 2-5 implementation with file locations and line numbers"
    - "Executive summary provides quick overview while detailed sections allow deep-dive"
    - "All file references validated against actual Zipline-Reloaded structure"

  weaknesses: []  # No weaknesses identified

  opportunities:
    - "Documentation quality can serve as template for future architectural analyses"
    - "Extension patterns can be extracted into reusable design guide"
    - "Test coverage analysis methodology can be applied to future stories"

# Test architecture assessment
test_architecture:
  coverage_adequacy: "N/A - Documentation story requires no tests"
  test_design_quality: "N/A - Documentation story"
  edge_case_coverage: "N/A - Documentation story"
  notes: "Documentation validates Zipline-Reloaded's existing 88.26% test coverage baseline and identifies safe modification zones for future development."

# Technical debt
technical_debt:
  introduced: "None"
  mitigated: "Documentation actually reduces future technical debt by clearly identifying safe modification zones and extension patterns"
  notes: "Three safe modification patterns prevent architectural violations. Test coverage analysis guides developers toward low-risk extension points."
