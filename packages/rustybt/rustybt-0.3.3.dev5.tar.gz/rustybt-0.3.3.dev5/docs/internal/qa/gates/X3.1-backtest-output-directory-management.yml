refactoring_performed:
  - file: rustybt/backtest/artifact_manager.py
    change: Added type narrowing assertion
    why: Resolve mypy type hint issue with Optional[str]
    how: Added "assert self._backtest_id is not None" after generation
    impact: Improved type safety, no runtime behavior change

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding backtest_id to all subsequent log messages automatically"
      refs: ["rustybt/backtest/artifact_manager.py"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Would improve log traceability across backtest lifecycle"

    - action: "Consider adding cleanup utility for old backtest directories"
      refs: ["rustybt/backtest/"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Helpful for managing disk space with many backtests"

test_architecture_assessment:
  strengths:
    - "Comprehensive test coverage across all levels (unit/integration/performance)"
    - "Property-based thinking evident in uniqueness and concurrency tests"
    - "Performance requirements validated with benchmark tests"
    - "Edge cases well covered (disabled mode, permission errors, concurrent execution)"

zero_mock_compliance:
  status: PASS
  notes: |
    - No mocks in production code
    - Minimal mocking in tests (only for filesystem permissions and TradingAlgorithm dependencies)
    - All core functionality uses real implementations
    - Test fixtures use actual temporary directories

backward_compatibility:
  status: VERIFIED
  notes: |
    - Artifact management enabled by default but can be disabled
    - Automatically disabled for live_trading=True
    - No breaking changes to TradingAlgorithm API
    - Integration tests verify existing code continues to work
