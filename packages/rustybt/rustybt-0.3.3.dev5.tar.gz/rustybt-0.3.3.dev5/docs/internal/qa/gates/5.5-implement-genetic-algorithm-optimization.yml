    action: "Pickle security advisory resolved"
    details: |
      - Added comprehensive security warnings to set_state() docstring
      - Implemented pre-unpickle validation (key checks, parameter range validation)
      - Added post-unpickle validation (population size consistency)
      - Added error handling with clear messages for corrupted/malicious state
      - Added security note to get_state() docstring
      - Created 2 new tests validating security checks
      - All 39 tests passing

# Detailed recommendations

  future:
    - action: "Consider documenting checkpoint file security in user-facing documentation"
      refs: ["rustybt/optimization/search/genetic_algorithm.py:759"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Pickle security is already documented in code comments, but user docs could clarify"

    - action: "Optional: Simplify parameter range normalization (lines 584-587)"
      refs: ["rustybt/optimization/search/genetic_algorithm.py:584-587"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Linting suggests combining if branches. Current code favors readability."

# Test architecture assessment
test_architecture:
  coverage_level: excellent  # 37 tests, estimated >95% code coverage
  test_types:
    unit: 29  # Operator tests, initialization, getters
    integration: 6  # Full evolution loops, state management
    property: 2  # Hypothesis tests for invariants

  strengths:
    - "Comprehensive operator testing (selection, crossover, mutation, elitism)"
    - "Property-based testing validates bounds and reproducibility"
    - "Zero-mock enforcement - all tests use real DEAP operators"
    - "Edge case coverage (validation errors, termination criteria, diversity warnings)"
    - "State management tested (checkpoint/resume)"

  observations:
    - "Test organization is excellent with clear class-based grouping"
    - "Test names clearly describe what is being validated"
    - "Good mix of positive tests and error case validation"
