review_details:
  strengths:
    - "Exemplary interface design using ABC with four core methods (fetch, ingest_to_bundle, get_metadata, supports_live)"
    - "Comprehensive Google-style docstrings with usage examples"
    - "Elegant auto-discovery pattern via __subclasses__() with recursive traversal"
    - "Perfect backwards compatibility maintained (fetch_ohlcv alias)"
    - "100% type hint coverage with proper async/await usage"
    - "Frozen dataclasses ensure immutability"
    - "Structured logging throughout (structlog)"
    - "Proper Decimal precision for financial calculations"
    - "Excellent ADR documentation (001-unified-data-source-abstraction.md)"
    - "CLI commands functional with --list-sources and --source-info flags"
    - "All 6 adapters successfully implement interface using multiple inheritance without MRO conflicts"

  improvements_made_during_review:
    - "Fixed CLI validation to allow --list-sources and --source-info without requiring bundle/symbols/dates"
    - "Added proper early return in --source-info handler to prevent spurious error messages"
    - "Verified test suite still passes after CLI improvements (15/17 passing)"

  areas_for_future_work:
    - "Integration tests for end-to-end bundle creation (scoped for Stories 8.3-8.5)"
    - "Property-based tests for metadata validation (nice-to-have)"
    - "Performance benchmarks for registry discovery overhead (nice-to-have)"

    changes: "Changed required=True to required=False for bundle/symbols/start/end options, added early return in --source-info handler, added validation checks for actual ingestion"
    reason: "Allow --list-sources and --source-info to work without ingestion parameters"
    impact: "Low - improves UX without changing core functionality"
