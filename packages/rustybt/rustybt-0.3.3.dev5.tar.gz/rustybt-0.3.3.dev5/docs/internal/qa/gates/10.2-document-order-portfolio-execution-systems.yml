# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "14 comprehensive documentation files (9,199 lines) covering all aspects of order and portfolio management"
    - "95+ realistic code examples demonstrating practical trading scenarios"
    - "Follows established documentation patterns from Story 10.1 exactly"
    - "Prominent risk warnings (⚠️) and best practices (✅/❌) throughout"
    - "Effective navigation with README files and cross-references"
    - "Architecture diagrams for complex systems (order flow, portfolio, multi-strategy)"
    - "Realistic parameter values with broker/exchange comparisons"
    - "Comprehensive troubleshooting sections"
    - "Code validation summary with manual review completed"
    - "All 17 acceptance criteria fully satisfied"

  areas_for_improvement: []

  optional_enhancements:
    - "Add automated testing of code examples to CI/CD pipeline"
    - "Add automated import validation script"
    - "Consider adding advanced topics in future iterations (VaR, correlation metrics, corporate actions, performance interpretation guides)"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues

  future:  # Optional enhancements for future iterations
    - action: "Add automated testing of code examples via CI/CD"
      refs: ["docs/api/order-management/CODE_EXAMPLES_VALIDATION.md"]
      rationale: "Automated testing would complement manual validation and catch regressions"
    - action: "Add automated import validation script"
      refs: ["docs/api/order-management/", "docs/api/portfolio-management/"]
      rationale: "Ensures code examples remain valid as APIs evolve"
    - action: "Consider advanced topics for future documentation iterations"
      refs: ["Story 10.2 unchecked tasks"]
      rationale: "Corporate actions, advanced risk metrics, and interpretation guides are useful but not required for current ACs"
