overall_assessment: |
  Story 5.4 delivers a high-quality, production-ready Bayesian optimization implementation.
  The code is well-architected, thoroughly tested, and comprehensively documented.

  Key Highlights:
  - All 10 acceptance criteria fully met and tested
  - 25 tests pass including unit, integration, and property-based tests
  - Example demonstrates 71% improvement over Random Search
  - Convergence detection working correctly (converged at iteration 27/50)
  - Excellent documentation explains when/how to use Bayesian optimization

  Minor Issues:
  - 5 ruff code style warnings (none blocking)
  - Pickle deserialization security assumption needs documentation

  The gate is CONCERNS only due to the pickle security consideration requiring
  documentation. This is a trivial fix that should take <5 minutes.

  After addressing the security documentation, this story is ready for production.
