strengths:
  - "Comprehensive scenario matrix design (15 prioritized from 36 scenarios)"
  - "Excellent documentation (README.md 472 lines, benchmarking-suite.md 379 lines)"
  - "Clean architecture with factory pattern and separation of concerns"
  - "Deterministic design with seed=42 for reproducibility"
  - "Proper CI/CD integration with regression detection and alerting"
  - "Historical tracking with retention policy and query tools"
  - "Memory profiling with appropriate sanity checks"
  - "Graceful error handling with pytest.skip for missing dependencies"

concerns: []  # All previous concerns resolved

resolved_issues:
  - "✅ Core backtest execution now implemented with run_algorithm() integration"
  - "✅ Two critical bugs (BUG-001, BUG-002) fixed during initial review"
  - "✅ All documented scripts now implemented (compare_benchmarks.py, query_history.py --summary)"
  - "✅ Symbol naming aligned with profiling bundles (ASSET→SYM)"
  - "✅ Import structure improved (absolute imports throughout)"
  - "✅ Type safety enhanced (proper Decimal/float conversions)"
