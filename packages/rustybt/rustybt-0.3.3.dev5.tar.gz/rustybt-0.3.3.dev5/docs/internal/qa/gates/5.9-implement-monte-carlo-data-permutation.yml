# Review summary
review_summary: |
  This is an exemplary implementation that sets a quality standard for the project.

  Highlights:
  - All 10 acceptance criteria fully satisfied
  - 35 tests (unit, integration, property-based) all passing
  - Proper statistical implementation of permutation and bootstrap methods
  - Correct use of Decimal throughout for financial precision
  - Comprehensive documentation with interpretation guidelines
  - Zero technical debt
  - Production-ready code

  The implementation demonstrates mastery of:
  - Statistical computing (Monte Carlo, permutation testing)
  - Financial precision handling (Decimal)
  - Python best practices (type hints, docstrings, immutability)
  - Test-driven development (property-based testing)
  - Zero-mock discipline

  No refactoring or improvements needed. Ready for production deployment.
