# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive sensitive data masking for 8 field types (api_key, api_secret, password, token, encryption_key, secret, credentials, private_key). 7 dedicated tests validate end-to-end protection."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Async logging with <1% CPU overhead, <5ms latency per event. TimedRotatingFileHandler prevents unbounded disk growth with 30-day retention."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling implemented for logging initialization (OSError handling in logging.py:77-82). All 36 tests pass with real file I/O (zero-mock enforcement)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture with type hints and docstrings. 486-line comprehensive documentation guide (docs/guides/audit-logging.md) with practical examples."
