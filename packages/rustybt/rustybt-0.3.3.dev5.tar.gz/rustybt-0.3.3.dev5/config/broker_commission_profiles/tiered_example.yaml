  Example tiered commission structure based on monthly trading volume.

  Tier breakdown:
  - Base tier (0 - $100k): 0.10% per trade
  - Tier 2 ($100k - $1M): 0.05% per trade (50% discount)
  - Tier 3 ($1M+): 0.02% per trade (80% discount)

  Examples:
  Month start (base tier):
  - Trade $10,000: Commission = $10,000 × 0.001 = $10.00
  - Trade $50,000: Commission = $50,000 × 0.001 = $50.00
  - Trade $50,000: Commission = $50,000 × 0.001 = $50.00
  Total volume: $110,000 → Now at Tier 2

  After reaching Tier 2:
  - Trade $100,000: Commission = $100,000 × 0.0005 = $50.00
  Total volume: $210,000

  After reaching Tier 3 ($1M+ traded):
  - Trade $500,000: Commission = $500,000 × 0.0002 = $100.00

  Volume tracking resets monthly.
  Tiers are applied based on accumulated volume at trade time.
