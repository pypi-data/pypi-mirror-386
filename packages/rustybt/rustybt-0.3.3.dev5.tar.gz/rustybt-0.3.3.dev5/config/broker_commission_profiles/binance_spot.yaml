notes: |
  Binance Spot Trading Commission (VIP 0 - Regular users).

  Examples:
  - Buy 0.1 BTC @ $30,000 (market order):
    Trade value = $3,000
    Commission = $3,000 × 0.001 = $3.00 (taker)

  - Sell 1.0 ETH @ $2,000 (limit order that rests):
    Trade value = $2,000
    Commission = $2,000 × 0.001 = $2.00 (maker)

  Using BNB for fees reduces commission by 25% (not modeled here).
  VIP levels unlock with 30-day trading volume + BNB holdings.
