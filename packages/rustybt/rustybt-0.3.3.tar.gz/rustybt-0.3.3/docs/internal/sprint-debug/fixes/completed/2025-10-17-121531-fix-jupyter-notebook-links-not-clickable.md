**Focus Area:** Documentation

## ⚠️ MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

### For Documentation Updates: Pre-Flight Checklist

- [x] **Content verified in source code**
  - [x] Located source implementation: `docs/examples/notebooks/` directory
  - [x] Confirmed functionality exists as will be documented (all 13 .ipynb files exist)
  - [x] Understand actual behavior (notebook files present but links were plain text)

- [x] **Technical accuracy verified**
  - [x] ALL code examples tested and working (N/A - this is link formatting fix)
  - [x] ALL API signatures match source code exactly (N/A - this is link formatting fix)
  - [x] ALL import paths tested and working (N/A - this is link formatting fix)
  - [x] NO fabricated content - all 13 notebooks verified to exist on disk

- [x] **Example quality verified**
  - [x] Examples use realistic data (N/A - documentation fix)
  - [x] Examples are copy-paste executable (link format is standard markdown)
  - [x] Examples demonstrate best practices (markdown link syntax is best practice)
  - [x] Complex examples include explanatory comments (N/A - link formatting)

- [x] **Quality standards compliance**
  - [x] Read `DOCUMENTATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`
  - [x] Read `coding-standards.md` (N/A - documentation only)
  - [x] Commit to zero documentation debt
  - [x] Will NOT use syntax inference without verification (verified all files exist)

- [x] **Cross-references and context**
  - [x] Identified related documentation to update (only README.md in notebooks directory)
  - [x] Checked for outdated information (descriptions are current)
  - [x] Verified terminology consistency (consistent naming with actual files)
  - [x] No broken links (all links point to existing .ipynb files in same directory)

- [x] **Testing preparation**
  - [x] Testing environment ready (N/A - documentation formatting fix)
  - [x] Test data available and realistic (N/A - link formatting)
  - [x] Can validate documentation builds (markdown syntax validated)

**Documentation Pre-Flight Complete**: [x] YES [ ] NO

**Issues Found:**
1. Notebook names not clickable in `docs/examples/notebooks/README.md` - lines 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 71, 76
2. User reported inability to open notebooks directly from documentation
3. Plain text notebook names instead of markdown links reduces usability

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Why did this issue occur: Documentation created with plain text file names instead of markdown links
- What pattern should prevent recurrence: Always verify documentation links are clickable during creation, include link check in pre-flight checklist

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Converted all 13 notebook names to clickable markdown links** - `docs/examples/notebooks/README.md`
   - Changed format from `**filename.ipynb**` to `[**filename.ipynb**](filename.ipynb)`
   - Applied to all notebooks: crypto_backtest_ccxt, equity_backtest_yfinance, 01-11 notebooks
   - Links are relative (same directory), so they work in both GitHub and MkDocs
   - Preserved all formatting (bold text, numbering, descriptions)

**Tests Added/Modified:**
- N/A (documentation-only change)

**Documentation Updated:**
- `docs/examples/notebooks/README.md` - Converted 13 notebook names to clickable links (lines 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 71, 76)

**Verification:**
- [x] All tests pass (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Linting passes (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Type checking passes (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Black formatting check passes (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Documentation builds without warnings (markdown syntax valid)
- [x] No zero-mock violations detected (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Manual testing completed with realistic data (verified all 13 .ipynb files exist on disk)
- [x] Appropriate pre-flight checklist completed above

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/examples/notebooks/README.md` - Made all 13 notebook filenames clickable links

**Statistics:**
- Issues found: 3
- Issues fixed: 3
- Tests added: 0
- Code coverage change: 0%
- Lines changed: +13/-13

**Commit Hash:** `8afbcc9`
**Branch:** `main`
**PR Number:** N/A (direct commit)

**Notes:**
- Links are relative, work in both GitHub and rendered documentation
- All 13 notebooks confirmed to exist before creating links
- User can now click notebook names to open them directly
- Fix improves documentation usability significantly
