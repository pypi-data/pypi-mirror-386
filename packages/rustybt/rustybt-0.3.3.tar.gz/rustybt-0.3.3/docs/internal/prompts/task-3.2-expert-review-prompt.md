# Expert Review Request - Story 11.1: Documentation Quality Framework

## Context

You are being asked to perform an expert review of the Documentation Quality Framework created for RustyBT in Story 11.1. This is a **critical review** that determines whether the framework is ready for use in Epic 11 documentation stories (11.2, 11.3, 11.4).

**Your Role**: Expert Developer / Framework Reviewer
**Review Type**: Documentation Quality Framework Validation
**Story**: 11.1 - Documentation Quality Framework & Reorganization
**Duration**: 1-3 hours
**Deliverable**: Completed expert review with approval decision

---

## Review Objective

Validate that the Documentation Quality Framework:
1. **Is technically sound** - Standards and processes are appropriate
2. **Is comprehensive** - Covers all necessary quality aspects
3. **Is practical** - Can be realistically followed by documentation creators
4. **Is enforceable** - Has proper automation and checkpoints
5. **Prevents Epic 10 issues** - Addresses root causes of previous documentation problems

---

## What to Review

### Primary Documents (REQUIRED)

1. **Quality Standards**
   - File: `docs/internal/DOCUMENTATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`
   - Focus: Are the 6 core principles appropriate? Are standards achievable?

2. **Creation Checklist**
   - File: `docs/internal/DOCUMENTATION_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Focus: Is this checklist comprehensive? Will it catch issues before they occur?

3. **Validation Checklist**
   - File: `docs/internal/DOCUMENTATION_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Focus: Does this checklist catch all quality issues? Are quality gates appropriate?

4. **Expert Review Process**
   - File: `docs/internal/EXPERT_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`
   - Focus: Is the review workflow practical? Are time estimates realistic?

5. **Usage Guide**
   - File: `docs/internal/QUALITY_FRAMEWORK_USAGE_GUIDE.md`
   - Focus: Is this guide clear and actionable? Can documentation creators follow it?

6. **Automation Script**
   - File: `scripts/verify_documented_apis.py`
   - Action: Review code AND execute it
   - Command: `python3 scripts/verify_documented_apis.py --help`
   - Focus: Does automation effectively validate documentation quality?

7. **Artifact Infrastructure**
   - Location: `docs/internal/story-artifacts/`
   - Focus: Is the structure logical? Are templates complete?

### Testing Evidence (RECOMMENDED)

8. **Framework Testing Report**
   - File: `docs/internal/story-artifacts/11.1-framework-testing-report.md`
   - Focus: Were tests comprehensive? Are results credible?

---

## Review Process

### Step 1: Read Core Documents (30-45 minutes)

Read these documents in order:
1. `DOCUMENTATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` - Understand quality expectations
2. `DOCUMENTATION_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre-flight requirements
3. `DOCUMENTATION_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Validation requirements
4. `QUALITY_FRAMEWORK_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Complete workflow

### Step 2: Test Automation (15-30 minutes)

Execute the verification script:
```bash
# View help
python3 scripts/verify_documented_apis.py --help

# Run on existing documentation (should reveal Epic 10 issues)
python3 scripts/verify_documented_apis.py

# Review JSON report
cat scripts/api_verification_report.json | head -100
```

Assess:
- Does the script work correctly?
- Does it catch real issues?
- Are results actionable?

### Step 3: Review Process Documents (15-30 minutes)

Read:
- `EXPERT_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` - Is this workflow practical?
- `story-artifacts/README.md` - Is infrastructure clear?
- Review templates in `story-artifacts/templates/`

### Step 4: Critical Analysis (30-60 minutes)

Ask yourself:
- **Could this framework have prevented Epic 10's issues?**
- **Is this framework too complex or too simple?**
- **Are there gaps or missing components?**
- **Will documentation creators actually follow this?**
- **Is the automation sufficient?**

### Step 5: Complete Review Template (15-30 minutes)
