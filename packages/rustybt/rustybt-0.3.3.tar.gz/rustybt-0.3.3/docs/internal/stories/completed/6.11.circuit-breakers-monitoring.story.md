4. ErrorRateCircuitBreaker halts on repeated errors (e.g., 10 order rejections in 1 minute)
5. Manual circuit breaker (emergency stop button or API endpoint)
6. Circuit breaker state tracked (NORMAL, TRIPPED, MANUALLY_HALTED)
7. Alert system (email, SMS, webhook) when circuit breaker trips
8. Monitoring dashboard (optional Streamlit/Grafana) shows live positions, PnL, circuit breaker status
9. Tests validate circuit breakers trip correctly under adverse conditions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 6.1: Design Live Trading Engine Architecture]
- Circuit breakers design: drawdown, daily loss, order rate, error rate
- Alert system for circuit breaker trips (email, SMS, webhook)
- Monitoring dashboard (optional Streamlit/Grafana)
- Circuit breaker state tracking (NORMAL, TRIPPED, MANUALLY_HALTED)

[From Story 6.2: Implement Event-Driven Async Trading Engine Core]
- Event system for CircuitBreakerTrippedEvent
- Order submission blocking when circuit breaker active
- Graceful shutdown integration

### Architecture Context

**Circuit Breaker Design:**
[Source: docs/architecture/live-trading.md (from Story 6.1)]
- DrawdownCircuitBreaker: Halt if portfolio drawdown exceeds threshold (e.g., -10%)
- DailyLossCircuitBreaker: Halt if daily loss exceeds limit
- OrderRateCircuitBreaker: Prevent runaway order submission (max 100 orders/minute)
- ErrorRateCircuitBreaker: Halt on repeated errors (10 order rejections in 1 minute)
- Manual circuit breaker: Emergency stop button or API endpoint
- Alert system: Email, SMS, webhook on trip

**Monitoring Integration:**
[Source: Epic 6 PRD Story 6.11]
- Monitoring dashboard (optional Streamlit/Grafana) shows live positions, PnL, circuit breaker status
- Real-time metrics: portfolio value, positions, orders, errors
- Manual halt capability via dashboard

**Tech Stack:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python Decimal for portfolio calculations
- SMTP for email alerts
- Twilio API for SMS alerts (optional)
- Streamlit for optional dashboard
- Grafana for production monitoring (alternative)

**Streamlit Dependency (Optional):** Streamlit is optional for dashboard (not in core tech stack). Install with: pip install streamlit. Dashboard can be run separately: streamlit run rustybt/live/dashboard.py. For production, Grafana integration is recommended (documented as alternative).

**Coding Standards:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Type hints: mypy --strict compliance
- Structured logging for circuit breaker events
- Error handling: CircuitBreakerError for trip conditions
- Immutable state tracking for circuit breaker status

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Circuit breakers: `rustybt/live/circuit_breakers.py`
- Alert manager: `rustybt/live/alerts.py`
- Dashboard: `rustybt/live/dashboard.py` (optional Streamlit app)
- Events: `rustybt/live/events.py` (CircuitBreakerTrippedEvent, ManualHaltEvent)
- Tests: `tests/live/test_circuit_breakers.py`, `tests/live/test_alerts.py`
- Documentation: `docs/architecture/live-trading.md` (add circuit breakers section)

### Integration Points
- LiveTradingEngine: Monitors circuit breakers, blocks orders when tripped
- DecimalLedger: Provides portfolio value for drawdown calculation
- OrderManager: Provides order count for rate limiting
- EventQueue: Dispatches CircuitBreakerTrippedEvent
- AlertManager: Sends alerts on circuit breaker trips
- Scheduler: Resets daily loss at market open

### Circuit Breaker Configuration Examples

**Conservative (Low Risk Tolerance):**
```python
circuit_breakers = {
    "drawdown": {"threshold": -0.05},  # -5% drawdown
    "daily_loss": {"limit": -0.02},    # -2% daily loss
    "order_rate": {"max_orders": 50, "window": 60},  # 50 orders/minute
    "error_rate": {"max_errors": 5, "window": 60}    # 5 errors/minute
}
```

**Moderate (Balanced Risk):**
```python
circuit_breakers = {
    "drawdown": {"threshold": -0.10},  # -10% drawdown
    "daily_loss": {"limit": -0.05},    # -5% daily loss
    "order_rate": {"max_orders": 100, "window": 60},  # 100 orders/minute
    "error_rate": {"max_errors": 10, "window": 60}    # 10 errors/minute
}
```

**Aggressive (High Risk Tolerance):**
```python
circuit_breakers = {
    "drawdown": {"threshold": -0.20},  # -20% drawdown
    "daily_loss": {"limit": -0.10},    # -10% daily loss
    "order_rate": {"max_orders": 200, "window": 60},  # 200 orders/minute
    "error_rate": {"max_errors": 20, "window": 60}    # 20 errors/minute
}
```
