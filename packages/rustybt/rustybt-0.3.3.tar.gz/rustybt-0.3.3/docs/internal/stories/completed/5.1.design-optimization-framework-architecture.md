## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** architectural design for optimization framework with pluggable search algorithms,
**so that** implementation follows cohesive design with clear separation of concerns.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Interface contracts defined for SearchAlgorithm base class (required methods: suggest, update, is_complete)
3. ParameterSpace design (support continuous, discrete, categorical parameters)
4. Parallel execution architecture designed (Ray for distributed, multiprocessing for local)
5. Result storage design (optimization history, parameter→result mapping, best parameters tracking)
6. Checkpoint/resume support designed (save/restore optimization progress)
7. Integration with backtest engine defined (how optimization runs backtests with different parameters)
8. Architecture documentation saved to docs/architecture/optimization.md
9. Design reviewed for extensibility (easy to add new search algorithms)
10. Design approved before implementation begins

```

### Data Models and Validation
[Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#L42)]
- Use **pydantic 2.x+** for parameter space validation and configuration
- Define dataclasses for ParameterSpace, OptimizationResult, SearchAlgorithm config
- Use type hints extensively for all interfaces

### Integration with Backtest Engine
The optimization framework must integrate with the existing TradingAlgorithm backtest engine:
- Load strategy with different parameter sets
- Execute backtest via `run_algorithm()` API
- Extract objective metrics from backtest results (Sharpe ratio, total return, etc.)
- Handle backtest failures gracefully (invalid parameters, data issues)

### Parallel Processing Strategy
[Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#L40)]
- **Local**: Use `multiprocessing` module for CPU-bound parallel backtests
- **Distributed** (Optional): Use Ray for scaling across multiple machines
- Design must support both modes with minimal code changes
- Thread-safe result aggregation required

### Performance Considerations
- Optimization runs will execute many backtests (100s to 1000s)
- Each backtest is CPU-intensive
- Parallel execution essential for reasonable completion times
- Checkpoint/resume support critical for long-running optimizations

### Checkpoint/Resume Design Strategy
[Source: AC 6]
**Architecture Decision**: Separate concerns between SearchAlgorithm state and persistence:

**SearchAlgorithm Responsibility** (Stories 5.2-5.5):
- Maintain serializable internal state (population, history, counters, etc.)
- Implement state getters/setters for persistence
- Focus on algorithm logic, not file I/O

**Optimizer Wrapper Responsibility** (This story):
- Handle checkpoint file creation/management
- Serialize/deserialize SearchAlgorithm state
- Support checkpoint frequency configuration (every N iterations, time-based)
- Provide resume functionality (detect checkpoint, load state, continue)

**Benefits**:
- Keeps algorithm implementations simple and focused
- Consistent checkpoint format across all algorithms
- Easy to add new algorithms (just maintain state, don't handle persistence)
- Centralized error handling for file operations

### Extensibility Requirements
[Source: AC 9]
New search algorithms must be easy to add:
- Implement SearchAlgorithm abstract base class
- Register with Optimizer
- No changes to core Optimizer logic required

### Architecture Documentation Location
[Source: AC 8]
Documentation must be saved to: `docs/architecture/optimization.md`

### Design Approval Process
[Source: AC 10]
- Create architecture document with diagrams
- Submit for review to senior developer
- Address feedback
- Get explicit approval before Stories 5.2-5.10 begin

### Testing

#### Test File Location
[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#L441-L444)]

- Test naming: `test_<module>.py`
- Test functions: `test_<function_name>_<scenario>`

#### Testing Standards
[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#L3-L7)]
- **Overall Coverage**: ≥90%
- **New Components**: ≥90% strict enforcement
- This is a design story, so testing focuses on validating design decisions through proof-of-concept code

#### Test Types for Design Validation
[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#L11-L24)]
- **Unit Tests**: Validate interface contracts and core abstractions
- **Integration Tests**: Validate backtest engine integration with sample optimization
- **Property Tests**: Validate parameter space invariants

#### No Mocking Allowed
[Source: [coding-standards.md](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#L137-L212)]
- **Zero-Mock Enforcement**: All tests must exercise real functionality
- No hardcoded return values in validation functions
- All validations must perform actual checks
- Design validation tests should run simple but real optimizations

**AC10: Design approval** ⚠️ Pending
- Design ready for review (AC marked incomplete in story)
- Senior developer review and approval still needed

### Test Coverage Gaps

**None** - 95.3% coverage with comprehensive test scenarios:
- Parameter validation (bounds, types, constraints)
- Optimization loop execution
- Checkpoint/resume functionality
- Error handling (failed backtests)
- State serialization round-trips
- Best result tracking
- History management

Uncovered lines are minor edge cases (exception branches, optional features).

### Security Review

**No Security Concerns**

This is a design/framework story with no security-sensitive operations:
- No authentication or authorization
- No external API calls or network operations
- No user input handling (parameters validated via pydantic)
- Checkpoint files use local filesystem only
- Random seed handling appropriate for optimization (not cryptographic use)

Note: S311 ruff warning about `random.Random` for parameter sampling is acceptable - this is not security-critical randomness.

### Performance Considerations

**Excellent Performance Design**

- Lazy evaluation strategy allows efficient parameter space exploration
- Checkpoint system prevents work loss in long optimizations
- Decimal precision maintained without unnecessary conversions
- Immutable dataclasses prevent accidental mutations
- Test suite runs in 0.09s (fast feedback loop)

**Future Optimization Opportunities** (Story 5.6):
- Parallel execution currently sequential (1 worker)
- Ray integration designed but not yet implemented
- Batch evaluation could reduce overhead
