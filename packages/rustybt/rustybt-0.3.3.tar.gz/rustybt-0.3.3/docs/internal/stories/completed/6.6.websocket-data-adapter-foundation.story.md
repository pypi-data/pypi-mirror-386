## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 6.1: Design Live Trading Engine Architecture]
- WebSocket streaming foundation for real-time data (deferred from Epic 3)
- BaseStreamAdapter for standardizing exchange WebSocket messages
- Buffering system to accumulate ticks into OHLCV bars

[From Story 6.5: Scheduled Calculations]
- Event system already in place for scheduled triggers
- Integration point for real-time data event triggering

**Note:** This story is now Story 6.6, positioned before Paper Trading (6.7) to provide WebSocket foundation for real-time data.

### Architecture Context

**WebSocket Streaming Design:**
[Source: architecture/external-api-integration.md#websocket-streaming-epic-6]
- Supported brokers: Binance (wss://stream.binance.com:9443), Bybit, Hyperliquid, IB
- Features: orderbook updates, trade stream, kline/candlestick stream, account updates
- Connection management: auto-reconnect, heartbeat, subscription management

**Data Adapter Pattern:**
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#data-adapter-components]
- BaseDataAdapter: Extensible framework for data sources
- Standard schema: timestamp, symbol, open, high, low, close, volume (Decimal columns)
- Validation: OHLCV relationships, outlier detection, temporal consistency

**Tech Stack:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#new-technology-additions]
- websockets 14.x+ for WebSocket streaming
- asyncio for async connection management
- Python Decimal for price and volume data
- Pydantic for message validation

**Coding Standards:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Type hints: mypy --strict compliance
- Async/await for all WebSocket operations
- Structured logging for connection events and errors
- Error handling: WebSocketError, ConnectionError, ParseError

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#rustybt-directory-structure]
- Base adapter: `rustybt/live/streaming/base.py` (BaseWebSocketAdapter)
- Binance adapter: `rustybt/live/streaming/binance_stream.py` (BinanceWebSocketAdapter)
- Tick buffer: `rustybt/live/streaming/bar_buffer.py` (BarBuffer)
- Models: `rustybt/live/streaming/models.py` (TickData, StreamConfig)
- Tests: `tests/live/streaming/test_base_adapter.py`, `tests/live/streaming/test_binance_stream.py`
- Documentation: `docs/architecture/live-trading.md` (add WebSocket streaming section)

### Integration Points
- LiveTradingEngine: Uses WebSocket adapters for real-time market data
- DataFeed: Dispatches TickData as MarketDataEvent
- BarBuffer: Converts ticks to OHLCV bars
- BrokerAdapter: May provide WebSocket data (e.g., IB streaming)

### Binance WebSocket Message Format Examples

**Binance Message Format Note:** Examples shown are for spot market. Futures format may differ slightly (additional fields like markPrice, fundingRate). Adapter should handle both.

**Kline (Candlestick):**
```json
{
  "e": "kline",
  "E": 1638747420000,
  "s": "BTCUSDT",
  "k": {
    "t": 1638747360000,
    "T": 1638747419999,
    "s": "BTCUSDT",
    "i": "1m",
    "o": "49500.00",
    "c": "49550.00",
    "h": "49600.00",
    "l": "49480.00",
    "v": "123.456",
    "x": false
  }
}
```

**Trade:**
```json
{
  "e": "trade",
  "E": 1638747420000,
  "s": "BTCUSDT",
  "t": 123456,
  "p": "49500.00",
  "q": "0.5",
  "T": 1638747420000,
  "m": true
}
```

### Bar Buffering Logic
1. Receive tick with timestamp, price, volume
2. Determine bar interval (e.g., 1 minute → round down to minute boundary)
3. Add tick to current bar buffer:
   - If first tick in bar: open = price
   - Update: high = max(high, price), low = min(low, price)
   - If last tick (bar complete): close = price
   - Aggregate: volume += tick_volume
4. On bar boundary: Emit completed bar, start new bar

### Reconnection Strategy
- Initial connect: immediate
- Reconnect on disconnect: exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s max)
- Re-subscribe to all active subscriptions after reconnect
- Log reconnection attempts and successes

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Location:**
- Unit tests: `tests/live/streaming/test_base_adapter.py`, `tests/live/streaming/test_binance_stream.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/live/test_websocket_streaming.py`

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests: ≥90% coverage (mock WebSocket server)
- Integration tests: Use real WebSocket connections (mark with @pytest.mark.websocket_integration)
- Test connection lifecycle, message parsing, buffering, error handling

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Connection succeeds and receives messages
- Auto-reconnect on disconnect
- Subscription management (subscribe → messages → unsubscribe)
- Message parsing with various formats
- Tick-to-bar buffering produces correct OHLCV bars
- Heartbeat maintains connection
- Error handling for disconnect, parse errors, rate limits
- Re-subscription after reconnect

**Test Fixtures:**
- Mock WebSocket server returning sample messages
- Sample Binance kline and trade messages
- Sample tick data for buffering tests
- WebSocket test client

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Score: 80/100 (Good Implementation with Technical Debt)**

This story delivers a solid WebSocket streaming foundation with excellent architecture and comprehensive functionality. The implementation correctly uses async/await patterns, Decimal precision for financial data, immutable dataclasses, and robust error handling with circuit breaker pattern. The developer completed all 10 acceptance criteria with 61 passing tests.

**Strengths:**
- **Architecture Excellence:** Clean abstraction with BaseWebSocketAdapter providing extensible framework
- **Financial Precision:** Proper use of Decimal throughout for price/volume data (no float precision issues)
- **Resilience Design:** Exponential backoff reconnection (1s→16s), circuit breaker (10 error threshold), heartbeat monitoring (60s timeout)
- **Data Integrity:** OHLCVBar validation ensures OHLCV relationships (high ≥ low, etc.) at construction time
- **Production Ready:** Structured logging (structlog), proper error hierarchies, configurable parameters
- **Documentation:** Excellent 350-line WebSocket section in live-trading.md with architecture diagrams, usage examples, and implementation guide

**Weaknesses:**
- **Test Coverage Gap:** 82% coverage is below 90% target. BaseWebSocketAdapter async lifecycle methods (_listen, _heartbeat_monitor, reconnect) have test gaps (67% on base.py)
- **Linting Technical Debt:** 11 issues requiring cleanup before production (shadowing builtins, broad exception handling, contextlib.suppress opportunities)
- **Integration Test Gap:** Documentation references non-existent integration tests (tests/integration/live/test_websocket_streaming.py)

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage: 82% (Below Target)**

| Module | Coverage | Missing |
|--------|----------|---------|
| models.py | 100% | - |
| bar_buffer.py | 92% | Lines 45, 49, 150, 230, 256-258 (edge case handling) |
| **base.py** | **67%** | **Lines 111-112, 138-139, 170-171, 212-216, 292-336, 343-368, 391, 396-398 (async methods)** |
| binance_stream.py | 93% | Lines 87-89, 102, 125-127 (exception paths) |

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Primary Gap:** BaseWebSocketAdapter async lifecycle methods (_listen, _heartbeat_monitor, reconnect) have test coverage gaps
- **Root Cause:** Unit tests use mocks but don't exercise full async state machine edge cases
- **Impact:** Medium risk - untested code paths in connection management could fail in production edge cases (network flakiness, race conditions)
- **Recommendation:** Add integration tests with real WebSocket mock server to achieve 90%+ coverage

**Test Quality: Excellent**
- Proper use of pytest-asyncio for async tests
- Comprehensive edge case coverage (invalid data, error scenarios, boundary conditions)
- Good test organization (TestOHLCVBar, TestBarBuffer, TestBaseWebSocketAdapter, TestBinanceWebSocketAdapter)
- Tests validate OHLCV invariants (high ≥ low, etc.)

### Linting Issues (11 Total)

**Must Fix for Production:**

1. **A001** - Shadowing builtin `ConnectionError` ([base.py:34](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py#L34))
   - Fix: Rename to `WSConnectionError` or `WebSocketConnectionError`

2. **BLE001** - Broad exception catching (4 instances: [base.py:218](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py#L218), [321](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py#L321), [334](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py#L334), [367](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py#L367))
   - Fix: Specify exception types or use Union[WebSocketException, ConnectionClosed] for WebSocket errors

3. **SIM105** - Use contextlib.suppress (2 instances: [base.py:146-149](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py#L146), [153-156](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py#L153))
   - Fix: Replace `try-except-pass` with `contextlib.suppress(asyncio.CancelledError)`

4. **RUF006** - Uncaptured task reference ([base.py:379](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py#L379))
   - Fix: Store reference: `self._reconnect_task = asyncio.create_task(self.reconnect())`

**Low Priority:**

5. **ANN401** - Any type hints (2 instances: [base.py:101](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py#L101), [binance_stream.py:34](rustybt/live/streaming/binance_stream.py#L34))
   - Fix: Use `Callable[[TickData], None]` instead of `Any` for on_tick

6. **E501** - Line too long ([base.py:219](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py#L219), 103 > 100)
   - Fix: Break line

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - No security concerns identified

- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- WebSocket URLs configurable (not hardcoded)
- Proper validation in TickData and OHLCVBar constructors prevents invalid data injection
- Structured logging uses str() for user-controlled data (prevents log injection)
- Credential management deferred to broker integration (correct separation of concerns)

### Performance Considerations

✓ **PASS** - Performance design is sound

**Strengths:**
- Async/await eliminates blocking I/O
- Circuit breaker prevents resource exhaustion during error storms
- Exponential backoff prevents thundering herd on reconnect
- Decimal operations used correctly (no unnecessary conversions)
- BarBuffer uses defaultdict for O(1) symbol lookup

**Minor Optimization Opportunities:**
- Consider connection pooling for multiple symbol streams (future enhancement)
- Bar buffer flush operations could batch callbacks (low priority)

### Non-Functional Requirements

| NFR | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **Reliability** | ✓ PASS | Exponential backoff, circuit breaker, heartbeat monitoring, auto re-subscribe |
| **Maintainability** | ⚠️ CONCERNS | Linting issues reduce code quality. Well-structured but needs cleanup |
| **Performance** | ✓ PASS | Async design, efficient data structures, circuit breaker protection |
| **Security** | ✓ PASS | No hardcoded secrets, proper validation, log injection prevention |
| **Testability** | ⚠️ CONCERNS | 82% coverage below 90% target. Good test design but coverage gaps |
| **Extensibility** | ✓ PASS | BaseWebSocketAdapter provides clean extension point for new exchanges |

### Technical Debt Identified

   - 8% coverage gap to reach 90% target
   - Integration tests referenced in docs but not implemented
   - Estimated effort: 4-6 hours to add integration tests

2. **Linting Debt (Low Priority):**
   - 11 linting violations
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours to fix

3. **Documentation Debt (Low Priority):**
   - Integration test references need update or implementation
   - Estimated effort: 30 minutes

**Total Estimated Debt: 6-9 hours**

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → [docs/qa/gates/6.6-websocket-data-adapter-foundation.yml](../qa/gates/6.6-websocket-data-adapter-foundation.yml)

**Quality Score: 80/100**
- -10 points: Test coverage 8% below target (82% vs 90%)
- -10 points: 11 linting issues requiring cleanup

**Status Reason:** Excellent implementation with solid architecture and comprehensive functionality. Test coverage gap (82% vs 90% target) and linting technical debt prevent PASS gate. Recommend addressing test coverage and linting issues before marking Done, though story delivers all functional requirements.

### Recommended Status

⚠️ **Changes Recommended** - Address before marking Done:

**Must Fix:**
1. Improve test coverage to 90%+ (add integration tests for async lifecycle methods)
2. Fix linting issues (rename ConnectionError, specify exception types, use contextlib.suppress)
3. Update documentation or create integration tests (resolve docs/code mismatch)

**Story owner decides final status** - All functional requirements met, but quality standards need attention.

---

**Review Methodology:** Comprehensive analysis including requirements traceability (10/10 ACs mapped), code architecture review, test coverage analysis (pytest-cov), linting validation (ruff), NFR assessment (security, performance, reliability, maintainability), and technical debt quantification.

- **Documentation:** Comprehensive 350-line WebSocket section with architecture diagrams

**Remaining Gap:**
- **Test Coverage:** 83% coverage (7 percentage points below 90% target)
  - BaseWebSocketAdapter async lifecycle methods still have test gaps
  - Missing coverage in `_listen()`, `_heartbeat_monitor()`, edge cases in `reconnect()`
  - Impact: Low-Medium risk - untested async state machine paths could fail in production edge cases

### Refactoring Performed

**This Re-Review Session:**
No refactoring performed - developer successfully completed all required fixes independently.

**Previous QA Fix Session (Applied by Dev):**
- **File**: [rustybt/live/streaming/base.py](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py)
  - **Change**: Renamed `ConnectionError` → `WSConnectionError` (line 35)
  - **Why**: Shadowing builtin `ConnectionError` reduces code clarity
  - **How**: Import-safe rename preserves functionality while avoiding builtin shadowing

- **File**: [rustybt/live/streaming/base.py](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py)
  - **Change**: Used `contextlib.suppress()` for task cancellation (lines 145-151)
  - **Why**: Pythonic pattern for expected exceptions, cleaner than try-except-pass
  - **How**: `with suppress(asyncio.CancelledError): await task` replaces bare except

- **File**: [rustybt/live/streaming/base.py](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py)
  - **Change**: Specified exception types (lines 213, 318, 327, 360)
  - **Why**: Broad `except Exception` can mask unexpected errors
  - **How**: Changed to `(WebSocketException, OSError)` and `(ValueError, KeyError, TypeError)` for precise handling

- **File**: [rustybt/live/streaming/base.py](rustybt/live/streaming/base.py)
  - **Change**: Stored reconnect task reference (line 372)
  - **Why**: Prevents task garbage collection before completion
  - **How**: `self._reconnect_task = asyncio.create_task(self.reconnect())`

- **File**: [rustybt/live/streaming/binance_stream.py](rustybt/live/streaming/binance_stream.py)
  - **Change**: Fixed type hints `Any` → `Callable[[TickData], None]` (line 35)
  - **Why**: Precise type hints enable better static analysis and IDE support
  - **How**: Imported `Callable` from `collections.abc`, specified callback signature

- **File**: [docs/architecture/live-trading.md](docs/architecture/live-trading.md)
  - **Change**: Removed references to non-existent `tests/integration/live/test_websocket_streaming.py`
  - **Why**: Documentation-code mismatch confuses developers
  - **How**: Updated test section to reflect actual test structure in `tests/live/streaming/`

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage: 83% (Below Target by 7 points)**

| Module | Coverage | Change | Missing |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| models.py | 100% | - | - |
| bar_buffer.py | 92% | - | Lines 45, 49, 150, 230, 256-258 (edge cases) |
| **base.py** | **68%** | **+1%** | **Lines 110-111, 137-138, 165-166, 208, 214-218, 289-290, 294-329, 336-361, 384, 389-391** |
| binance_stream.py | 93% | - | Lines 88-90, 103, 126-128 (exception paths) |

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Primary Gap:** BaseWebSocketAdapter async methods (_listen, _heartbeat_monitor, reconnect edge cases)
- **Root Cause:** Unit tests with mocks don't exercise full async state machine including race conditions
- **Risk Assessment:** **Medium** - untested async paths could fail with network flakiness, connection race conditions
- **Effort to Fix:** ~4-6 hours to add comprehensive async integration tests

**Test Quality: Excellent** (unchanged)
- 61 tests all passing with proper async testing using pytest-asyncio
- Comprehensive edge case coverage (invalid data, errors, boundary conditions)
- Good test organization with clear test class structure

### Security Review

✅ **PASS** - No security concerns (unchanged from previous review)

- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- WebSocket URLs configurable
- Proper validation in constructors prevents invalid data
- Structured logging prevents log injection
- Credential management properly deferred to broker integration

### Performance Considerations

✅ **PASS** - Performance design remains sound (unchanged)

**Strengths:**
- Async/await eliminates blocking I/O
- Circuit breaker prevents resource exhaustion
- Exponential backoff prevents thundering herd
- Efficient data structures (defaultdict for O(1) symbol lookup)

### Non-Functional Requirements

| NFR | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **Reliability** | ✅ PASS | Exponential backoff, circuit breaker, heartbeat monitoring, auto re-subscribe |
| **Maintainability** | ✅ PASS | **IMPROVED** - All linting issues resolved, production-ready code quality |
| **Performance** | ✅ PASS | Async design, efficient data structures, circuit breaker protection |
| **Security** | ✅ PASS | No hardcoded secrets, proper validation, log injection prevention |
| **Testability** | ⚠️ CONCERNS | 83% coverage (7 points below 90% target, but test design is sound) |
| **Extensibility** | ✅ PASS | BaseWebSocketAdapter provides clean extension point |

### Technical Debt Summary

**Resolved Since Last Review:**
- ✅ **Linting Debt** - All 11 violations fixed (estimated 2 hours, completed)
- ✅ **Documentation Debt** - Integration test references corrected (estimated 30 min, completed)

**Remaining Debt:**

1. **Test Coverage Debt (Medium Priority):**
   - 7 percentage points below 90% target (83% current)
   - Async lifecycle methods need integration test coverage
   - **Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours to add comprehensive async tests
   - **Risk:** Medium - could miss edge cases in production (network failures, race conditions)

**Total Outstanding Debt: 4-6 hours** (reduced from 6-9 hours)
