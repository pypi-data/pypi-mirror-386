## Course Change Context - Why This Epic Exists

### The Problem Discovery

**Timeline of Events**:

1. **Epic 10 Initial Completion** (Oct 2024)
   - Stories 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 marked "Complete"
   - Documentation covered 90%+ of framework APIs
   - Appeared to meet acceptance criteria

2. **First Quality Issue** (Oct 14, 2025)
   - User reported fabricated order types (TWAP, VWAP, Iceberg)
   - Story 10.X1 remediation removed 157 fabricated/incorrect API references
   - Achieved 100% API import verification
   - **STATUS**: Symptom fixed, disease remained

3. **Systemic Quality Issues Discovered** (Oct 15, 2025)
   - User reported: "Documentation full of incorrect framework API usage, nonfunctional code examples, fake references"
   - **Root cause identified**: Documentation created by syntax inference, not framework expertise
   - Story 10.X1 only verified APIs can be **imported**, not that they're **used correctly**
   - **Decision**: Complete Epic 10 redo required with comprehensive quality framework

### Why Redo Instead of Incremental Fixes?

**Systemic Issues Require Systematic Solutions**:

1. **Incorrect API Usage Patterns**
   - APIs exist and can be imported ✅
   - But usage patterns in examples are wrong ❌
   - Examples won't run despite correct syntax ❌
   - Demonstrates lack of framework expertise ❌

2. **Inadequate Validation Process**
   - Previous validation: "Can I import this API?" ✅
   - Required validation: "Does this example actually work?" ❌
   - Missing: Framework expert review ❌
   - Missing: Automated example execution testing ❌

3. **Documentation Creation Process Flawed**
   - Created by inferring syntax, not using framework ❌
   - No requirement for framework expertise ❌
   - No executable example testing ❌
   - Quality standards insufficient ❌

4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
   - **Incremental fixes**: 40-60 hours, perpetual quality debt, inconsistent quality
   - **Complete redo**: 92-148 hours, production-grade quality, reusable framework, user trust
   - **Decision**: Redo is more cost-effective long-term

### What Story 10.X1 Fixed (And What It Didn't)

**Story 10.X1 Achievements** ✅:
- Fixed 157 fabricated/incorrect API references
- Removed 3 completely fabricated order types
- Achieved 100% API import verification (210 APIs)
- Created automated verification script

**Story 10.X1 Limitations** ❌:
- Only verified APIs can be **imported**, not **used correctly**
- Did NOT test if examples actually **run and produce correct results**
- Did NOT validate **framework usage patterns and workflows**
- Did NOT ensure **production-grade quality standards**
- Did NOT address **scattered documentation organization**

### The Course Correction

**Epic 11 Approach**:

1. **Prevention**: Create comprehensive quality framework FIRST
2. **Organization**: Reorganize docs (internal vs external)
3. **Standards**: Establish strict quality requirements
4. **Automation**: Build example execution testing
5. **Expertise**: Require framework expert review
6. **Validation**: Multi-level validation at every step
7. **Redo**: Recreate Epic 10 documentation with maximum care

**Principle**: "Do it right the second time, not the third time."

**Owner**: Dev Agent (with Framework Expert consultation)
**Prerequisites**: Stories 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5 MUST ALL be complete
**Status**: 🚨 CRITICAL - Discovered Post-Epic 11 Completion

**Why This Story Exists (Critical Gap Discovery)**:
- Epic 11 focused ONLY on API Reference Documentation (Stories 11.2-11.4)
- User-facing docs (Home, Quick Start, Getting Started, Guides, Examples) were NEVER validated
- **CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'order_target' from 'rustybt.api'`
- Root Cause: `rustybt/api.py` does NOT export core trading functions to users
- Impact: Quick Start tutorial fails immediately for ALL new users
- Gap: 33+ user-facing documents never validated with Epic 11 standards

**What This Story Accomplishes**:
- Fixes critical API export bug blocking new user onboarding
- Validates ALL user-facing documentation (Home, Quick Start, Getting Started)
- Tests ALL 20+ user guides with Epic 11 quality standards
- Executes ALL 13 Jupyter notebooks + 20+ Python examples
- Applies same rigorous quality framework to user documentation
- Ensures new users can successfully complete Quick Start tutorial

**Scope - 5 Critical Sections**:
1. **Home Page** (`docs/index.md`) - First user touchpoint
2. **Quick Start** (`docs/getting-started/quickstart.md`) - Critical user journey
3. **Getting Started** (installation.md, configuration.md) - Onboarding docs
4. **User Guides** (20+ guides in `/docs/guides/`) - Feature documentation
5. **Examples & Tutorials** (13 notebooks + 20+ Python examples) - Learning materials

**Key Deliverables**:
1. API export bug fix in `rustybt/api.py`
2. Corrected Home page with working import examples
3. Validated Quick Start tutorial (tested end-to-end)
4. Tested Getting Started (installation + configuration)

7. Tested all 20+ Python examples (100% pass)
8. Automated test suite for user documentation
9. Expert review and approval
10. Story completion report with metrics

**Quality Requirements** (Epic 11 Standards):
- Phase 0: Fix API export bug FIRST (blocker for all other work)
- Pre-flight checklist 100% complete before validation
- All code examples executable (tested with automated harness)
- All import statements verified to work
- All CLI commands tested
- Validation checklist 100% complete with evidence
- Framework expert written approval
- Zero known issues at story completion

**Critical First Phase - API Export Bug Fix**:
- **Task 0.1**: Analyze `rustybt/api.py` and identify missing exports
- **Task 0.2**: Design fix (add exports vs update docs vs both)
- **Task 0.3**: Implement fix and verify backward compatibility
- **Task 0.4**: Test all documented import patterns
- **BLOCKER**: Cannot proceed to documentation validation until fixed

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. API export bug fixed - all documented imports work
2. Home page validated - all code snippets execute
3. Quick Start validated - completes successfully from scratch
4. Getting Started validated - installation + configuration tested

8. Automated tests created - CI/CD integration
9. Expert approval obtained - 95+ quality score
10. Documentation consistency - no conflicting patterns
11. mkdocs integration - site builds successfully
12. Zero regressions - existing functionality verified

**Course Change Instructions**:
- This is an EXTENSION to Epic 11, not a replacement
- Epic 11 (Stories 11.1-11.5) addressed API Reference docs only
- This story addresses the critical gap in user-facing docs
- Same rigorous Epic 11 standards apply
- User onboarding depends on this story's success
- Fix API export bug BEFORE any documentation work

**Special Attention**:
- 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG**: Quick Start fails with ImportError
- 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE**: `rustybt/api.py` missing core function exports
- 🚨 **USER IMPACT**: Every new user encounters this bug
- 🚨 **PRIORITY**: Fix API bug first, then validate docs
- ⚠️ **SCOPE**: 33+ files to validate (Home + Quick Start + Guides + Examples)
- ⚠️ **TESTING**: All examples must execute, not just import check

---

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (documentation-only epic)
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing documentation build process
- ✅ mkdocs configuration enhanced but backward compatible
- ✅ Performance impact: None (documentation files only)
- ✅ Automated scripts can be integrated into CI/CD
- ✅ Quality framework is additive, not disruptive

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risk: High Time Investment May Not Deliver Value

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: HIGH (92-148 hours is significant)

**Mitigation**:
- Phased approach allows early validation and course correction
- Quality framework is reusable for all future documentation
- Production-grade docs reduce long-term support burden
- User trust has significant business value
- Incremental fixes would cost more long-term (40-60 hours initially, ongoing quality debt)

**Rollback Plan**: Restore archived docs if redo fails; keep quality framework

---

### Secondary Risk: Framework Expert Availability Limited

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: HIGH (can't validate without expert)

**Mitigation**:
- Schedule expert review sessions in advance
- Batch expert reviews for efficiency (e.g., review full story at once)
- Create expert review process documentation
- Document questions during creation, resolve in batch reviews
- Consider training additional experts if availability becomes blocker

**Contingency**: If expert unavailable, can use framework maintainer code review approach

---

### Tertiary Risk: Discovery of Framework Issues During Documentation

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: MEDIUM (could delay timeline)

**Mitigation**:
- Document framework issues as separate backlog items
- Don't block documentation on framework fixes
- Document workarounds where necessary
- Clearly mark limitations in documentation
- Create GitHub issues for discovered problems

**Benefit**: Documentation process improves framework quality through discovery

---

### Risk: Temptation to Reuse Low-Quality Existing Content

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: HIGH (defeats purpose of redo)

**Mitigation**:
- Strict adherence to quality standards (no exceptions)
- All content must pass validation checklist
- Expert review catches preserved low-quality content
- Archive available for reference only, not copying
- Pre-flight checklist includes commitment to production quality

**Enforcement**: QA Agent rejects stories that bypass quality framework

## Course Change Instructions for Implementers

### Critical Context - Read This First

**You are implementing a COMPLETE REDO of Epic 10 due to systemic quality issues.**

**What Happened**:
1. Epic 10 initially completed with apparent 90%+ API coverage
2. User discovered fabricated APIs (Story 10.X1 removed 157 issues)
3. User then discovered systemic quality issues: incorrect usage, non-functional examples
4. Root cause: Documentation created by syntax inference, not framework expertise
5. Decision: Complete redo with comprehensive quality framework

**Why Redo Instead of Fix**:
- Systemic issues require systematic solution
- Incremental fixes perpetuate quality debt
- Complete redo with quality framework is more cost-effective long-term
- User trust requires production-grade quality

### Mandatory Reading Before Starting

**Read these documents IN ORDER**:

1. **This Epic Document** (you're reading it now)
   - Understand the full scope and course change context

2. **Sprint Change Proposal** (`docs/qa/SPRINT_CHANGE_PROPOSAL_EPIC10_COMPLETE_REDO.md`)
   - Detailed analysis of why redo is necessary
   - Complete implementation roadmap
   - Risk mitigation strategies

3. **Previous Remediation Summary** (`docs/qa/EPIC10_REMEDIATION_SUMMARY.md`)
   - What Story 10.X1 fixed (import verification)
   - What Story 10.X1 didn't fix (usage validation)
   - Lessons learned from first remediation

4. **Archived Epic 10 Documentation** (`docs/_archive/v1-epic10-2025-10-15/`)
   - Reference for structure (NOT for content copying)
   - Learn what NOT to do
   - Identify issues to avoid repeating

### Quality Framework is Mandatory

**Story 11.1 MUST BE COMPLETE before starting Stories 11.2, 11.3, 11.4**

**No exceptions. No shortcuts. No "we'll add quality later."**

**Quality Framework Components**:
1. `DOCUMENTATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` - Your bible for quality
2. `DOCUMENTATION_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete before starting each story
3. `DOCUMENTATION_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete before marking story done
4. `scripts/verify_documented_apis.py` - Automated verification (100% pass required)
5. `scripts/run_documented_examples.py` - Automated testing (100% pass required)

**Framework Expert Review is MANDATORY, not optional**

### Story Execution Process (11.2, 11.3, 11.4)

**Step 1: Pre-Flight Checklist**
- Complete `DOCUMENTATION_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md`
- Verify framework knowledge
- Analyze source code
- Prepare testing environment
- NO documentation writing until checklist complete

**Step 2: Documentation Creation**
- Use framework in production scenarios
- Test examples BEFORE documenting
- Reference source code constantly
- Follow quality standards religiously
- No syntax inference - only document what you've used

**Step 3: Continuous Validation**
- Run `verify_documented_apis.py` frequently
- Run `run_documented_examples.py` after each example
- Fix issues immediately
- Don't accumulate quality debt

**Step 4: Pre-Submission Validation**
- Complete `DOCUMENTATION_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`
- 100% checklist completion required
- Run all automated tests
- Review all examples manually
- Fix all issues before requesting expert review

**Step 5: Expert Review**
- Submit story for framework expert review
- Address all expert feedback
- Obtain written approval
- NO story complete without expert sign-off

**Step 6: Story Completion**
- Mark story complete only after all gates passed
- Document completion evidence
- Archive checklist and review records
- Move to next story

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**❌ DON'T: Copy from archived documentation without validation**
- Archived docs have quality issues - that's why we're redoing
- Use archive for structure reference only
- All content must be created fresh

**❌ DON'T: Document APIs without testing them first**
- Story 10.2 documented fabricated order types because this wasn't followed
- Test in actual framework before documenting
- If you can't test it, don't document it

**❌ DON'T: Infer syntax without checking source code**
- Original Epic 10 failure was syntax inference
- Check source code for every API
- Verify import paths, parameter names, return types

**❌ DON'T: Skip quality framework steps for efficiency**
- "We'll test it later" leads to quality debt
- Checklists exist to prevent mistakes
- Shortcuts defeat the purpose of the redo

**❌ DON'T: Mark story complete without expert approval**
- Expert review is mandatory gate
- No story complete without written sign-off
- Push back if pressured to skip this

**✅ DO: Test every single example before documenting**
**✅ DO: Use framework in production scenarios to understand patterns**
**✅ DO: Check source code constantly**
**✅ DO: Complete all checklists 100%**
**✅ DO: Get expert review before marking complete**
**✅ DO: Take the time to do it right**

### Success Mindset

**We're not just fixing Epic 10 - we're establishing a quality culture for documentation.**

This epic creates:
- Production-grade documentation users can trust
- Reusable quality framework for future docs
- Automated testing infrastructure
- Expert review process
- Standards that ensure lasting quality

**The time investment (92-148 hours) is worth it because**:
- Incremental fixes would cost more long-term
- User trust has significant value

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **None** - Epic is self-contained documentation work

### Internal Dependencies

**Prerequisites**:
- Story 11.1 MUST complete before 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
- Each story depends on quality framework from 11.1

**Related Work**:
- Epic 10 (superseded by this epic)
- Story 10.X1 (provides baseline verification infrastructure)
- Sprint Change Proposal (provides analysis and rationale)

**Blocking/Blocked**:
- **Blocks**: No other epics blocked
- **Blocked By**: None
- **Optional**: Framework improvements discovered during documentation (backlog items)

---

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers

**Roll back Epic 11 if**:
1. Time investment exceeds 150% of high estimate (>222 hours)
2. Framework expert availability becomes permanent blocker
3. Major framework design issues require code changes before documenting
4. User decides cost-benefit doesn't justify redo after Phase 1 or 2

### Rollback Procedure

**If Epic 11 Fails**:

1. **Restore Archived Documentation**
   - Copy `docs/_archive/v1-epic10-2025-10-15/*` back to `docs/`
   - Revert mkdocs.yml to pre-Epic 11 state
   - Verify documentation builds

2. **Preserve Quality Framework**
   - Keep `docs/internal/DOCUMENTATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`
   - Keep `docs/internal/DOCUMENTATION_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Keep `docs/internal/DOCUMENTATION_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Keep enhanced automation scripts
   - Quality framework still valuable for future work

3. **Fallback to Option 3** (Hybrid Approach):
   - Use quality framework for incremental improvements
   - Fix highest-priority issues first
   - Apply new standards to new documentation
   - Accept longer timeline for quality improvement

4. **Document Lessons Learned**
   - What worked, what didn't
   - Why rollback was necessary
   - Recommendations for alternative approach

### Partial Rollback

**If Individual Stories Fail**:
- Can roll back individual story work
- Keep completed stories
- Adjust timeline and scope
- Quality framework remains valuable

### No Rollback Scenario

**If Epic 11 Succeeds** (expected outcome):
- Archived docs remain for reference
- Quality framework becomes standard
- Production-grade documentation delivered
- User trust restored
