# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness**: 95%

**MVP Scope Appropriateness**: Just Right - MVP clearly defined as Epics 1-5, with Epics 6-9 as production deployment phase

**Readiness for Architecture Phase**: Ready - PRD is comprehensive, well-structured, with clear MVP scope and technical guidance

**Most Critical Strengths**:
1. ✅ MVP vs. Full Vision clearly separated (Epics 1-5 vs. 6-9)
2. ✅ Out-of-scope features explicitly documented
3. ✅ Rust optimization strategy clarified (profile-driven, not limited to Decimal)
4. ✅ Testing/docs distributed across all epics (not isolated)
5. ✅ Epic 9 marked as lowest priority with conditional evaluation

## Category Analysis Table

| Category                         | Status | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS   | None - Goals and Background clearly articulate problem |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS   | MVP = Epics 1-5, Out-of-MVP = Epics 6-9, Out-of-scope documented |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | N/A    | Intentionally skipped (Python library, no UI) |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS   | 18 FRs comprehensive, testable, refined |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS   | 12 NFRs with performance targets subject to profiling |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS   | 9 epics well-structured, stories appropriately sized, ACs testable |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS   | Comprehensive technical assumptions, Rust strategy clarified |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PASS   | Data, integrations, operations covered across epics |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS   | Clear language, structured, comprehensive |

## Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design with:
- Clear MVP scope (Epics 1-5)
- Well-defined requirements and acceptance criteria
- Comprehensive technical guidance
- Distributed testing/documentation approach
- Clarified Rust optimization strategy (profile-driven, any bottleneck)
- Contingency plans for performance targets

**Architect should begin with Epic 1 (Foundation) design, treating Epics 1-5 as validated MVP scope.**
