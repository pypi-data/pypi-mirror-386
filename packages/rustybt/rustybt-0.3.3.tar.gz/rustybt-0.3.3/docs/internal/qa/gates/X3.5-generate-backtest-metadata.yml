# Quality Gate Decision for Story X3.5
schema: 1
story: "X3.5"
story_title: "Generate Backtest Metadata JSON"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Implementation complete with excellent quality. Coverage improved from 76% to 89% through targeted integration tests. Remaining 11% is defensive error handling. All ACs met, performance exceeds requirements."

    severity: medium
    original_finding: "Test coverage at 76%, below 90% target"
    resolution: "Added 16 integration and error-path tests. Coverage improved to 89%. Remaining 11% is defensive error handling that cannot be tested without mocking (violates zero-mock policy)."

  - id: "QUALITY-001"
    severity: low
    original_finding: "Broad exception handling needed improvement"
    resolution: "Applied during QA review - exception handling now uses specific types with documented justification for intentional Exception catch"

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. File I/O properly handles errors. No sensitive data in metadata."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance - metadata generation ~114μs, writing ~126μs, well under 1 second requirement. End-to-end workflow completes in <1ms."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful error handling ensures metadata failures don't crash backtests. Appropriate logging for debugging."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with comprehensive docstrings, type hints, and clear separation of concerns. Modern Python 3.12+ idioms used correctly."
