gate: PASS
status_reason: "2025-10-11: Revalidated via pytest tests/rust -q (51 pass / 8 skip). Rust wrappers, fallbacks, and documentation remain aligned with benchmarks; Polars-first integration continues to be the optimal design. AC1–AC8 satisfied here; AC9/AC10 owned by Story 7.4."

  - summary: "✅ FIXED: Decimal scientific notation edge cases now handled via automatic fallback"
    resolution: "Added try/except fallback in all Rust Decimal functions. When rust-decimal cannot parse extreme values (e.g., 2.2250738585072014E-308), gracefully falls back to Python Decimal path."

  - summary: "✅ FIXED: Mixed float/Decimal sequences now work correctly in fallback paths"
    resolution: "Normalized all values to Decimal in fallback paths to prevent TypeError when mixing float and Decimal."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Numerical operations with proper precision handling and error boundaries."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Benchmarks confirm real speedups (1.4-1.7×) for complex operations on large datasets. Documentation honestly explains conversion overhead principle and when NOT to use Rust (simple operations, small datasets)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 51 Rust-focused tests continue to pass; Decimal fallbacks cover extreme values without regressions."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive documentation, clear API design, automatic fallback mechanism, and well-structured test suite. Good separation of concerns."

architectural_decisions:
  - decision: "Remove DataPortal Rust integration"
    rationale: "Benchmarks showed 12-25× regression. Polars is already Rust-backed and optimal for DataFrame operations. Adding another Rust layer just adds overhead."
    outcome: "Correct decision - uses pure Polars (best performance)"
    refs:
      - "docs/performance/rust-benchmarks.md"
      - "rustybt/data/polars/data_portal.py"

  - decision: "Defer AC9/AC10 to Story 7.4"
    rationale: "Epic design separates implementation (7.3) from validation (7.4). Story 7.4 explicitly handles profiling comparison and performance target validation as dedicated validation phase."
    outcome: "Appropriate per epic workflow"

performance_analysis:
  speedups_achieved:
    - operation: "SMA (large dataset 10k elements)"
      speedup: "1.47×"
      python_time_ms: 0.8496
      rust_time_ms: 0.5781

      speedup: "1.15×"
      python_time_ms: 0.6753
      rust_time_ms: 0.5866

  regressions_explained:
    - operation: "Simple operations (sum, mean, index_select)"
      observed: "0.04-0.08× (12-25× SLOWER)"
      explanation: "Python↔Rust conversion overhead (Vec allocation + 2 full copies) >> computation cost for simple operations. Python builtins are C-optimized and faster when conversion overhead is considered."
      mitigation: "Documentation advises against using Rust for simple operations. Use Python builtins instead."

    - operation: "Small datasets (<1000 elements)"
      observed: "Minimal or no speedup"
      explanation: "Conversion overhead dominates for small datasets"
      mitigation: "Documentation specifies Rust is beneficial for 10,000+ element datasets with complex operations"
