# Quality Gate Decision - Story X3.3
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "X3.3"
story_title: "Implement Strategy Code Capture via Import Analysis"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Excellent implementation with comprehensive AST-based import analysis, full AC compliance, strong test coverage (85%), and exemplary code quality. Minor coverage gap acceptable as uncovered lines are defensive error paths."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Calculation: 100 - (0 FAIL issues × 20) - (1 minor concern × 5)
# Minor concern: Test coverage 85% vs 90% target (-5 points)

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Uses AST static analysis only, never imports/executes user code. Path validation prevents traversal attacks. No arbitrary code execution risks."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code capture completes in <0.01s for multi-file projects, well under 5s requirement (IV3). AST parsing efficient, module spec caching implemented."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation. Warnings instead of failures. Recursive analysis with cycle detection. Never fails backtest."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code structure with clear separation of concerns. 100% type hints, comprehensive docstrings, complies with all coding standards."

  # No immediate actions required - implementation is production-ready

  future:
    - action: "Add tests for rare error paths to achieve 90%+ coverage"
      refs: ["tests/backtest/test_code_capture.py"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Most uncovered lines are defensive error handling paths difficult to trigger. Core functionality has excellent coverage."

    - action: "Consider parallel file copying for very large projects (>100 files)"
      refs: ["rustybt/backtest/code_capture.py:copy_strategy_files"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current performance excellent (<0.01s for typical projects). Optimization only needed if large-scale usage patterns emerge."

    - action: "Add optional configuration to exclude file patterns (e.g., *.pyc, __pycache__)"
      refs: ["rustybt/backtest/code_capture.py:analyze_imports"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Enhancement for user convenience. Current implementation handles all Python files correctly."
