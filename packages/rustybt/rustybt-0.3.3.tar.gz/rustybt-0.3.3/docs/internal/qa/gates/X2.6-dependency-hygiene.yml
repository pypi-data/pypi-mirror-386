story: "X2.6"
story_title: "P1 Dependency Hygiene"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent dependency management implementation with 48% reduction in production dependencies (269→138 packages), 0 production vulnerabilities, and comprehensive security infrastructure. However, 2 LGPL dependencies present despite Apache 2.0/MIT-only policy require tracking and future remediation."

technical_debt:
  introduced: "2 LGPL dependencies (frozendict, chardet) violate Apache 2.0/MIT-only policy"
  addressed: "Reduced production dependencies by 48% (269→138 packages), improved security posture"

strengths:
  - "Excellent dependency split implementation with clear production/dev separation"
  - "48% reduction in production dependencies (269→138 packages)"

  - "License compliance script with CI integration"
  - "Clear vulnerability remediation policy with SLA definitions"

decision_factors:
  - "All 7 acceptance criteria implemented and verified"
  - "Production dependencies are clean (0 vulnerabilities)"
  - "Significant reduction in dependency count improves security"
  - "LGPL dependencies properly documented with justification and mitigation plans"
  - "LGPL allows dynamic linking without GPL contamination (legal compliance maintained)"
  - "Comprehensive CI/CD integration for ongoing security monitoring"
  - "Development velocity maintained - all tests passing"
  - "Non-blocking licensing concerns tracked for future remediation"
  - "Implementation quality exceeds baseline requirements"
