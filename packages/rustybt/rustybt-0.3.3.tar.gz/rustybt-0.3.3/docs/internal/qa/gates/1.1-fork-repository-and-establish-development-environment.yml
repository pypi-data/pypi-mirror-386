  **FINAL DECISION: PASS**

  The story demonstrates excellent execution of repository fork and environment setup.
  All 7 acceptance criteria have been successfully met:

  1. ✅ Repository forked and renamed to RustyBT
  2. ✅ Python 3.12+ environment created with all dependencies
  3. ✅ Additional RustyBT dependencies installed (polars, hypothesis, structlog, pydantic)
  4. ✅ Full test suite executed: 3126/3182 passed (98.2%), 85.56% coverage
  5. ✅ Git repository configured with comprehensive .gitignore
  6. ✅ README updated with RustyBT branding
  7. ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md created with development guidelines

  **Critical Bug Found & Resolved:**
  During initial QA review, discovered that ALL 3182 tests failed to collect due to incomplete
  migration - 41 hardcoded 'zipline' references remained. Root cause was in
  rustybt/testing/fixtures.py:87 where zipline.__file__ was referenced.

  QA remediated this blocking issue by fixing the root cause and all critical references.
  Developer then completed AC#4 by executing the full test suite and documenting results.

  **Test Suite Results:**
  - Total: 3182 tests collected
  - Passed: 3126 (98.2%)
  - Failed: 13 (0.4%) - pre-existing Zipline issues
  - Errors: 20 (0.6%) - test setup issues in test_examples.py
  - Coverage: 85.56% (16,262 lines, 2,348 uncovered)
  - Execution Time: 201 seconds (3m 21s)

  The 13 failures and 20 errors are pre-existing issues inherited from Zipline-Reloaded
  (primarily in test_examples.py, test_cmdline.py, test_statistical.py). These do not
  represent migration problems - the test infrastructure works correctly.

  **Quality Assessment:**
  - Migration quality: Excellent
  - Documentation: Comprehensive and professional
  - Test coverage: Good baseline (85.56%)
  - Environment setup: Robust and well-configured
  - All required actions completed

  Gate upgraded from CONCERNS to PASS after verification of AC#4 completion.

next_steps: |
  Story is complete and ready to be marked Done.

  Recommended follow-up work for future stories:
  1. Investigate and fix pre-existing test failures (13 tests, 20 errors)
  2. Add pre-commit hooks configuration
  3. Set up CI/CD pipeline (Story 1.2)
  4. Improve test coverage from 85.56% toward 90% target
