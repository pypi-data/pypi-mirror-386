  • Cross-platform CI validation: 6/6 matrix combinations passing
  • Complete documentation with accurate technical references
  • Zero technical debt, zero clippy warnings, 100% requirements coverage

  Previous Concerns Resolution:
  All issues from prior reviews (packaging path, documentation accuracy) fully resolved.

  Production Readiness: HIGH
  Implementation represents a model example of Rust/Python FFI integration suitable for
  reference by other projects.

# Risk Assessment
final_risk_profile:
  overall_risk: LOW
  risk_areas:
    security: LOW  # Build-time only, no runtime exposure
    performance: LOW  # Establishes optimization foundation
    reliability: LOW  # Comprehensive testing, graceful fallbacks
    maintainability: LOW  # Excellent documentation, clear patterns
    compatibility: LOW  # Stable ABI, cross-platform validated

  future_monitoring:
    - "Monitor CI build times as Rust codebase grows (current: <10s)"
    - "Track PyO3 releases for future compatibility updates"
    - "Validate Rust extension loading on new Python point releases"

# Sign-off
recommendation:
  status: "APPROVE for Done"
