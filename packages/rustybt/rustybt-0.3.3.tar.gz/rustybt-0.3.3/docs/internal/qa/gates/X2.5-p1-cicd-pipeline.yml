story: "X2.5"
story_title: "P1 CI/CD Pipeline"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Re-review: TEST-001 successfully resolved with excellent implementation. However, CQ-001 and SEC-001 fixes incomplete - developer removed continue-on-error but forgot to add checks to failure conditions (logic error). 2 of 3 concerns remain unresolved. Simple fixes required (<15 min)."

  - id: "CQ-001-V2"
    severity: medium
    status: UNRESOLVED
    finding: "Mypy failure check logic error - step no longer has continue-on-error but workflow summary excludes mypy from failure condition (.github/workflows/code-quality.yml:96-98)"
    suggested_action: "Add [[ \"${{ steps.mypy.outcome }}\" == \"failure\" ]] || to failure condition AND remove '(non-blocking)' label from line 92"
    suggested_owner: dev
    refs: [".github/workflows/code-quality.yml:96-98", ".github/workflows/code-quality.yml:92"]
    notes: "Developer attempted fix by removing continue-on-error but missed updating failure logic. Still effectively non-blocking despite AC 1 requirement."

    notes: "Identical logic error to CQ-001-V2. Developer removed continue-on-error but forgot to update failure condition."

decision_factors:
  - "10 of 11 acceptance criteria fully implemented"
  - "AC 7 (branch protection) requires manual GitHub UI configuration"
  - "TEST-001 successfully resolved - demonstrates developer competency"
  - "2 concerns remain (CQ-001-V2, SEC-001-V2) - simple logic errors, <15 min to fix"
  - "All workflow YAML files syntactically valid"
  - "All required scripts present and functional"
