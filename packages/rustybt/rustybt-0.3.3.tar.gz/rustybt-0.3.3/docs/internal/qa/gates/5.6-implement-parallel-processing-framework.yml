  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Worker isolation through multiprocessing provides good security boundaries."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Performance benchmarks validate parallel speedup. Tests acknowledge Python multiprocessing overhead which is realistic."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent error handling with worker failure recovery, timeout management, and graceful degradation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture with excellent docstrings, type hints, and separation of concerns. Zero-mock compliant."
