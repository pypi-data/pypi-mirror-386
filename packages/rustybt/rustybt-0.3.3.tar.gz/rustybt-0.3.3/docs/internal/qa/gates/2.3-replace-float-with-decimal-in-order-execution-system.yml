# Quality Gate Decision: Story 2.3
# Replace Float with Decimal in Order Execution System

schema: 1
story: "2.3"
story_title: "Replace Float with Decimal in Order Execution System"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 10 acceptance criteria fully met with comprehensive test coverage. Property-based tests prove precision invariants with 1000+ examples. Advanced order type tests validate Decimal precision for StopLimit, TrailingStop, and Bracket orders. Integration tests confirm blotter-ledger workflow maintains exact precision. Code quality is excellent with 100% type hints, comprehensive docstrings, and zero-mock enforcement. Ready for production use."

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All monetary values use Decimal. Input validation prevents negative commissions/slippage. Immutable DecimalTransaction prevents audit trail tampering."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Decimal arithmetic is 10-100x slower than float (expected tradeoff). Performance optimization deferred to Story 2.7."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Property-based tests with 1000+ examples prove precision invariants hold."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "100% type hint coverage. Comprehensive docstrings. Enhanced commission.py comments improve understanding."
