    - "Template Method: BaseCircuitBreaker provides common functionality"
    - "Strategy Pattern: Different breaker types with unified interface"
    - "Observer Pattern: Event callbacks for circuit breaker trips"
    - "Manager Pattern: CircuitBreakerManager coordinates multiple breakers"

  strengths:

    - "Some redundant f-string usage (no placeholders)"
    - "typing.Any used in callback signatures (acceptable for event system)"

  complexity: "Well-controlled - no functions exceed reasonable complexity limits"
