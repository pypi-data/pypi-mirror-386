story: "8.9"
story_title: "Enforce Type Safety with mypy --strict"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Type safety enhances security by preventing type confusion bugs. Pre-commit hooks enforce type checking before commit."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Type hints have minimal runtime overhead. Mypy adds ~5-10s to CI/CD which is acceptable for the safety benefits."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Type checking catches bugs at development time rather than runtime. CI/CD integration prevents type errors from reaching production."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive documentation created. Gradual typing strategy properly tracked. PEP 561 marker enables downstream type checking."

    - action: "Continue gradual typing migration of legacy Zipline modules (Story 8.10 or future sprints)"

implementation_highlights:
  - "mypy --strict enabled in CI/CD (.github/workflows/ci.yml:74-75)"
  - "Comprehensive mypy configuration with all strictness flags (pyproject.toml:353-368)"
  - "8 type stub packages installed for external libraries"
  - "Pre-commit hook configured with all dependencies (.pre-commit-config.yaml:22-35)"
  - "PEP 561 py.typed marker added for typed package distribution"
  - "Excellent documentation guide (docs/guides/type-hinting.md, 402 lines)"
  - "Gradual typing strategy: strict for new Epic 8 modules, relaxed for legacy (pyproject.toml:394-472)"
  - "Zero mypy errors in strict-enforced modules (verified via CLI)"
