strengths:

  - "Atomic write pattern correctly implemented (temp file + fsync + rename)"
  - "Comprehensive structured logging throughout all operations"
  - "Proper exception hierarchy with specific error types (StateError, CheckpointCorrupted, ReconciliationError)"
  - "Clean separation of concerns (models, state manager, reconciler)"
  - "All 45 tests passing with comprehensive edge case coverage"
  - "Integration tests validating realistic crash recovery scenarios"
  - "Proper async/await usage in reconciliation logic"
  - "Zero mock enforcement - no hardcoded values or mock patterns in production code"
  - "100% type hint coverage on public APIs"

review_notes: |
  This is an exemplary implementation that demonstrates production-ready code quality.
  The state management system correctly implements all critical features including:

  1. Type-safe serialization using Pydantic models with Decimal precision
  2. Atomic write guarantees preventing data corruption
  3. Comprehensive staleness detection and warning system
  4. Three reconciliation strategies (WARN_ONLY, SYNC_TO_BROKER, HALT_AND_ALERT)
  5. Proper async/await patterns for non-blocking reconciliation
  6. Structured logging for operational observability
  7. Comprehensive test coverage (45 tests, 100% pass rate)

  The implementation follows all coding standards, has zero technical debt, and includes
  proper documentation. No refactoring or fixes required.

  Minor recommendations for future enhancements are operational concerns (checkpoint
  cleanup policy) or performance optimizations for edge cases (compression for very
  large portfolios), not functional gaps.
