## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if no expert is available?
A: Expert review is mandatory for Epic 11 stories. Schedule review in advance or request extension if expert unavailable.

### Q: Can QA review replace expert review?
A: No. QA review validates process compliance; expert review validates technical correctness and quality.

### Q: How long should expert reviews take?
A: 1-3 hours for most stories. Complex or large documentation may require multiple sessions.

### Q: What if automated tests pass but expert finds issues?
A: Automated tests catch obvious errors; expert review catches subtle issues, usage patterns, and completeness gaps. Both are required.

### Q: Can I request a specific expert?
A: Yes, but ensure they're qualified for the documentation area. PM can help match experts to stories.

### Q: What if expert requests changes beyond story scope?
A: Distinguish between mandatory fixes and suggestions for future work. Document suggestions but don't block completion for out-of-scope items.
