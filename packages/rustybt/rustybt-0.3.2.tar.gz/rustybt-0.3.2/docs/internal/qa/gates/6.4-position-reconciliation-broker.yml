# Code Quality Assessment
code_quality:
  architecture: "Excellent - Clean separation of concerns, strategy pattern for reconciliation"
  patterns: "Strategy pattern for reconciliation strategies, proper async/await throughout"
  decimal_usage: "Perfect - All financial values use Decimal, no float conversions"
  error_handling: "Robust - Custom ReconciliationError, structured logging with context"
  type_hints: "Complete - All public methods have type hints"
  documentation: "Comprehensive - Docstrings for all public methods, architecture docs complete"

# Zero-Mock Compliance
zero_mock_compliance:
  status: PASS
  findings:
    - "✅ No hardcoded return values"
    - "✅ Real Decimal calculations throughout"
    - "✅ Actual discrepancy detection logic (not simplified)"
    - "✅ Tests use MockBrokerAdapter with configurable responses (test double, not mock)"
    - "✅ No TODO/FIXME without tracking"
  notes: "Full compliance with zero-mock enforcement policy"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues

  future:
    - action: "Consider adding Hypothesis property-based tests for discrepancy percentage calculations"
      refs: ["rustybt/live/reconciler.py:390-424"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Would strengthen confidence in edge cases, though current coverage is excellent"

    - action: "Add integration test with real broker adapter (paper broker) when available"
      refs: ["tests/integration/live/"]
      priority: medium
      rationale: "Would validate end-to-end reconciliation flow with actual broker API responses"
