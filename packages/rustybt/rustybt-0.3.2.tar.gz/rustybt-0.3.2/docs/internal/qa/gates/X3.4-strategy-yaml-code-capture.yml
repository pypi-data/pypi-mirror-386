# Final assessment
final_notes: |
  Exceptional implementation quality. This story demonstrates:

  ✅ Complete AC coverage with full test validation
  ✅ Outstanding test coverage (90.71%) with comprehensive edge case testing
  ✅ Zero code quality violations (black, ruff, mypy all pass)
  ✅ Excellent error handling - no failure paths crash the backtest
  ✅ Superior performance - 250x faster than requirement
  ✅ Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
  ✅ Comprehensive documentation with examples
  ✅ Proper logging at all decision points
  ✅ Configuration precedence clearly implemented and documented

  No blocking issues identified. Ready for production deployment.
