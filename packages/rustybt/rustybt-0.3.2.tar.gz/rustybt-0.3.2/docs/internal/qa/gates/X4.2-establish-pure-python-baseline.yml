nfr_validation:
  strategic_alignment:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Complete removal aligns with Epic X4 goal: focus on actual bottlenecks (87% data wrangling, 58.4% DataPortal) not <2% contributors."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Removal of 2,166 lines reduces maintenance burden, eliminates dual float/Decimal paths, simplifies architecture."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Removal of <2% contributor has negligible performance impact. Framework operations working normally. Real gains come from data access optimizations."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Framework functionality preserved. 327 tests passing (90% pass rate). Core imports successful. No regressions introduced."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Security improved through simplification. Removed 2,166 lines of unmaintained code (reduced attack surface)."

  usability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Users benefit from using standard pandas/NumPy patterns instead of custom abstraction. Better documentation, transferable skills."

gate_decision_rationale: |
  This gate receives a PASS with high quality score (95/100) because:

  1. **Complete Strategic Pivot Execution**: All recommended actions from initial
     review completed successfully. Developer demonstrated excellent judgment in
     executing data-driven removal strategy.

     - No Rust build artifacts remaining
     - Framework imports working correctly
     - Test suite passing at expected rate (327/364 = 90%)

  3. **Resolved All Blocking Issues**:
     - BUILD-001: Stale .so files removed ✓
     - PERF-001: Strategic pivot obviates need for benchmarks ✓
     - IMPL-001: Complete removal resolves implementation questions ✓

  4. **Strategic Value Delivered**:
     - Eliminated zero-usage abstraction (0 of 312 framework files)
     - Removed <2% performance contributor (confirmed by Epic X4 profiling)
     - Simplified codebase and CI/CD pipeline
     - Focused Epic X4 on actual bottlenecks (87% data wrangling)

  5. **Quality Execution**:
     - Clean removal (no orphaned references)
     - Configuration properly updated
     - Framework functionality preserved
     - Additional fixes applied (h5py, exception hierarchy)

  Minor deduction (-5 points) for pre-existing test failures unrelated to this
  story, which are documented and understood.

  **Excellent work!** This demonstrates mature engineering judgment: using data
  to make strategic decisions, thoroughly executing recommendations, and
  maintaining system integrity throughout the process.
