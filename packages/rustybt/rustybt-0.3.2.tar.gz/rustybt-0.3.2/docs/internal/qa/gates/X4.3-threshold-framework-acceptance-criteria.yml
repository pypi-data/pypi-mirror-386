# Quality Gate Decision: Story X4.3
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "X4.3"
story_title: "Threshold Framework and Acceptance Criteria"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria fully satisfied with robust implementation. 35/35 tests passing including property-based and integration tests. Statistical methods correctly implemented using paired t-test. Memory threshold properly enforced as percentage increase. Configuration system provides flexible threshold management. Production-ready."

# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Statistical calculations use well-established scipy library. Input validation in place via PerformanceThreshold.__post_init__."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Threshold evaluation is lightweight. Property-based tests demonstrate stable performance across varied input ranges. Sequential evaluation includes early stopping for efficiency."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions (InsufficientDataError, ThresholdEvaluationError). Statistical methods validated through property-based tests."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization with clear separation of concerns. Complete type hints, Google-style docstrings, frozen dataclasses. Configuration system is flexible and extensible."

# Audit trail
history:
  - at: "2025-10-23T10:00:00Z"
    gate: FAIL
    note: "Initial review - memory threshold misalignment (3x multiplier vs 2% increase) and statistical test method (two-sample vs paired t-test)"

  - at: "2025-10-23T14:00:00Z"
    gate: PASS
    note: "Fixes applied - memory threshold now percentage-based, paired t-test implemented, all 35 tests passing"

  - at: "2025-10-23T20:00:00Z"
    gate: PASS
    note: "Fresh comprehensive review confirms production-ready status. All acceptance criteria met, documentation consistent, no issues found."
