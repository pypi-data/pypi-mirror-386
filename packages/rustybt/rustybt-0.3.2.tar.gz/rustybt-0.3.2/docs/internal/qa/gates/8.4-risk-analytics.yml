# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security vulnerabilities. Proper input validation with custom exceptions. No secrets handling. Safe mathematical operations."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient numpy/pandas vectorized operations. Monte Carlo VaR uses 10,000 simulations (configurable). Risk decomposition uses optimized numpy linear algebra. Typical portfolio (<1000 observations) completes in <1s."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions (InsufficientDataError, RiskError). Property-based testing validates mathematical invariants. All edge cases handled."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation with Google-style docstrings (100% public API coverage). Clean code structure. Comprehensive tests. Proper Decimal precision throughout."

# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Gate set to PASS based on comprehensive follow-up review:

  1. All blocking issues from initial review resolved:
     âœ… AC8 risk decomposition now implements real calculations (risk.py:614-715)
     âœ… Zero-mock compliance verified (no hardcoded placeholders detected)
     âœ… Stress testing enhanced with asset-specific shocks
     âœ… RiskInsufficientDataError exported from analytics/__init__.py
     âœ… All 42 tests passing (100% success rate)

  2. Quality metrics exceed standards:
     âœ… Test coverage: 42 comprehensive tests (unit, integration, property, edge cases)
     âœ… Zero-mock validation: test_risk_decomposition_validates_calculations confirms unique outputs
     âœ… Mathematical rigor: Property-based tests validate CVaR â‰¥ VaR invariant
     âœ… Code quality: ruff linting passes, proper Decimal precision, excellent documentation

  3. NFR validation: All PASS
     âœ… Security: Proper validation, no vulnerabilities
     âœ… Performance: Efficient vectorized operations, reasonable completion times
     âœ… Reliability: Comprehensive error handling, edge cases covered
     âœ… Maintainability: Excellent documentation, clean architecture

  4. Requirements traceability: 10/10 ACs fully implemented and tested
     All acceptance criteria have corresponding tests with Given-When-Then validation

  5. Standards compliance: Full compliance
     âœ… Coding Standards: Decimal precision, docstrings, organization
     âœ… Zero-Mock Enforcement: Real calculations, no placeholders
     âœ… Testing Strategy: Comprehensive coverage, property-based testing
     âœ… Project Structure: Correct file locations, proper exports

  This implementation demonstrates exemplary quality and serves as a model for
  comprehensive risk analytics. The team's responsiveness to QA feedback and
  commitment to zero-mock enforcement is commendable.

# Next Steps for Development Team
next_steps:
  1. "âœ… Mark Story 8.4 as 'Done' in sprint tracking"
  2. "âœ… Proceed with Epic 8 remaining stories (8.5-8.10)"
  3: "âœ… Consider this implementation as reference for other analytics modules"
  4. "ðŸ“‹ Optionally: Add remaining type hints when time permits (non-blocking)"
