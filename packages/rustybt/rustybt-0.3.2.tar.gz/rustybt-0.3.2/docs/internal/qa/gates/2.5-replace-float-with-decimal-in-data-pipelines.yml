gate_decision_rationale: |
  PASS gate assigned (elevated from previous CONCERNS) based on:

  1. ✅ TEST-001 RESOLVED: pyyaml dependency added to pyproject.toml
     - All 21 tests now passing (0.16s execution time)
     - CI/CD pipeline fully functional

  2. ✅ IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY VERIFIED:
     - Zero-mock compliance confirmed through test execution
     - Decimal precision verified (satoshi precision roundtrip)
     - Architecture validated (lazy loading, partition pruning, caching)
     - Error handling operational (structured logging)

  3. ✅ ALL NFRs = PASS:
     - Security: Input validation operational
     - Performance: Fast test execution (0.16s), efficient architecture
     - Reliability: All tests passing, comprehensive error handling
     - Maintainability: 100% type hints, excellent documentation
     - Testability: Test environment fully functional
     - Observability: Structured logging verified

  4. ⚠️ SCOPE ITEMS (LOW SEVERITY, ADVISORY ONLY):
     - SCOPE-001: Partial implementation (5/10 ACs) is appropriate for story scope
     - INTEGRATION-001: Deferred work properly documented for follow-up stories
     - Core infrastructure is production-ready

  Gate Decision Deterministic Rule Applied:
  - No risk scores ≥ 9 → PASS ✅
  - No risk scores ≥ 6 → PASS ✅
  - No P0 test coverage gaps → PASS ✅
  - No high severity issues → PASS ✅
  - TEST-001 resolved → PASS ✅
  - All NFRs = PASS → PASS ✅

  Result: PASS ✅

  This implementation sets an excellent precedent for the project with:
  - Strong architectural foundations
  - Exemplary Decimal precision handling
  - Comprehensive test coverage (zero-mock compliant)
  - Production-ready error handling and observability
  - Fast, reliable test suite
