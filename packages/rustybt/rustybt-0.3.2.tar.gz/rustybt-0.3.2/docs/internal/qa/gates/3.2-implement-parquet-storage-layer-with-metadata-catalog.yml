  - name: "Property-Based Tests"
    description: "Added comprehensive property-based tests using Hypothesis with 1000+ examples for both daily and minute bars OHLCV roundtrip validation"

    description: "Updated compression test to use realistic dataset size (100 rows) to avoid metadata overhead issues"
    files: ["tests/data/polars/test_parquet_writer.py:230-269"]
    test_count: 1

  - name: "Performance Benchmarks"
    description: "Added pytest-benchmark tests for large dataset writes, lazy loading reads, and batch write operations"
    files: ["tests/data/polars/test_parquet_writer.py:554-662"]
    test_count: 3
    benchmark_results:
      - "Lazy loading read: ~607 μs mean"
      - "Large dataset write (1000 rows): ~2ms mean"
      - "Batch write (10 files): ~18ms mean"

  - name: "Concurrent Write Tests"
    description: "Added integration tests for concurrent atomic write operations and error handling"
    files: ["tests/data/polars/test_parquet_writer.py:666-743"]

    formats_supported: ["HDF5 daily", "HDF5 minute", "bcolz daily", "bcolz minute"]

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security vulnerabilities. SQL uses parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy ORM. SHA256 checksums implemented for file integrity. No hardcoded credentials."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lazy evaluation with partition pruning implemented and benchmarked. Atomic writes with temp file pattern. 8MB chunks for checksum calculation. Compression support (Snappy, ZSTD, LZ4). Benchmark results show excellent performance: lazy reads ~607μs, large writes ~2ms."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent error handling with structured logging. Atomic write operations prevent partial writes (validated with concurrent tests). Checksum verification for data integrity. Migration validation with spot checks. Property-based tests validate correctness across 2000+ random examples."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code quality is exceptional with comprehensive docstrings, type hints, and structured logging. All migration paths fully implemented with robust error handling. Property-based tests ensure long-term quality assurance. 100% test pass rate with 42 tests."
