nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      API keys loaded from environment/config file (never hardcoded).
      Security checks warn if .env not in .gitignore.
      .gitignore properly configured.
      Bearer token auth for Polygon (more secure than query params).
      API secrets never logged.
      No sensitive data in test files.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Async/await pattern throughout (non-blocking I/O).
      Connection pooling via aiohttp.ClientSession reuse.
      Rate limiting prevents API throttling.
      Efficient data structures (Polars DataFrames).
      Decimal calculations properly configured (precision=28).
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Retry logic with exponential backoff (@with_retry decorator).
      Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types.
      Rate limiter prevents quota exhaustion.
      Session cleanup in async close() method.
      Validation of OHLCV relationships before returning data.
      Timeout configured (30 seconds) for HTTP requests.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Clean abstraction: BaseAPIProviderAdapter â†’ ProviderAdapter.
      DRY principle: shared rate limiting, auth, error handling.
      Excellent documentation in code and external docs.
      Consistent naming conventions.
      Type hints enable IDE support and catch errors early.
      Test coverage enables confident refactoring.

  - "Production-ready with rate limiting, retry logic, structured logging"
  - "Type-safe with full type hints and proper abstractions"
  - "Decimal precision for all financial data"
