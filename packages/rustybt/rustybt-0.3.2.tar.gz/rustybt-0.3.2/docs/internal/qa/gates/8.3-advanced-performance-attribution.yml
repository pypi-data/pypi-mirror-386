# Quality Gate Decision for Story 8.3
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)
# Date: 2025-10-10

schema: 1
story: "8.3"
story_title: "Advanced Performance Attribution"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "Excellent implementation of core attribution analysis with 91% test coverage and zero-mock compliance. Minor concerns about file length and limited selection/interaction implementations are justified by complexity and data requirements."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Issues identified (severity: low|medium|high)
top_issues:
  - id: "MAINT-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "File length is 816 lines, exceeding the 500-line guideline in coding standards"
    suggested_action: "Consider splitting into separate modules (attribution.py, visualizations.py, factor_models.py) in future refactoring"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "IMPL-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Selection and interaction attribution have basic implementations only"
    suggested_action: "Enhance when holdings/sector data format is standardized. Current implementation correctly warns users about limitations."
