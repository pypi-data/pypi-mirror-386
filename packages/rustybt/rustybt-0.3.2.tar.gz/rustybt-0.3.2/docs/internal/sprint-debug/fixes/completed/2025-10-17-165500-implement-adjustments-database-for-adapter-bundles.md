## Issues Found

**Issue 1: Empty Adjustments Database in Adapter Bundles** - `rustybt/data/bundles/adapter_bundles.py:805-810`
- Bundle functions receive `adjustment_writer` parameter but never pass it to `_create_bundle_from_adapter()`
- Results in empty `adjustments.sqlite` (0 bytes) with no tables created
- Missing required tables: `mergers`, `dividends`, `splits`, `stock_dividend_payouts`

**Issue 2: CLI Strategies Fail with sqlite3.OperationalError** - User-reported
- Strategies using `data.history()` fail: `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: mergers`
- Error occurs in adjustment reader when loading pricing adjustments
- Blocks CLI quick start path and any strategy requiring historical corporate actions

**Issue 3: YFinance Adapter Methods Not Called** - `rustybt/data/adapters/yfinance_adapter.py:199-299`
- Adapter has `fetch_splits()` and `fetch_dividends()` methods implemented
- Methods exist but never called during bundle ingestion
- Corporate action data available but not utilized

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why did this issue occur:**
The adapter bundle bridge functions were designed to be generic and handle OHLCV data, but corporate actions support was never integrated. The `adjustment_writer` parameter was added to bundle function signatures (for API consistency with csvdir/quandl bundles) but the actual fetching and writing logic was never implemented. This created a "silent failure" where bundles appeared to ingest successfully but were missing critical adjustment data.

**What pattern should prevent recurrence:**
1. **Mandatory parameter usage validation** - If a parameter is accepted, it must be used or explicitly documented as "reserved for future use"
2. **Integration testing with real strategies** - Test CLI execution with strategies that require corporate actions, not just bundle ingestion
3. **Database schema validation** - After bundle creation, verify all expected tables exist and contain data
4. **Comprehensive logging** - Log when optional features (like adjustments) are skipped vs. when they fail

## Fixes Applied

**1. Added adjustment transformation functions** - `rustybt/data/bundles/adapter_bundles.py:259-420`

Created two transformation functions to convert adapter output format to SQLiteAdjustmentWriter format:

- `_transform_splits_for_writer(splits_data, asset_metadata)` - Transforms splits data
  - Input: `dict[symbol -> pl.DataFrame{date, symbol, split_ratio}]`
  - Output: `pd.DataFrame{sid, effective_date, ratio}`
  - Maps symbols to SIDs using asset_metadata
  - Handles both Polars and pandas DataFrames

- `_transform_dividends_for_writer(dividends_data, asset_metadata)` - Transforms dividends data
  - Input: `dict[symbol -> pl.DataFrame{date, symbol, dividend}]`
  - Output: `pd.DataFrame{sid, ex_date, declared_date, record_date, pay_date, amount}`
  - Sets NaT for dates not provided by YFinance (declared_date, record_date)
  - Uses ex_date as both ex_date and pay_date (YFinance limitation)

**2. Integrated adjustment fetching into bundle creation** - `rustybt/data/bundles/adapter_bundles.py:624-680`

Modified `_create_bundle_from_adapter()` to fetch and write corporate actions:
- Added check for `adjustment_writer` in writers dict
- Added check for `fetch_splits` and `fetch_dividends` methods on adapter
- Fetch splits and dividends with async support (`asyncio.run()` if coroutine)
- Transform data using helper functions
- Write to adjustment_writer with error handling
- Log splits_count and dividends_count for verification
- Graceful degradation: Log warning if fetch fails, continue without adjustments

**3. Updated all bundle functions to pass adjustment_writer** - `rustybt/data/bundles/adapter_bundles.py:1030, 1104, 1168, 1236`

Modified all four adapter bundle functions to include `adjustment_writer` in writers dict:
- `yfinance_profiling_bundle()` - Line 1030
- `ccxt_hourly_profiling_bundle()` - Line 1104
- `ccxt_minute_profiling_bundle()` - Line 1168
- `csv_profiling_bundle()` - Line 1236

## Tests Added/Modified

**Added 7 comprehensive tests** - `tests/data/bundles/test_adapter_bundles.py:777-1046`

All tests use REAL data (zero-mock enforcement):

1. `test_transform_splits_for_writer_with_real_data()` - Tests with historical AAPL/TSLA splits
   - AAPL: 4:1 split on 2020-08-31
   - TSLA: 5:1 split on 2020-08-31, 3:1 split on 2022-08-25
   - Verifies SID mapping, data types, column presence

2. `test_transform_splits_for_writer_empty_data()` - Edge case: no splits data

3. `test_transform_splits_for_writer_unknown_symbol()` - Error handling: symbol not in metadata

4. `test_transform_dividends_for_writer_with_real_data()` - Tests with historical AAPL/MSFT dividends
   - AAPL: Quarterly dividends ($0.23-$0.24)
   - MSFT: Quarterly dividends ($0.68)
   - Verifies NaT handling for missing dates

5. `test_transform_dividends_for_writer_empty_data()` - Edge case: no dividends data

6. `test_transform_dividends_for_writer_unknown_symbol()` - Error handling: symbol not in metadata

7. `test_transform_splits_and_dividends_pandas_input()` - Compatibility: works with pandas DataFrames

## Documentation Updated

N/A - Internal implementation fix, no user-facing API changes. Comprehensive docstrings added to transformation functions with usage examples.

## Notes

**Live Ingestion Test Results:**
```
2025-10-17 16:51:18 [info] bridge_fetching_adjustments bundle=yfinance-profiling symbols_count=20
2025-10-17 16:52:11 [info] adjustment_transform_splits_complete count=93
2025-10-17 16:52:11 [info] adjustment_transform_dividends_complete count=2189
```

**Splits Fetched by Symbol:**
- AAPL: 5, MSFT: 9, GOOGL: 2, AMZN: 4, NVDA: 6, TSLA: 2, V: 1, JNJ: 7, WMT: 10, JPM: 4, MA: 1, PG: 6, UNH: 5, HD: 13, DIS: 8, BAC: 3, XOM: 5, COST: 2

**Dividends Fetched by Symbol:**
- Total: 2189 dividends across 18 symbols (AAPL: 88, MSFT: 87, GOOGL: 6, NVDA: 52, META: 7, V: 69, JNJ: 255, WMT: 205, JPM: 168, MA: 77, PG: 256, UNH: 83, HD: 153, DIS: 128, BAC: 158, XOM: 254, COST: 91, ABBV: 52)

**Design Decisions:**
1. **Graceful degradation** - If adjustment fetching fails, log warning and continue. Bundle is still usable for strategies that don't require corporate actions.
2. **Async support** - Check if adapter methods return coroutines and handle with `asyncio.run()`. Supports both sync and async adapters.
3. **Polars/pandas compatibility** - Transformation functions detect DataFrame type and handle both seamlessly.
4. **NaT handling** - YFinance only provides ex_date and amount for dividends. Other required dates (declared_date, record_date) set to NaT, which SQLiteAdjustmentWriter handles correctly.

**Known Limitations:**
- YFinance dividends: declared_date and record_date not available (set to NaT)
- YFinance dividends: Using ex_date as pay_date approximation
- Some historical dividends produce warnings during ratio calculation (very small amounts before stock splits)

**Next Steps:**
1. Consider adding adjustment support to CCXT adapter (crypto exchanges typically don't have splits/dividends, but some tokens have distributions)
2. Add CSV adapter adjustment support (read from separate splits.csv and dividends.csv files)
3. Create integration test that runs CLI strategy requiring `data.history()` to verify end-to-end functionality
