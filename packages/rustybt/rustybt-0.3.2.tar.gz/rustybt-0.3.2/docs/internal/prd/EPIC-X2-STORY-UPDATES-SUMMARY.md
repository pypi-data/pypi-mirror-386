## Detailed Changes by Story

### ‚úÖ **Story X2.1: Security & Test Infrastructure** (UPDATED)

**File:** `docs/stories/X2.1.p0-security-test-infrastructure.story.md`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Added Task 0:** File Discovery (Before Implementation)
   - Grep commands to identify SQL f-strings and requests.* calls
   - Addresses validation finding: "TBD based on grep" items need upfront identification
2. **Added Change Log section** (template requirement)
3. **Moved Property-Based Testing to X2.1B:**
   - AC 8 now a placeholder referencing X2.1B
   - Maintains P0 focus on security fixes
4. **Updated Success Metrics:**
   - Added "File discovery: ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ"
   - Added "Property-based testing: Deferred to Story X2.1B"
5. **Updated Definition of Done:**
   - Added Task 0 completion requirement
