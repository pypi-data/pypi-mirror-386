# MVP Scope

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on validating the core value proposition: financial-grade Decimal arithmetic + intelligent caching + modern data architecture + professional-grade optimization and transaction cost modeling.

**MVP = Epics 1-5**:
- **Epic 1**: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- **Epic 2**: Financial Integrity - Decimal Arithmetic
- **Epic 3**: Modern Data Architecture (CCXT + YFinance + CSV adapters)
- **Epic 4**: Enhanced Transaction Costs & Multi-Strategy Portfolio
- **Epic 5**: Strategy Optimization & Robustness Testing

**MVP Delivers**:
- Functional enhanced backtester with audit-compliant Decimal arithmetic
- Intelligent caching enabling instant data retrieval for repeated backtests
- Core data sources for crypto (CCXT) and equities (YFinance) plus custom data (CSV)
- Realistic transaction cost modeling and multi-strategy support
- Comprehensive optimization and robustness testing tools
- Complete testing, examples, and documentation integrated throughout all epics

**Out of MVP Scope** (Epics 6-9):
- **Epic 6**: Live Trading Engine & Broker Integrations
- **Epic 7**: Performance Optimization - Rust Integration
- **Epic 8**: Analytics & Production Readiness
- **Epic 9**: RESTful API & WebSocket Interface (lowest priority)

**Phasing Strategy**: All epics will be implemented incrementally, but Epics 1-5 establish the validated foundation before proceeding to production deployment capabilities (Epics 6-9).
