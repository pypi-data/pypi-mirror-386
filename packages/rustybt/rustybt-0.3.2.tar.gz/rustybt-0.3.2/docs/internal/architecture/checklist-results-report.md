## Top 5 Risks and Mitigations

**1. Decimal Arithmetic Performance (MEDIUM RISK)**
- **Risk:** <30% overhead target (NFR3) may be challenging with pure Python Decimal
- **Mitigation:** Epic 7 Rust optimization with profiling-driven approach, Polars performance gains offset overhead
- **Timeline Impact:** No impact on MVP (Epics 1-5), addressed post-MVP

**2. Data Migration Complexity (MEDIUM RISK)**
- **Risk:** Users have large bcolz bundles that need conversion to Parquet
- **Mitigation:** `rustybt bundle migrate` CLI tool with dual-format read support during transition
- **Timeline Impact:** Requires Epic 3 completion before users can migrate

**3. Breaking API Compatibility (LOW RISK)**
- **Risk:** Zipline users must rewrite strategies for Decimal types
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive migration guide, example conversions, gradual adoption via feature flags
- **Timeline Impact:** Documentation effort in Epic 1

**4. Live Trading State Recovery (MEDIUM RISK)**
- **Risk:** Crash during order execution could result in position mismatch
- **Mitigation:** Order audit log with transaction-level granularity, broker reconciliation on startup
- **Timeline Impact:** Epic 6 implementation complexity

**5. Broker API Rate Limits (LOW RISK)**
- **Risk:** Exceeding broker rate limits during live trading
- **Mitigation:** APScheduler with configurable intervals, exponential backoff, circuit breakers
- **Timeline Impact:** Epic 6 testing requirements

## Recommendations

**Must-Fix Before Development:**
- ✅ All items addressed in current architecture

**Should-Fix for Better Quality:**
1. **Add sequence diagrams** for live trading order flow (Epic 6) - Currently only component diagrams
2. **Specify Parquet schema versions** - Currently implicit, should be versioned like asset DB
3. **Define Rust module API** - Epic 7 Rust optimization needs clearer Python/Rust boundary

**Nice-to-Have Improvements:**
1. Performance benchmarking targets with specific metrics (e.g., "2-year backtest on 50 assets in <10 minutes")
2. Disaster recovery runbook for live trading server failures
3. Multi-strategy portfolio allocation algorithm comparison matrix

## AI Implementation Readiness

**✅ EXCELLENT** - Architecture is highly suitable for AI agent implementation

**Strengths:**
1. Clear module boundaries with single responsibilities
2. Consistent patterns (BarReader interface, BrokerAdapter abstraction)
3. Comprehensive code examples (DecimalLedger, PolarsBarReader, CCXTAdapter)
4. Explicit integration points with Zipline modules (KEEP, EXTEND, NEW markers)
5. Detailed source tree structure with file placement guidance

**Areas Needing Additional Clarification:**
1. **Decimal precision rules:** Document when to use `ROUND_HALF_EVEN` vs `ROUND_DOWN` (add to coding standards)
2. **Polars lazy evaluation:** Specify when to call `.collect()` to materialize results
3. **Async/await boundaries:** Clarify which components use async (broker adapters, data feeds) vs sync (algorithm callbacks)

**Complexity Hotspots:**
1. **PolarsDataPortal** - Complex adjustment application logic (Zipline's AdjustedArray pattern)
2. **LiveTradingEngine** - State machine for order lifecycle management
3. **Pipeline engine integration** - Polars compatibility with existing pipeline computations

**Recommendations:**
- Break PolarsDataPortal into smaller sub-components (AdjustmentEngine, HistoryManager, BarDispatcher)
- Provide state diagram for LiveTradingEngine order lifecycle
- Create Epic 4 spike story for Pipeline + Polars integration feasibility
