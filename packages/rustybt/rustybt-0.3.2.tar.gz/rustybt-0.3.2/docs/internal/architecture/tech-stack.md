## Technology Stack Rationale

### uv as Package Manager
- **Speed**: 10-100x faster than pip for package installation and resolution
- **Deterministic**: Lockfile-based dependency resolution for reproducible builds
- **Modern**: Written in Rust, actively developed by Astral (creators of ruff)
- **Developer Experience**: Single tool for virtual environment and package management
- **CI/CD Performance**: Significantly reduces GitHub Actions build times

### Polars over Pandas
- **Performance**: 5-10x faster for large datasets, lazy evaluation, parallel execution
- **Memory**: Columnar memory layout, efficient for OHLCV data
- **Interoperability**: Arrow backend enables zero-copy with Parquet
- **Modern**: Active development, first-class Rust core

### Parquet over bcolz/HDF5
- **Standardization**: Industry-standard columnar format (Apache Arrow ecosystem)
- **Size**: 50-80% smaller than HDF5 with comparable compression
- **Interoperability**: Works with Spark, DuckDB, Polars, pandas, countless tools
- **Maintenance**: Active ecosystem vs. bcolz (unmaintained since 2018)

### FastAPI for REST API (Epic 9)
- **Performance**: Comparable to Go/Node.js, async-native
- **Developer Experience**: Auto-generated OpenAPI docs, Pydantic validation
- **Modern**: Type hints, async/await, WebSocket support

### Multiple Broker Libraries (Not Just CCXT)
- **Flexibility**: CCXT for broad exchange support, native SDKs for performance/features
- **Reliability**: Native SDKs often more stable, better error handling
- **Features**: Native SDKs expose exchange-specific features CCXT doesn't standardize

## Removed Technologies (Deprecated from Zipline)

| Technology | Reason for Removal |
|------------|-------------------|
| **bcolz-zipline** | Unmaintained since 2018, replaced by Parquet/Polars |
| **h5py / tables (PyTables)** | Slow for large datasets, poor interoperability, replaced by Parquet |
| **pandas** (as primary) | Still supported for compatibility but Polars is primary |
| **numpy** (for storage) | Still used for numerical operations but not primary data structure |
| **Cython** (for new code) | Complex to maintain, keep existing Cython modules until profiled |

## Removed Technologies (Epic X4 - Phase 4)

**Note**: Epic X4 profiling revealed Rust micro-operations provide <2% end-to-end impact on optimization workflows. Complete removal simplifies build system and establishes pure Python baseline for benchmarking.

| Technology | Reason for Removal | Impact Analysis |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Rust micro-operations** | <2% end-to-end workflow impact, unnecessary complexity | Profiling showed 87% overhead in data wrangling, 0.6% in computation (already optimal) |
| **PyO3 bindings** | Rust removal dependency | No longer needed after Rust removal |
| **maturin** | Rust build tool, no longer needed | Simplifies build system, removes Rust toolchain requirement |
| **setuptools-rust** | Rust compilation integration | Simplifies CI/CD pipeline, faster builds |

**Key Finding**: Phase 3 profiling (see `specs/002-performance-benchmarking-optimization/profiling-results/`) revealed actual bottlenecks are in data access layer (87% user code overhead, 58.4% DataPortal overhead), not computation. Simple caching and pre-grouping strategies yield 70-95% speedup vs. <2% from Rust micro-operations.
