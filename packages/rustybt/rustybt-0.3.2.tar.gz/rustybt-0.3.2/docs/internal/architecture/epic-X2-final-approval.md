## Implementation Guidance

### Story Execution Order (STRICT)

**Must follow P0 → P1 → P2 sequence:**

1. **Story X2.1 (P0)** - Security & Test Infrastructure
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 development days
   - BLOCKS: X2.2 (test suite must be operational first)
   - Priority: CRITICAL

2. **Story X2.2 (P1)** - Code Quality & Dependencies
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 development days
   - BLOCKS: X2.3 (clean codebase required for validation)
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Note: Large-scale reformatting—coordinate with team

3. **Story X2.3 (P2)** - Production Validation & Docs
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days active + 30-day monitoring
   - BLOCKS: Production deployment
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Note: Paper trading validation may extend beyond story timeline

### Key Implementation Notes

**Zero-Mock Enforcement (X2.2):**
- Create scripts FIRST before implementing CI jobs
- Test scripts locally before adding to CI
- Pre-commit hooks are opt-in initially (don't break existing workflow)
- Document forbidden patterns clearly in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Property-Based Testing (X2.1):**
- Start with simple properties (commutativity, associativity)
- Run hypothesis locally first (can be slow)
- Configure hypothesis profiles for CI (faster)
- Document test failures (hypothesis shrinks to minimal example)

**CI/CD Pipeline (X2.2):**
- Implement jobs incrementally (code-quality → security → testing → etc.)
- Test each job in isolation before enabling as BLOCKING
- Branch protection rules come last (after jobs proven stable)
- Monitor CI performance (target: <5 min total time)

**Performance Regression (X2.3):**
- Establish baseline EARLY in development
- Run benchmarks on consistent hardware
- Document acceptable degradation reasons
- Performance job on main only (not on every PR)

## Confidence Assessment

**Architectural Confidence:** 98%

**Why 98% (not 100%):**
- 2% uncertainty in execution quality (implementation details matter)
- Zero-mock detection scripts need careful design (avoiding false positives)
- Property-based tests need thoughtful property selection
- CI pipeline needs tuning for performance vs. thoroughness

**Mitigations:**
- Detailed specifications provided reduce implementation uncertainty
- Examples and templates included in stories
- Testing strategy provides validation checkpoints
- Rollback plans documented for each story

**Recommendation:** Proceed with high confidence. Implementation quality will determine success, but foundation is solid.
