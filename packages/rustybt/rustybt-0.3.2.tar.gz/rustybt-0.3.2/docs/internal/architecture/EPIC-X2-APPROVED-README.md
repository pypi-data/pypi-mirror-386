## üöÄ Next Steps

### For Development Team:

**1. Review Updated Stories**
- Read X2.1, X2.2, X2.3 story files
- Note new requirements (zero-mock enforcement, property-based tests)
- Estimate effort for sprint planning

**2. Start with Story X2.1 (P0)**
- Security hotfixes (tarfile, exec/eval, SQL, timeouts)
- Test infrastructure (markers, coverage)
- Property-based testing (hypothesis)
- **Blocks:** X2.2 and X2.3

**3. Follow with Story X2.2 (P1)**
- Code quality baseline (ruff, black, mypy)
- **Zero-mock enforcement scripts (CRITICAL)**
- CI/CD pipeline implementation
- Dependency hygiene
- **Blocks:** X2.3

**4. Complete with Story X2.3 (P2)**
- Operational validation (broker, data, benchmarks)
- 30-day paper trading (‚â•99.9% uptime target)
- Documentation fixes

### For PM/Product:

**1. Update Roadmap**
- Epic X2 approved for development
- Estimated timeline: 5-8 days active development + 30-day paper trading
- Production deployment gates defined

**2. Communicate Policy Changes**
- Zero-Mock Enforcement policy now mandatory
- Pre-commit hooks will be required
- Property-based testing standard for financial code

**3. Sprint Planning**
- Story X2.1 ‚Üí Sprint N (priority: CRITICAL)
- Story X2.2 ‚Üí Sprint N+1 (coordinate large reformatting)
- Story X2.3 ‚Üí Sprint N+2 (validation and monitoring)

## üéñÔ∏è Key Achievements

### From Conditional to Full Approval

**Before Remediation:**
- ‚ùå 2 BLOCKING gaps
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 75% compliant (15/20 standards)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional approval only

**After Remediation:**
- ‚úÖ 0 BLOCKING gaps
- ‚úÖ 100% compliant (20/20 standards)
- ‚úÖ Full unconditional approval

### Critical Features Added

**Zero-Mock Enforcement (Mandatory):**
- Automated detection scripts
- CI pipeline integration (BLOCKING)
- Pre-commit hooks
- Comprehensive validation
- Clear policy documentation

**Property-Based Testing:**
- Hypothesis framework integration
- 1000+ examples per test
- Decimal arithmetic validation
- Financial calculation verification

**Complete CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Code quality gates (ruff, black, mypy, complexity)
- Security gates (bandit, truffleHog, detect-secrets)
- Testing gates (unit, property, coverage)
- Performance gates (regression, benchmarks)
- Dependency gates (safety, pip-audit, license check)

## üí° Important Notes

### Story Execution Order (STRICT)

**MUST follow P0 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2:**

1. X2.1 (P0) ‚Üí Security & Testing (1-2 days)
2. X2.2 (P1) ‚Üí Code Quality & CI/CD (2-3 days) - **BLOCKS X2.3**
3. X2.3 (P2) ‚Üí Validation & Docs (2-3 days + 30-day monitoring)

### Zero-Mock Enforcement (Critical)

**What it means:**
- No hardcoded return values (return 10, return True)
- No mock/fake/stub function names
- All validators must reject invalid data
- Different inputs must produce different outputs

**Why it matters:**
- Cornerstone of RustyBT quality policy
- Prevents technical debt accumulation
- Ensures real implementations, not placeholders
- Mandatory for production readiness

**Implementation:**
- Create detection scripts FIRST
- Test locally before CI integration
- Document forbidden patterns clearly
- Pre-commit hooks opt-in initially

### Property-Based Testing (Important)

**What it means:**
- Hypothesis generates 1000+ test examples automatically
- Tests mathematical properties (commutativity, associativity, identity)
- Validates Decimal arithmetic correctness
- Higher confidence than unit tests alone

**Why it matters:**
- Financial calculations must be mathematically correct
- Decimal precision critical for audit compliance
- Property tests catch edge cases unit tests miss

**Implementation:**
- Start with simple properties
- Run locally first (can be slow)
- Configure CI profile for speed
- Document shrunk examples
