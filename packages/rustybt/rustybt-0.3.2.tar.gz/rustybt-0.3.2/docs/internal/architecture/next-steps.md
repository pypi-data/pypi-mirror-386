# Next Steps

## Handoff to Development Teams

**Epic 1-5 (MVP):**
1. Development team reviews architecture document
2. Architect conducts architecture walkthrough session
3. Team breaks down epics into implementation tasks
4. Assign tasks to developers based on expertise
5. Begin implementation with Epic 1 (Foundation)

**Epic 6-9 (Post-MVP):**
1. Validate MVP with real-world backtests
2. Collect user feedback on API design
3. Re-assess priorities based on user needs
4. Plan Epic 6 (Live Trading) when MVP complete
