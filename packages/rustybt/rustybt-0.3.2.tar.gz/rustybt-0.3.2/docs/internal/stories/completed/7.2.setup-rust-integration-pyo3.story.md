## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** developer,

4. CI/CD updated to build Rust modules (install Rust toolchain, run maturin build)
5. Python package setup.py or pyproject.toml updated to include Rust extension
6. Example Rust function callable from Python (e.g., `rustybt.rust_sum(a, b)`)
7. Tests validate Python → Rust → Python roundtrip works correctly
8. Build documentation explains Rust setup for contributors
9. Development workflow documented (edit Rust, rebuild, test from Python)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 7.1: Profile Python Implementation to Identify Bottlenecks]
- Story 7.1 establishes profiling infrastructure to identify optimization targets
- Profiling results will drive which functions to implement in Rust (Story 7.3)
- This story (7.2) sets up the Rust integration infrastructure
- Example rust_sum function validates PyO3 integration works before optimization begins

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack - Rust & PyO3:**
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Rust 1.90+: Performance optimization (post-profiling)
- PyO3 0.26+: Python/Rust bridge (supports Python 3.12-3.14)
- rust-decimal 1.37+: Rust Decimal type for financial calculations
- maturin: Build tool for PyO3 Python extensions
- Python 3.12+: Primary development language

**PyO3 Integration Pattern:**
[Source: Epic 7 Story 7.2 Acceptance Criteria]
- Rust workspace at rust/ directory (separate from Python source)
- PyO3 0.26+ with extension-module feature
- maturin as build backend for Python extensions
- Module naming: rustybt._rustybt (private), exposed via rustybt/__init__.py
- CI/CD builds Rust modules on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
[Source: Epic 7 Story 7.2 AC 10]
- Linux: Ubuntu 22.04+ (GitHub Actions default)
- macOS: macOS 13+ (GitHub Actions)
- Windows: Windows 10+ (GitHub Actions)
- maturin handles platform-specific wheel building
- Rust stable toolchain (latest stable version)

### File Locations
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**New Files to Create:**
- rust/Cargo.toml (Rust workspace configuration)
- rust/src/lib.rs (PyO3 module entry point with rust_sum example)
- rust/.gitignore (Rust build artifacts)
- rust/pyproject.toml (maturin build configuration)
- rustybt/__init__.py (update to expose Rust functions)
- tests/rust/test_rust_integration.py (Python → Rust → Python tests)
- docs/development/rust-setup.md (build and development documentation)
- scripts/build_rust.sh (Unix build script)
- scripts/build_rust.bat (Windows build script)

**Files to Modify:**
- pyproject.toml (add maturin build-system dependency)
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (add Rust toolchain and build steps)
- Makefile (add rust-build, rust-test, rust-dev targets)

**Rust Source Tree Structure:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#rust-directory]
```
rust/
├── Cargo.toml           # Rust package manifest
├── pyproject.toml       # maturin build configuration
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs          # PyO3 module entry point
│   ├── decimal.rs      # Decimal arithmetic (Story 7.3)
│   ├── data.rs         # Data processing (Story 7.3)
│   └── indicators.rs   # Technical indicators (Story 7.3)
└── build.rs            # Build script (if needed)
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Python 3.12+ required (PyO3 0.26+ supports 3.12-3.14)
- Type hints: 100% coverage (applies to Python wrapper code)
- Rust: Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` for formatting and linting
- Documentation: Docstrings for all public Rust functions exposed to Python
- Logging: Rust code should use `log` crate, integrated with Python structlog

**Rust Coding Standards:**
- Use Rust 2021 edition
- Follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case for functions, PascalCase for types)
- Use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations (convert to Python exceptions via PyO3)
- Add unit tests in Rust: `cargo test`
- Document public APIs with `///` doc comments (Rustdoc)
- Run `cargo clippy` for linting (no warnings allowed)
- Run `cargo fmt` for formatting (consistent style)

### Integration Points
- PyO3 converts Rust types to Python types automatically (i64 → int, f64 → float, String → str)
- Rust functions return `PyResult<T>` to allow error handling in Python
- Python imports from rustybt._rustybt (private module built by maturin)
- rustybt/__init__.py re-exports public Rust functions
- CI/CD builds Rust extensions on push/PR (same workflow as Python tests)

### PyO3 Example Patterns

**Basic Function:**
```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pyfunction]
fn rust_sum(a: i64, b: i64) -> PyResult<i64> {
    Ok(a + b)
}

#[pymodule]
fn _rustybt(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(rust_sum, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

**Function with Error Handling:**
```rust
#[pyfunction]
fn divide(a: f64, b: f64) -> PyResult<f64> {
    if b == 0.0 {
        Err(PyErr::new::<pyo3::exceptions::PyValueError, _>(
            "Division by zero"
        ))
    } else {
        Ok(a / b)
    }
}
```

**Python Usage:**
```python
from rustybt import rust_sum, divide

result = rust_sum(2, 3)  # Returns 5
result = divide(10.0, 2.0)  # Returns 5.0
result = divide(10.0, 0.0)  # Raises ValueError
```

### Development Workflow
1. Edit Rust code in rust/src/
2. Build extension: `maturin develop` (installs in current venv)
3. Test from Python: `pytest tests/rust/`
4. Iterate: edit → build → test
5. Release build: `maturin build --release` (creates wheel in target/wheels/)
6. CI/CD automatically builds and tests on push

### Expected Challenges
- **Platform-specific build issues**: maturin may require platform-specific dependencies
- **Python version compatibility**: Ensure PyO3 0.26+ works with Python 3.12-3.14
- **CI/CD caching**: Rust builds can be slow, need to cache target/ directory
- **Import errors**: Ensure maturin develop installs extension in correct location
- **Type conversion**: PyO3 automatic type conversion may need custom handling for Decimal

## Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Location:**
- Unit tests: tests/rust/test_rust_integration.py (Python tests)
- Rust unit tests: rust/src/lib.rs (inline tests with #[cfg(test)])

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit test coverage: ≥90% for Rust integration wrapper code
- Rust tests: `cargo test` must pass with 100% success
- Python tests: Validate Python → Rust → Python roundtrip
- Cross-platform tests: Run on Linux, macOS, Windows in CI/CD

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Import rust_sum from rustybt package successfully
- rust_sum(2, 3) returns 5
- rust_sum with negative numbers: rust_sum(-10, 5) returns -5
- rust_sum with zero: rust_sum(0, 0) returns 0
- rust_sum with large integers (i64 range)
- Type errors: rust_sum("2", "3") raises TypeError
- Type errors: rust_sum(2.5, 3.5) raises TypeError (expects i64, not float)
- CI/CD builds Rust extension on all platforms

**Test Fixtures:**
- No special fixtures needed for basic integration tests
- Use @pytest.mark.rust marker for Rust integration tests
- Allow skipping Rust tests if Rust toolchain not installed: `pytest -m "not rust"`

**Rust Unit Tests:**
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_rust_sum() {
        assert_eq!(rust_sum(2, 3).unwrap(), 5);
        assert_eq!(rust_sum(-10, 5).unwrap(), -5);
        assert_eq!(rust_sum(0, 0).unwrap(), 0);
    }
}
```

**Python Integration Tests:**
```python
import pytest

pytestmark = pytest.mark.rust

def test_rust_sum_basic():
    from rustybt import rust_sum
    assert rust_sum(2, 3) == 5

def test_rust_sum_negative():
    from rustybt import rust_sum
    assert rust_sum(-10, 5) == -5

def test_rust_sum_type_error():
    from rustybt import rust_sum
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        rust_sum("2", "3")
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

PyO3 is pinned to 0.23 despite AC #2 requiring 0.26+, which blocks Python 3.13/3.14 support and contradicts the inline comments. The Rust crate is set up as a single package rather than a Cargo workspace, so future multi-crate expansion (called out in AC #1) would require restructuring. The root Python packaging remains on pure setuptools and never invokes maturin, so standard `pip install .` flows ship without the Rust extension (violates AC #5). CI installs the toolchain and runs `maturin develop`, but the rust `pyproject.toml` forces `compatibility = "linux"`, preventing Windows/macOS wheels and undermining AC #10. Tests executed: `pytest tests/rust/test_rust_integration.py -q` (pass after manual `maturin develop`).

### Refactoring Performed

None.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ PyO3 version and workspace expectations from story/coding standards not met.
- Project Structure: ✗ Missing workspace layout and packaging integration for the Rust crate.
- Testing Strategy: ✗ CI cannot exercise Rust tests on non-Linux platforms due to packaging config.
- All ACs Met: ✗ ACs 1, 2, 5, and 10 remain unmet (see findings above).

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Bump PyO3 to >=0.26 with matching `abi3` feature set and update docs/tests accordingly.
- [ ] Convert `rust/Cargo.toml` into a workspace root (or document alternative) per AC #1.
- [ ] Update repository packaging (`pyproject.toml`/`setup.py`) to build and ship the Rust extension via maturin.
- [ ] Fix `[tool.maturin]` compatibility so macOS and Windows builds succeed (remove `linux` hard-code, add universal settings).
- [ ] Ensure CI exercises Rust unit/integration tests across supported platforms after the packaging fix.

### Security Review

No new security issues noted; changes are build/tooling related.

### Performance Considerations

Not evaluated pending resolution of packaging compatibility gaps.

### Files Modified During Review

None (read-only QA review).

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/7.2-setup-rust-integration-pyo3.yml

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above

### Review Date: 2025-10-08 (Documentation Follow-up)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Build and packaging flows remain healthy (`.venv/bin/python -m build` finishes with wheels containing `_rustybt`), and the Rust extension still imports cleanly after `maturin develop`. CI config and workspace structure continue to satisfy ACs 1-7 & 10. However, `docs/development/rust-setup.md` still directs developers to downgrade to PyO3 0.23 in the “Common Errors” section, which conflicts with the enforced 0.26 baseline and risks regressions when troubleshooting (violates ACs 8 & 9 until corrected).

### Refactoring Performed

None (analysis-only review).

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code and packaging align with architecture guidance.
- Project Structure: ✓ Workspace + setuptools-rust integration intact.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Rust integration tests and packaging validation executed.
- All ACs Met: ✗ Documentation update outstanding (ACs 8 & 9).

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Rebuilt Rust extension via `../.venv/bin/maturin develop`.
- [x] Re-ran `pytest tests/rust/test_rust_integration.py -q` (10/10 passing).
- [x] Revalidated packaging using `.venv/bin/python -m build`.
- [ ] Update `docs/development/rust-setup.md` “Common Errors” to reference PyO3 0.26 and workspace-based remediation steps.

### Security Review

No new security considerations; review limited to build/test flows and documentation.

### Performance Considerations

ABI3 artifacts still generated; no perf regressions observed in validation commands.

### Files Modified During Review

None (read-only checks plus automated builds/tests).

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/7.2-setup-rust-integration-pyo3.yml

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above

### Review Date: 2025-10-08 (Final Review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

`setup.py` now targets `rust/crates/rustybt/Cargo.toml`, the workspace pins `pyo3 = 0.26` with `extension-module`/`abi3-py312`, and both `maturin develop` and the standard build pipeline succeed (`.venv/bin/python -m build` completed and emitted wheels containing `rustybt._rustybt`). CI exercises Linux/macOS/Windows, provisions the Rust toolchain, and validates `rust_sum` imports after an editable install. Tests continue to cover Python ⇄ Rust paths via `pytest tests/rust/test_rust_integration.py -q`. The remaining gap is in `docs/development/rust-setup.md`, whose “Common Errors” section still advises reverting to PyO3 0.23—this contradicts the new baseline and should be updated for accuracy.

### Refactoring Performed

None (read-only QA review).

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Workspace layout and PyO3 configuration align with architecture guidance.
- Project Structure: ✓ Python packaging integrates the Rust extension through setuptools-rust as required.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Rust integration tests run via pytest; CI matrix covers all target OSes.
- All ACs Met: ✗ Documentation needs a quick PyO3 version correction (see improvements).

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Validated packaging by running `.venv/bin/python -m build` after `maturin develop`.
- [x] Re-ran `pytest tests/rust/test_rust_integration.py -q` to confirm Python ⇄ Rust coverage.
- [ ] Update `docs/development/rust-setup.md` “Common Errors” guidance to reference PyO3 0.26 and current workspace instructions.

### Security Review

No new security exposure observed; Rust integration remains internal-only.

### Performance Considerations

ABI3 builds are produced in both dev and release flows; no performance regressions detected during verification.

### Files Modified During Review

None (tests and builds executed only).

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/7.2-setup-rust-integration-pyo3.yml

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above

### Review Date: 2025-10-08 (Re-review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Re-review confirms PyO3 is now 0.26 and the Rust code sits in a proper workspace (`rust/crates/rustybt`). However, packaging remains broken: both `python -m build` and `pip install -e .` fail because `setup.py` still points the RustExtension to the virtual manifest at `rust/Cargo.toml`, so the Rust module is never built during standard installs (violating AC #5 and breaking CI's `uv pip install -e .`). The workspace-specific `maturin` flow works when invoked from `rust/`, and the Python integration tests continue to pass. Commands executed: `cd rust && maturin develop`, `pytest tests/rust/test_rust_integration.py -q`, `python -m build` (fails), and `pip install -e .` (fails).

### Refactoring Performed

None.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Workspace + PyO3 version now align with story guidance.
- Project Structure: ✗ Packaging integration via setuptools-rust is misconfigured (RustExtension path).
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Standard install/build flows fail, so CI cannot validate Rust integration.
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC #5 (and consequently AC #4/#10) still not satisfied due to packaging failure.

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Bump PyO3 to >=0.26 with matching abi3 features.
- [x] Convert `rust/Cargo.toml` into a workspace root with member crates.
- [x] Point `RustExtension`/tooling to `rust/crates/rustybt/Cargo.toml` so `pip install` and `python -m build` succeed.
- [ ] Re-run CI matrix ensuring editable installs/import checks succeed on Linux/macOS/Windows.

### Security Review

No new security issues detected; failures are limited to build tooling.

### Performance Considerations

Not evaluated; packaging must succeed before cross-platform performance checks are meaningful.

### Files Modified During Review

None (read-only QA review).

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/7.2-setup-rust-integration-pyo3.yml

### Improvements Checklist

**All Previous Issues RESOLVED:**
- [x] ✅ Bump PyO3 to >=0.26 with matching abi3 features
- [x] ✅ Convert `rust/Cargo.toml` into workspace root with member crates
- [x] ✅ Point RustExtension to `rust/crates/rustybt/Cargo.toml` (crate manifest)
- [x] ✅ Re-run CI matrix - all platforms passing
- [x] ✅ Update documentation to reference PyO3 0.26 (resolves QA-012)

**Future Enhancements (Optional, Not Blocking):**
- [ ] Consider cargo-deny for dependency auditing as Rust codebase expands
- [ ] Monitor CI build times; optimize caching if exceeds 2 minutes
- [ ] Consider Rust unit tests via wasm-bindgen-test for browser compatibility (future)
