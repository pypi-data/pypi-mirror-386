# Story X4.3: Threshold Framework and Acceptance Criteria

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** framework architect,
**I want** a clearly defined performance threshold system with statistical validation,
**so that** optimization decisions are objective and based on 95% confidence intervals with p<0.05 significance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Threshold Configuration**:
   - 5% minimum improvement threshold defined for end-to-end workflow time
   - Grid Search and Walk Forward thresholds configured separately (same 5% but different workload scales)

2. **Statistical Validation**:
   - 95% confidence interval calculation implemented (t-test, ≥10 runs)
   - Statistical significance testing (p<0.05 requirement)
   - Memory overhead threshold checking (<2% increase)

3. **Decision Framework**:
   - Accept/reject logic based on threshold evaluation
   - Rationale generation for all decisions
   - Sequential evaluation tracking (cumulative improvement, diminishing returns detection)

4. **Testing**:
   - Property-based tests (Hypothesis) for statistical calculations

### Key Technical Details from Architecture

#### Statistical Methods Required
[Source: architecture/epic-X4-performance-benchmarking-optimization.md]
- **Confidence Interval Calculation**: Use scipy.stats.t for t-distribution based CI
- **Significance Testing**: Paired t-test for before/after comparison (scipy.stats.ttest_rel)
- **Minimum Runs**: Enforce ≥10 benchmark runs for statistical validity
- **P-value Threshold**: p<0.05 for significance (95% confidence)

#### Dependencies Available
[Source: pyproject.toml]
- **structlog**: Already available in project dependencies for structured logging (line 69)

#### Threshold Values
[Source: prd/epic-X4-performance-benchmarking-optimization.md]
- **Performance Improvement**: 5% minimum for end-to-end workflow time
- **Memory Overhead**: <2% increase over baseline
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >60% for multi-tier cache (informational, not blocking)
- **Statistical Requirements**: 95% CI, p<0.05, ≥10 runs

#### Integration with Existing Models
[Source: architecture/epic-X4-performance-benchmarking-optimization.md]
The benchmarks directory already has these dataclasses from Phase 1-3:
- `PerformanceReport`: Add threshold evaluation results here
- `BenchmarkResult`: Include accept/reject decision
- `BenchmarkResultSet`: Track sequential evaluations
- `OptimizationComponent`: Link to threshold decision

#### Decision Framework Logic
[Source: prd/epic-X4-performance-benchmarking-optimization.md]
Sequential evaluation approach:
1. Validate functional equivalence FIRST (BLOCKING - must pass before performance measurement)
2. Run ≥10 benchmark iterations
3. Calculate confidence intervals and p-values
4. Apply 5% threshold for improvement
5. Check memory overhead (<2%)
6. Generate rationale for accept/reject
7. Track cumulative improvements
8. Detect diminishing returns (stop if <2% from last 2 optimizations)

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Test File Location
- Unit tests: `tests/benchmarks/test_threshold.py`
- Integration tests: Can be in same file or `tests/integration/test_threshold_integration.py`
- Property-based tests: Use Hypothesis framework with 1000+ examples

#### Test Standards
- **Coverage**: ≥95% for threshold.py module (financial-grade precision requirement)
- **Zero-Mock**: Use real statistical calculations, no mocked math functions
- **Property Testing**: Hypothesis for statistical calculation validation
- Example property test pattern:
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

@given(
    improvements=st.lists(
        st.floats(min_value=-50, max_value=100, allow_nan=False),
        min_size=10, max_size=100
    )
)
def test_confidence_interval_properties(improvements):
    """CI should contain the mean and widen with more variance."""
    ci_lower, ci_upper = calculate_confidence_interval(improvements)
    mean_improvement = np.mean(improvements)
    assert ci_lower <= mean_improvement <= ci_upper
```

#### Testing Frameworks
- pytest 7.x for test framework
- Hypothesis 6.x for property-based tests
- No mocking allowed per zero-mock enforcement
- Use real benchmark data for integration tests

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Hints**: 100% coverage with mypy --strict
- **Docstrings**: Google-style for all public methods
- **Decimal Usage**: Use Decimal type for all percentage calculations
- **Error Handling**: Specific exceptions for threshold violations
- **Logging**: structlog for structured decision logging

### Important Notes from Previous Stories
Since this is the first X4 story being created, there are no previous X4 stories. However, the existing benchmarking infrastructure from Phase 1-3 is already in place (as noted in the Epic X4 PRD status: "Phase 3 Complete (36/258 tasks, 14%)").

### Constitutional Compliance
[Source: architecture/epic-X4-performance-benchmarking-optimization.md]
- **Zero-Mock Enforcement**: All statistical calculations use real math, no synthetic results
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints with mypy --strict compliance
- **Test-Driven Development**: ≥95% coverage requirement for threshold module
- **Sprint Debug Discipline**: All decisions documented with rationale

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Complete** (2025-10-23):

Story X4.3 implemented the threshold framework and acceptance criteria for performance optimization evaluation. The existing infrastructure from Phase 1-3 already had most components in place, requiring only:

1. ✅ **Created OptimizationConfig system** (`rustybt/optimization/config.py`):
   - Default configuration: 5% improvement, 95% confidence, 10 runs, 3x memory limit
   - Strict configuration: 10% improvement, 99% confidence, 20 runs, 2x memory limit
   - Lenient configuration: 2% improvement, 90% confidence, 10 runs, 5x memory limit
   - Centralized threshold management with workflow/dataset size configurations

2. ✅ **Enhanced methodology documentation** (`docs/internal/benchmarks/methodology.md`):
   - Added detailed OptimizationConfig usage examples
   - Documented configuration presets (Default, Strict, Lenient)
   - Explained statistical validation methods (t-test, CI, p-values)
   - Added decision framework criteria (ALL must be met for acceptance)

3. ✅ **Comprehensive test suite** (`tests/benchmarks/test_threshold.py`, 35 tests, all passing):
   - Threshold creation and validation tests
   - Statistical evaluation tests (insufficient samples, significant improvement, memory overhead)
   - OptimizationConfig tests (default/strict/lenient configs, threshold management)
   - Property-based tests with Hypothesis (speedup calculations, CI invariants, p-value ranges)
   - Integration scenarios:
     - ✅ 12% improvement → ACCEPTED
     - ✅ 3% improvement → REJECTED
     - ✅ 15% improvement with 4x memory → REJECTED (memory overhead)
     - ✅ Exactly 5% improvement → ACCEPTED (edge case)
     - ✅ Diminishing returns detection (2 consecutive rejections)

**Key Technical Details**:

Statistical validation includes:
- Mean improvement calculation: `improvement% = ((baseline - optimized) / baseline) × 100`
- Two-sample t-test for significance (scipy.stats.ttest_ind, one-tailed)
- 95% confidence intervals for both baseline and optimized
- Memory overhead validation: `ratio = optimized_memory / baseline_memory ≤ max_multiplier`

Decision criteria (ALL must pass for ACCEPTANCE):
1. Improvement ≥ minimum threshold (e.g., 5%)
2. Statistically significant (p < α, typically p<0.05)
3. Memory overhead ≤ maximum multiplier (e.g., 3x)
4. Sample size ≥ minimum required (10 runs)

**Infrastructure Already in Place** (from Phase 1-3):
- `PerformanceThreshold` dataclass with validation
- `evaluate_threshold()` function with comprehensive statistical analysis
- `BenchmarkResultSet` with statistical properties (mean, std, CI)
- `OptimizationComponent` with speedup calculations
- `PerformanceReport` with sequential evaluation support
- Integration with `sequential.py` for automated evaluation workflows

**QA Fixes Applied** (2025-10-23):

Following QA review, corrected two misalignments with story ACs and architecture:

1. **AC-MEM-001 (HIGH)**: Memory threshold alignment
   - Changed from 3x multiplier to <2% increase per AC requirements
   - Updated `PerformanceThreshold.max_memory_overhead_multiplier` → `max_memory_increase_percent`
   - Changed calculation: `(optimized - baseline) / baseline * 100` instead of ratio
   - Updated default configs: 2% (default), 1% (strict), 10% (lenient)
   - All 35 tests updated and passing

2. **STAT-TEST-001 (MEDIUM)**: Statistical test method alignment
   - Switched from two-sample t-test (`ttest_ind`) to paired t-test (`ttest_rel`)
   - Added equal sample size validation for paired testing
   - Updated property-based tests to generate equal-sized samples
   - Aligns with architecture requirement for before/after paired measurements

3. **DOC-DRIFT-001 (LOW)**: Documentation terminology unification
   - Updated methodology.md to use consistent percentage-based memory terminology
   - Fixed lenient config description (was "5x overhead", now "10% increase")
   - Fixed lenient sample size (was "5 runs", now "10 runs")
   - Changed "Memory Overhead Validation" → "Memory Increase Validation"
   - Removed all "multiplier" and "ratio" references in favor of "percentage increase"

## QA Results
### Review Date: 2025-10-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Solid implementation and test coverage appear in place; however, 2 critical misalignments against story/architecture requirements were found: (1) Memory overhead threshold is implemented as a 3x multiplier (and tests assert 4x rejection) while ACs require <2% increase; (2) Statistical test uses two-sample t-test (ttest_ind, one-tailed) whereas the architecture specifies paired t-test (ttest_rel) for before/after runs. These discrepancies undermine acceptance criteria conformance and decision rigor.

### Refactoring Performed

None during QA review (advisory changes only).

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (no violations observed in reviewed surfaces)
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (property-based + integration present)
- All ACs Met: ✗ (memory threshold <2% not enforced; paired t-test not used)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Align memory overhead criterion with ACs: enforce <2% increase (not 3x multiplier); update OptimizationConfig defaults, threshold docs, and tests accordingly
- [ ] Switch statistical significance test to paired t-test (scipy.stats.ttest_rel) per architecture; re-verify p-value logic (tail and alpha)
- [ ] Reconcile documentation (methodology.md) with story ACs and architecture for CI/ttest semantics; ensure one source of truth
- [ ] Confirm Decimal is used end-to-end for percentages where required by standards

### Security Review

No security risks identified for this change scope.

### Performance Considerations

Decision framework and CI/p-value rationale are appropriate once paired testing and memory threshold alignment are corrected; current 3x memory allowance could mask regressions.

### Files Modified During Review

None (advisory only). Developer to update File List if making the above corrections.

### Gate Status

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required — address checklist items above, then request re-review

### Review Date: 2025-10-23 (Rerun)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Re-review confirms fixes applied: memory constraint now enforces <2% increase using percentage semantics, and significance testing uses paired t-test (ttest_rel, one-tailed). Tests updated and reported passing (35/35). Implementation aligns with architecture and ACs.

### Refactoring Performed

None during QA review.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓

### Review Date: 2025-10-23 (Fresh Review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Comprehensive re-evaluation confirms production-ready implementation. All acceptance criteria fully met with robust test coverage (35/35 tests passing including property-based and integration tests). Implementation demonstrates excellent engineering practices:

**Statistical Rigor**: Paired t-test correctly implemented for before/after comparisons (scipy.stats.ttest_rel), 95% CI calculations, p-value validation (p<0.05 default), and minimum 10 sample size enforcement.

**Configuration Architecture**: OptimizationConfig provides flexible threshold management with three well-designed presets (Default, Strict, Lenient) covering production, validation, and experimentation scenarios. Clear separation between workflow types (grid_search, walk_forward, single_backtest) and dataset sizes.

**Type Safety & Precision**: Complete type hints throughout, Decimal precision for all financial calculations, frozen dataclasses for immutability. Constitutional requirements (CR-001, CR-002, CR-004, CR-005) fully satisfied.

**Test Coverage Excellence**:
- 9 threshold creation/validation tests
- 8 core evaluation tests
- 9 configuration system tests
- 4 property-based tests (Hypothesis framework)
- 5 integration scenario tests covering acceptance, rejection, memory overflow, edge cases, and diminishing returns

Documentation (methodology.md) is consistent with implementation using correct percentage-based memory terminology throughout.

### Refactoring Performed

None required. Code quality already meets production standards.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (Google-style docstrings, type hints 100%, Decimal precision)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Proper module organization in rustybt/benchmarks/ and rustybt/optimization/)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Property-based + integration + unit tests, zero-mock enforcement)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (See detailed validation below)

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

**AC 1: Threshold Configuration** ✅
- 5% minimum improvement threshold defined (OptimizationConfig.create_default())
- Grid Search and Walk Forward thresholds configured separately with workflow-specific settings
- Multiple dataset size categories supported (small, medium, large, production)

**AC 2: Statistical Validation** ✅
- 95% confidence interval calculation implemented using scipy.stats (z-score and t-distribution)
- Statistical significance testing via paired t-test (ttest_rel, one-tailed, p<0.05)
- Memory increase threshold checking (<2% default, percentage-based calculation)
- Minimum 10 runs enforced via InsufficientDataError

**AC 3: Decision Framework** ✅
- Accept/reject logic in evaluate_threshold() with ALL criteria evaluation
- Rationale generation via _generate_decision_rationale() for all outcomes
- Sequential evaluation tracking in PerformanceReport.should_continue_evaluation()
- Diminishing returns detection (stops after 2 consecutive rejections)
- Cumulative improvement tracking with 40% goal

**AC 4: Testing** ✅
- Property-based tests using Hypothesis (4 tests covering calculation invariants)
- Positive test: test_scenario_grid_search_optimization_accepted (12% improvement → ACCEPTED)
- Negative test: test_scenario_grid_search_optimization_rejected (3% improvement → REJECTED)
- Additional edge cases: exact threshold, memory overflow, diminishing returns

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Statistical calculations use well-established scipy library. No user input directly processed without validation (PerformanceThreshold.__post_init__ validates parameters).

### Performance Considerations

Threshold evaluation is lightweight (statistical calculations on aggregated metrics). Property-based tests demonstrate stable performance across varied input ranges. Sequential evaluation includes early stopping for efficiency (goal achievement or diminishing returns).

### Files Modified During Review

None (advisory only).

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/internal/qa/gates/X4.3-threshold-framework-acceptance-criteria.yml

### Recommended Status

✅ **Ready for Done** - Production-ready implementation with comprehensive test coverage and full acceptance criteria satisfaction.
