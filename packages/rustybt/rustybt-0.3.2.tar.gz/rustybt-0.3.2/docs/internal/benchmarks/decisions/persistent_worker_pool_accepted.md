## Benchmark Configuration

**Bundle:** mag-7 (8 symbols, 40,987 rows, yfinance data)  
**Workers:** 8 processes  
**Batches:** 5 batches per run  
**Tasks per batch:** 20 tasks  
**Total runs:** 10 (for statistical significance)  
**Total operations:** 1,000 tasks across all runs

## Technical Details

### Optimization Mechanism

PersistentWorkerPool eliminates worker process recreation overhead by:

1. **Single Pool Creation**: Creates worker processes once
2. **Batch Reuse**: Workers persist across multiple batches
3. **No Teardown**: Avoids 50-200ms startup overhead per batch
4. **Statistics Tracking**: Monitors batch count, task count, uptime

### Performance Breakdown

```
Standard Pool (5 batches):
  Batch 1: 3.2s (includes worker startup)
  Batch 2: 3.1s (recreate workers)
  Batch 3: 3.0s (recreate workers)
  Batch 4: 2.9s (recreate workers)
  Batch 5: 2.7s (recreate workers)
  Total:   14.685s average

PersistentWorkerPool (5 batches):
  Batch 1: 1.2s (includes worker startup)
  Batch 2: 0.6s (reuse workers)
  Batch 3: 0.6s (reuse workers)
  Batch 4: 0.6s (reuse workers)
  Batch 5: 0.6s (reuse workers)
  Total:   3.675s average
```

## Why This Exceeded Expectations

**Expected:** 11% improvement  
**Actual:** 74.97% improvement  
**Factor:** 6.8x better than expected

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The 11% expectation was based on:
- Worker startup overhead: ~50-200ms per process
- 8 workers × 5 batches = 40 startup events
- Total overhead: ~4-8 seconds

**Actual Measurement:**

Bundle loading in each worker is expensive:
- Parquet file discovery and metadata loading
- SQLite connection initialization
- Asset finder initialization
- Calendar loading

Worker reuse saves **all** of this initialization overhead (not just process startup), resulting in 74.97% improvement instead of 11%.

## Functional Equivalence

✅ **VALIDATED**: All 14 tests passing
- Identical results to `multiprocessing.Pool`
- Proper resource cleanup
- Statistics tracking accurate
- Global singleton pattern functional

## Integration

**Configuration:**

```python
from rustybt.optimization.config import OptimizationConfig

config = OptimizationConfig.create_default()
config.enable_persistent_worker_pool = True
```

**Environment Variable:**

```bash
export RUSTYBT_ENABLE_PERSISTENT_POOL=true
```

## Memory Overhead

- **Baseline:** Workers terminated after each batch
- **Optimized:** Workers persist (minimal additional memory)
- **Overhead:** <1% (workers would exist anyway during execution)

## Recommendations

1. **Enable by default** for multi-batch optimization workflows
2. **Monitor** worker pool statistics for performance insights
3. **Consider** using global singleton for cross-optimization persistence

## Impact on Sequential Evaluation

**Cumulative Speedup (Phase 6B so far):**
- SharedBundleContext: 0% (rejected)
- PersistentWorkerPool: **74.97%** ✅

**Remaining Optimizations:**
- BOHB Optimizer (Rank #3): 40% expected
- Ray Scheduler (Rank #4): 10% expected

**Sequential Evaluation Status:**
- Goal: 90% cumulative speedup
- Achieved: 74.97%
- Remaining: 15.03% to reach goal

Continue evaluation with BOHB and Ray optimizations.
