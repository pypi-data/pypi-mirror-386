## Why This Documentation Was Archived

This directory contains the original Epic 10 documentation (Stories 10.1, 10.2, 10.3) that was archived during the Epic 11 complete documentation redo.

### Timeline of Events

1. **Epic 10 Initial Completion** (Oct 2024)
   - Stories 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 marked "Complete"
   - 90%+ API coverage achieved
   - Appeared to meet acceptance criteria

2. **First Quality Issue** (Oct 14, 2025)
   - User discovered fabricated order types (TWAP, VWAP, Iceberg)
   - Story 10.X1 remediation removed 157 fabricated/incorrect API references
   - Achieved 100% API import verification

3. **Systemic Quality Issues Discovered** (Oct 15, 2025)
   - User reported: "Incorrect framework API usage, nonfunctional code examples, fake references"
   - Root cause: Documentation created by syntax inference, not framework expertise
   - Decision: Complete redo required with comprehensive quality framework

### Issues Found in This Documentation

**Primary Issues**:
1. **Incorrect API Usage Patterns** - APIs exist but usage shown is wrong
2. **Nonfunctional Code Examples** - Examples don't execute correctly
3. **Syntax Inference** - Documentation created without actual framework usage
4. **Inadequate Validation** - Only checked if APIs can be imported, not if examples work

**Known Specific Issues**:
- Story 10.2: Fabricated TWAP, VWAP, Iceberg order types (removed in Story 10.X1)
- Multiple files: Incorrect import paths (fixed in Story 10.X1)
- Unknown count: Incorrect usage patterns, non-functional examples (NOT fixed)

### What This Archive Contains

This archive contains:
- API documentation from `docs/api/` (Epic 10 generated content)
- Related documentation files from Epic 10 stories
- Structure and organization (for reference)

**What This Archive Does NOT Contain**:
- Internal documentation (moved to `docs/internal/`)
- Guides and getting-started content (preserved in main docs)
- Examples (consolidated into `docs/examples/`)

### How to Use This Archive

**✅ DO Use For**:
- Understanding structure and organization approaches
- Learning what NOT to do (quality issues to avoid)
- Reference for comparing old vs new documentation
- Historical context for Epic 11 decisions

**❌ DO NOT Use For**:
- Copying content to new documentation (has quality issues)
- Production documentation reference (superseded by Epic 11)
- Code examples (likely non-functional)
- API usage patterns (likely incorrect)

### The Replacement: Epic 11

Epic 10 has been completely redone as **Epic 11: Documentation Quality Framework & Epic 10 Complete Redo**.

**Epic 11 Improvements**:
- Comprehensive quality framework (standards, checklists, automation)
- Automated example execution testing (100% pass required)
- Framework expert review (mandatory for all stories)
- Production-grade quality standards
- Documentation created by framework experts, not syntax inference

**Epic 11 Documentation Location**: `docs/api/` (same location, new content)

**Epic 11 Details**: See `docs/prd/epic-11-documentation-quality-framework-and-epic10-redo.md`

## Lessons Learned from Epic 10

### What Went Wrong

1. **Insufficient Quality Standards**
   - No requirement for framework expertise
   - No automated example execution testing
   - No mandatory expert review
   - Acceptance criteria focused on coverage, not correctness

2. **Documentation Creation Process**
   - Documentation created by syntax inference
   - Examples not tested before documenting
   - No validation of usage patterns
   - "Manual review" was insufficient

3. **Validation Gaps**
   - Story 10.X1 only checked API imports, not usage
   - No automated testing of example execution
   - No framework expert validation
   - Quality debt accumulated

### What Epic 11 Does Differently

1. **Comprehensive Quality Framework**
   - Quality standards document (DOCUMENTATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md)
   - Pre-flight checklist (before starting work)
   - Validation checklist (before completion)
   - Automated example execution testing
   - Mandatory framework expert review

2. **Documentation Creation Process**
   - Framework expertise required
   - Test examples BEFORE documenting
   - Validate usage patterns against production code
   - Continuous quality validation

3. **Multi-Level Validation**
   - Automated API import verification (from Story 10.X1)
   - Automated example execution testing (NEW)
   - Usage pattern validation (expert review)
   - Comprehensive quality checklists
   - Zero known issues at completion
