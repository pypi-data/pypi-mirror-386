## üîß **Source Code Reference**

For implementation details, refer to the actual broker adapter source code:

### Broker Adapters

Located in `rustybt/live/brokers/`:

- `paper_broker.py` - Simulated broker for testing
- `binance_adapter.py` - Binance exchange integration
- `bybit_adapter.py` - Bybit exchange integration
- `hyperliquid_adapter.py` - Hyperliquid DEX integration
- `ib_adapter.py` - Interactive Brokers integration
- `ccxt_adapter.py` - Generic CCXT exchange wrapper

### Safety Systems

Located in `rustybt/live/`:

- `engine.py` - Live trading engine with built-in safety controls
- `reconciler.py` - Position reconciliation with broker
- `state_manager.py` - State persistence and recovery
- `scheduler.py` - Market-aware scheduling

### Circuit Breakers & Risk Controls

The live trading engine includes built-in safety mechanisms:

```python
from rustybt.live.engine import LiveTradingEngine

# Circuit breakers are configured in the engine
engine = LiveTradingEngine(
    strategy=my_strategy,
    broker=broker,
    max_daily_loss=Decimal("1000"),      # Daily loss limit
    max_position_value=Decimal("50000"),  # Per-position limit
    max_total_exposure=Decimal("100000"), # Total exposure limit
)
```

**See `rustybt/live/engine.py` source code for complete implementation details.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Notice**

Live trading involves real financial risk. Always:

1. ‚úÖ Test thoroughly with PaperBroker first
2. ‚úÖ Start with small position sizes
3. ‚úÖ Configure appropriate circuit breakers and limits
4. ‚úÖ Monitor positions and P&L actively
5. ‚úÖ Have emergency shutdown procedures in place
6. ‚úÖ Review the [Production Checklist](../../guides/production-checklist.md) before going live

**Never deploy to production without comprehensive testing and risk controls.**
