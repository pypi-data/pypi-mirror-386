  Coinbase Advanced Trading fees (formerly Coinbase Pro).

  Key features:
  - Maker/taker pricing model
  - Volume tiers based on trailing 30-day volume
  - Maker fees decrease faster than taker fees
  - High-volume traders can get maker rebates

  Examples (Tier 0 - < $10k volume):
  - Market buy 0.5 BTC @ $30,000:
    Trade value = $15,000
    Commission = $15,000 × 0.006 = $90.00 (taker)

  - Limit sell 10 ETH @ $2,000 (order rests):
    Trade value = $20,000
    Commission = $20,000 × 0.006 = $120.00 (maker)

  Examples (Tier 4 - $1M+ volume):
  - Market buy 1 BTC @ $30,000:
    Commission = $30,000 × 0.0025 = $75.00 (taker)

  - Limit buy 15 ETH @ $2,000 (order rests):
    Commission = $30,000 × 0.001 = $30.00 (maker)
