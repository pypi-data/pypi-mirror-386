# OptHub Runner

![Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,aws,graphql,docker,vscode,github)

Opthub Runner is a Python package that provides the following two features:

- Evaluator\*: Feature to evaluate user-submitted solutions on Opthub using Docker Image.
- Scorer\*: Feature to calculate scores from a series of evaluations using Docker Image.

Please refer to 4.Á´∂ÊäÄ„ÅÆÁ¢∫Ë™ç in [OptHub Tutorial](https://opthub.notion.site/OptHub-1b96e2f4e9424db0934f297ee0351403) for detailed explanations of the Evaluator and Scorer.

This repository describes how to install and run Opthub Runner.

## Getting Started

### Recommended Environment

We recommend using the following environments:

- [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
- [GCP Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute).
- [Sakura Cloud](https://www.sakura.ad.jp/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmOm3BhC8ARIsAOSbapUD6m2okjosfvKuZvb91rdY4lmgMOZeFtMr2eTZqQLTCrw5naQCE0saAtzWEALw_wcB).
- Any other environment that supports Docker and can run continuously.

### Prerequisites

- Install Python 3.10 or newer.
- Set up pip for package management.
- Install and start Docker.*

\*For Mac users, you can install and start [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

### 1. Installation

Install `opthub-runner-admin` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install opthub-runner-admin
```

### 2. Configuring YAML File

Create a YAML file with the options needed to run the Evaluator and Scorer, based on [config.default.yml](https://github.com/opthub-org/opthub-runner-admin/blob/main/config.default.yml). For details on the options to set in the file, please refer to [YAML File Options](#yaml-file-options).

### 3. Starting the Evaluator/Scorer

At first, start Docker. **Please note that Docker must remain running while the Evaluator/Scorer is active.**

Then, run the Evaluator/Scorer using the following command. Replace `<evaluator|scorer>` with either `evaluator` or `scorer`. For `--config`, specify the path to the YAML file you created in [2. Configuring YAML File](#2-configuring-yaml-file). If not specified, the `config.yml` in the current directory will be used.

```bash
opthub-runner <evaluator|scorer> --config <yaml file path>
```

You will be prompted to enter the username and password. These must be the ones of the competition administrator.

```bash
Username: (your username)
Password: (your password)
```

**Please note that the Evaluator/Scorer must remain running during the competition.** If you have any other issues, please refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## YAML File Options

The following table lists the options to include in the YAML file, along with their type, default values, and descriptions. Please confirm the default values for the following options with the OptHub representative. Contact information is [here](#contact).

- evaluator_queue_url
- scorer_queue_url

| rm | bool | True | Whether to remove the Docker container after evaluation and score calculation. True is recommended except for debugging. If set to False, the Docker containers created during evaluation and scoring will not be removed, accumulating over time. |
| log_level | [DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL] | INFO | Log level to output. |
| force | bool | False | Whether to forcibly create a new flag file. |
| evaluator_queue_url | path | - | Amazon SQS queue URL used by the Evaluator. |

## Troubleshooting

### Docker is Not Running

The following error occurs when Docker is not running.

```plaintext
Error: Unable to communicate with Docker. Please ensure Docker is running and accessible. (Error while fetching server API version: ('Connection aborted.', FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')))
```

For Mac, you can resolve this issue by starting Docker Desktop. You can install Docker Desktop [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

For Ubuntu, you can resolve this issue by installing Docker via the terminal with the following command.

```plaintext
sudo apt install docker.io
```

### No Permission to Access Docker Socket

The following error occurs when the current user does not have permission to access the Docker socket.

```plaintext
Error: Unable to communicate with Docker. Please ensure Docker is running and accessible. (Error while fetching server API version: ('Connection aborted.', PermissionError(13, 'Permission denied')))
```

For Ubuntu, you can resolve this issue by adding the user to the Docker group and then logging in again. Specifically, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command in the terminal:

    ```plaintext
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

2. Either log in again or run the following command in the terminal:

    ```plaintext
    newgrp docker
    ```

### Not Logged in with Competition Administrator Account

The following error occurs if you did not log in with the competition administrator account when starting the Evaluator/Scorer.

```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ÔΩ•ÔΩ•ÔΩ•
opthub_runner_admin.models.exception.DockerImageNotFoundError: Cannot access the Docker image. Please check your permissions. If you're not authenticated using the competition administrator's account, please do so.
```

You can resolve this issue by logging in with the competition administrator‚Äôs account when starting the Evaluator/Scorer. When the following prompt appears, enter the administrator‚Äôs username and password.

```plaintext
Note: Make sure to authenticate using the competition administrator's account.
Username: (The administrator's username)
Password: (The administrator's password)
```

```

Please check the AWS Access Key ID set in `config.yml` and enter the correct value.

### Incorrect AWS Secret Access Key

The following error occurs when the AWS Secret Access Key (`secret_access_key`) set in `config.yml` is incorrect.

```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ÔΩ•ÔΩ•ÔΩ•
botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (SignatureDoesNotMatch) when calling the ReceiveMessage operation: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your AWS Secret Access Key and signing method. Consult the service documentation for details.

```

Please check the AWS Secret Access Key set in `config.yml` and enter the correct value.

### Incorrect SQS Queue Name

The following error occurs when the SQS queue name (`evaluator_queue_name` / `scorer_queue_name`) set in `config.yml` is incorrect.

```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ÔΩ•ÔΩ•ÔΩ•
botocore.errorfactory.QueueDoesNotExist: An error occurred (AWS.SimpleQueueService.NonExistentQueue) when calling the ReceiveMessage operation: The specified queue does not exist.
```

Please check the SQS queue name set in `config.yml` and enter the correct value.

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  ÔΩ•ÔΩ•ÔΩ•
botocore.exceptions.EndpointConnectionError: Could not connect to the endpoint URL: "https://sqs.ap-northeas-1.amazonaws.com/"
```

Please check the AWS Default Region Name set in `config.yml` and enter the correct value.

### Error Inside the Docker Container

The following error is displayed when an error occurs inside the Docker container.

```plaintext
ERROR:opthub_runner_admin.evaluator.main:Error occurred while evaluating solution.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/opthub/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/opthub_runner_admin/evaluator/main.py", line 125, in evaluate
    evaluation_result = execute_in_docker(
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/home/opthub/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/opthub_runner_admin/lib/docker_executor.py", line 88, in execute_in_docker
    raise RuntimeError(msg)
RuntimeError: Failed to parse stdout.
```

To investigate this error in detail, you need to check the Docker container logs. Modify the `rm` setting in `config.yml` to `False`, then restart the Evaluator/Scorer and, after execution, check the logs of the container. You can view the Docker container logs with the following command:

```bash
$ docker ps # Check Container ID
$ docker logs <Container ID> # View logs
```

Check the logs and modify the Docker image to ensure the Docker container output is in the correct format.

Additionally, the following container log shows an error that occurs when the built Docker image is run on an incompatible platform.

```plaintext
exec /usr/bin/sh: exec format error
```

To ensure compatibility, either match the environment used to build the Docker image with the environment used to run the Evaluator/Scorer, or use `buildx` to create a compatible Docker image.
