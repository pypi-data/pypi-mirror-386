`DECIPHER` aims to learn cells’ disentangled intracellular molecular identity embedding and extracellular spatial context embedding from spatial omics data.

Please check our paper *DECIPHER for learning disentangled cellular embeddings in large-scale heterogeneous spatial omics data* on [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63140-8).

## Installation

### PyPI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires Python >= 3.10, install with CUDA-enabled GPU is recommended.

We recommend to install `cell-decipher` to a new conda environment:

```sh
mamba create -n decipher python==3.11 -c conda-forge -y && conda activate decipher
pip install cell-decipher
install_pyg_dependencies
```

(Optional) You can install [RAPIDS](https://docs.rapids.ai/install) to accelerate visualization.

```sh
mamba create -n decipher -c conda-forge -c rapidsai -c nvidia python=3.11 rapids=25.06 'cuda-version>=12.0,<=12.8' -y && conda activate decipher
pip install cell-decipher
install_pyg_dependencies
```

### Docker

Build docker image from [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) or pull image from Docker Hub directly:

```sh
docker pull huhansan666666/decipher:latest
docker run --gpus all -it --rm huhansan666666/decipher:latest
```

## Documentation

### Minimal example
Here is a minimal example for quick start:

```python
import scanpy as sc
from decipher import DECIPHER
from decipher.utils import scanpy_viz

# Init model
model = DECIPHER(work_dir='/path/to/work_dir')

# Register data (adata.X is raw counts, adata.obsm['spatial'] is spatial coordinates)
adata = sc.read_h5ad('/path/to/adata.h5ad')
model.register_data(adata)

# Fit DECIPHER model
model.fit_omics()

# Clustering disentangled embeddings
adata.obsm['X_center'] = model.center_emb  # intracellular molecular embedding
adata.obsm['X_nbr'] =  model.nbr_emb  # spatial context embedding
adata = scanpy_viz(adata, ['center', 'nbr'], rapids=False)

# Plot
adata.obsm['X_umap'] = adata.obsm['X_umap_center'].copy()
sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['cell_type'])
adata.obsm['X_umap'] = adata.obsm['X_umap_nbr'].copy()
sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['region'])
```

## FAQ
> Please open a new [github issue](https://github.com/gao-lab/DECIPHER/issues/new/choose) if you meet problem.

1. Visium or ST data

DECIPHER is designed for single cell resolution data. As for Visium or ST, you can still use DECIPHER after obtaining single-cell resolution through deconvolution or spatial mapping strategies.

<!-- 2. `CUDA out of memory` error

The `model.train_gene_select()` may need a lot GPU memory. For example, it needs ~40G GPU memory in [Identify Localization-related LRs](./docs/tutorials/3-select_LRs.ipynb) tutorial (with ~700k cells and 1k LRs). If your GPU device do not have enough memory, you still can train model on GPU but set `disable_gpu=True` in `model.train_gene_select()`. -->
