System Architecture
===================

This section describes the system architecture in detail.

Core Components
---------------

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Data Layer**

   - Handles all data persistence
   - Implements caching mechanisms
   - Provides data validation

2. **Business Logic Layer**

   - Processes business rules
   - Manages workflows
   - Orchestrates data operations

3. **Presentation Layer**

   - Renders user interfaces
   - Handles user interactions
   - Manages client-side state

Design Patterns
---------------

The architecture follows several well-established design patterns:

**Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
   Separates concerns between data, presentation, and control logic.

**Repository Pattern**
   Provides an abstraction layer over data access.

**Dependency Injection**
   Promotes loose coupling and testability.

Scalability Considerations
---------------------------

.. important::

   The architecture is designed to scale horizontally. Each component
   can be deployed independently and scaled based on load.

.. note::

   For high-traffic scenarios, consider implementing:

   - Load balancing across multiple instances
   - Distributed caching with Redis
   - Message queues for asynchronous processing
