    overview: |
      This module contains fundamental physics equations including Einstein's
      mass-energy equivalence, Maxwell's equations, and Schr√∂dinger equation.

      The equations are included from external LaTeX files and rendered using
      Sphinx's math directive.

    latex_includes: "equations.tex"

    notes: |
      .. note::

         These equations require a LaTeX engine for proper rendering.
         Sphinx uses MathJax by default for HTML output.

      .. tip::

         To render these in PDF output, ensure you have a working LaTeX
         installation with the necessary packages.

    overview: |
      This module contains fundamental calculus formulas including the
      fundamental theorem of calculus, integration techniques, and
      series expansions.

    notes: |
      .. important::

         LaTeX files should contain only the mathematical content, not
         the full document structure. Document preambles (\\documentclass,
         \\usepackage, etc.) are automatically stripped.
