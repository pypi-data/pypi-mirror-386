overview: |
  Get up and running with Introligo in minutes. This guide covers installation,
  basic usage, and your first documentation project.

  Introligo streamlines the documentation process by converting structured YAML
  configurations into properly formatted reStructuredText files for Sphinx. It supports
  hierarchical page organization, automatic toctree generation, and rich content features
  including code examples, API documentation, and custom sections.

  The tool is designed to work seamlessly with Sphinx's autodoc extension, making it
  perfect for documenting Python projects with complex module structures. It automatically
  handles the creation of directory hierarchies, cross-references, and navigation structures.
