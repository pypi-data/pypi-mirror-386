  Gene Ontology Causal Activity Model (GO-CAM) Schema.
  
  This schema provides a way of representing causal pathway [Models](Model.md). A model consists of a set of
  [Activity](Activity.md) objects, where each activity object represents the function of either an [individual
  gene product](EnabledByGeneProductAssociation), a [protein complex of gene products](EnabledByGeneProductAssociation),
  or a set of possible gene products.
  
  Each [Models](Model.md) has associated metadata slots. Some slots such as [id](id.md), [title](title.md),
  and [status](status.md) are *required*.

          - In the context of the GO workflow, the allowed values for this field come from the GPI file
              from an authoritative source. For example, the authoritative source for human is the EBI GOA
              group, and the GPI for this group consists of UniProtKB IDs (for proteins) and RNA Central
              IDs (for RNA gene products)
          - A gene identifier may be provided as a value here (if the authoritative GPI allows it). Note
              that the *interpretation* of the gene ID in the context of a GO-CAM model is the (spliceform
              and proteoform agnostic) *product* of that gene.

  EnabledByProteinComplexAssociation:

    comments:
      - Protein complexes can be specified either by *pre-composition* or *post-composition*. For pre-composition,
          a species-specific named protein complex (such as an entry in ComplexPortal) can be specified, in
          which case the value of `members` is *implicit*. For post-composition, the placeholder term "GO:0032991"
          can be used, in which case `members` must be *explicitly* specified. An intermediate case is when
          a named class in GO that is a subclass of "GO:0032991" is used. In this case, `members` should still
          be specified, as this may only be partially specified by the GO class.
