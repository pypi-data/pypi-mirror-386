    represent everything from "pins" of a component, to the "virtual" pins of a
    circuit, to the abstract ports that make up a pin-assignment problem.

    Ports can only be netted to other ports of the same concrete type, thus a
    subclass of Port can only be netted to the same subclass of port. For
    parameterized ports, they also need to match the same parameters.  To create
    a multi-signal port, create a subclass of Port with a member field for each
    signal. These are sometimes also referred to as "bundle" ports.

    Instantiating Port directly represents a single electrical signal, and is
    the only type that is allowed as a leaf in a complex Port structure.

    Ports can be netted together using the `+` operator. This will create a
    :py:class:`~jitx.net.Net` object that represents the netted ports. If the
    ports should be part of a signal topology where the order of the ports
    matters, use the `>>` operator. This will create a
    :py:class:`~jitx.net.TopologyNet` object that represents the netted ports
    that will only allow the ports to be connected in this particular order
    while routing. Note that you must use a topology net even if there is only
    two ports in the net if you wish to apply a signal integrity constraint.
