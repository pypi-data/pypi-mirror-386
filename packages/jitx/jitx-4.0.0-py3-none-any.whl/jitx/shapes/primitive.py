"""
The primitive shape set provides the basis for all shapes in JITX. If a library
is used to create geometry, a :py:class:`~jitx.shapes.ShapeGeometry` interface
should be implemented in order provide a mapping of the library geometry to one
of these primitive shapes. Notably, a shapely ShapeGeometry interface has
already been provided, to seamlessly use the shapely library to generate
geometry for your design.
