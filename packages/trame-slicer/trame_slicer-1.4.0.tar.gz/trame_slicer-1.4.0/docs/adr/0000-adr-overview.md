# Architectural Decision Records (ADR) Overview

The docs/adr folder lists the architecture decisions records taken when creating
trame-slicer. These ADR list the main architecture decisions, why they were
made, what could change the decision and a log tracking of which decisions came
before this one to avoid repeating the same patterns if they were proven less
effective in the past.

## ADR template

- **Title**: A short, descriptive name for the decision.
- **Context**: The problem being solved or constraints affecting the decision.
- **Decision**: What was chosen and why.
- **Consequences**: The impact of the decision on the system, including
  trade-offs.
