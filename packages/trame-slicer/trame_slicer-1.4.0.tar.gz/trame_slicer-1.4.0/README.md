# trame-slicer

![Welcome to trame-slicer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KitwareMedical/trame-slicer/main/docs/trame-slicer-medical-app-example.png)

trame-slicer is a Python library bringing
[3DSlicer](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/) components in trame as a
composable library.

It uses 3D Slicer\'s python wrapping and adds a thin wrapping to make it
available with the [trame framework](https://github.com/Kitware/trame/).

## Warning

As the 3D Slicer Python wheel is not yet generated by the 3D Slicer CI, manually
generated wheels are provided for Python 3.10 for Windows and Linux WSL.

The API has not been stabilized / reviewed by the 3D Slicer core developers so
please use this library with caution.

## Downloading the latest wheels

Links to the latest VTK MRML wheels necessary to use this library in a Python
environment can be downloaded here:

- [Windows](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/trame-slicer/releases/download/v1.4.0.wheels/vtk_mrml-9.4.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl)
- [Linux](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/trame-slicer/releases/download/v1.4.0.wheels/vtk_mrml-9.4.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_35_x86_64.whl)

To use the library with other platforms (and Python 3.12), you can use the
[Slicer Trame module](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerTrame) directly
available in the Slicer 5.9+ extension manager.

## Installing

The library can be installed as follows :

- Setup a Python 3.10 environment
- Activate your environment
- From PyPI
  - Use `pip install trame-slicer` to install the latest release
- From GitHub
  - Git clone the library
  - cd into the library
  - Use the `pip install -e .` command to install the library along it\'s
    dependencies
- Copy the vtk_mrml wheel file matching your OS (see
  [Downloading the latest wheels](#Downloading-the-latest-wheels))
  - Windows: `pip install vtk_mrml-9.4.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl`
  - Linux: `pip install vtk_mrml-9.4.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_35_x86_64.whl`

## Getting started

To get started using trame, please have a look at the
[introductory trame course](https://kitware.github.io/trame/guide/intro/course.html).

To start using the trame-slicer library, have a look and run the
[medical viewer app](examples/medical_viewer_app.py)

## Features

The following subset of 3D Slicer features are currently supported :

- (limited) file loading
- Volume files (DCM, NRRD, NIFTI, \...)
- Model files (STL, OBJ)
- MRML / MRB files
- Segmentations (NRRD, NIFTI, \...)
- **Display**
  - 2D/3D with 3D Slicer UI manipulation
  - Volume Rendering preset / shift
- Bare bone access to 3D Slicer MRML scene and Core logic components

## Work in progress

To make it easier for users to use trame-slicer, the following work are in
progress :

- Slicer wheel generation merge into 3D Slicer\'s preview release
- CI changes to build the Slicer wheel along 3D Slicer\'s release
- 3D Slicer extension to install trame-slicer and launch a trame-slicer server
  directly from 3D Slicer

## Troubleshooting

If you get the following error on Linux:

`ImportError: cannot import name 'vtkMRMLDisplayableNode' from 'slicer' (XXX/lib/python3.10/site-packages/slicer/__init__.py)`

You might be using a statically compiled Python. Please switch to a shared
version of Python.
