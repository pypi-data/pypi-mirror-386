Software Heritage - graph service
=================================

Tooling and services, collectively known as ``swh-graph``, providing fast
access to the graph representation of the `Software Heritage
<https://www.softwareheritage.org/>`_
`archive <https://archive.softwareheritage.org/>`_.  The service is in-memory,
based on a compressed representation of the Software Heritage Merkle DAG.
