    """1-D discrete Fréchet distance matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    profiles1 : tuple of (N1, M1) ndarray and (N1,) ndarray of int
        Function curves and their lengths of supports.
    profiles2 : tuple of (N2, M2) ndarray and (N2,) ndarray of int
        Function curves and their lengths of supports.
        If ``None`` is passed, it is set to *profiles1*.
    n_jobs : int
        Number of parallel workers.

    Returns
    -------
    (N1, N2) array
        Discrete Fréchet distance matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    ``dfd(profiles1, None)`` is faster than ``dfd(profiles1, profiles1)``.
