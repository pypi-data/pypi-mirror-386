"""Pythia Eagle Strategy Designer.

The designer implements a variation of Eagle Strategy without the Levy random
walk, aka Firefly Algorithm [1].

Firefly Algorithm Summary
=========================
The Firefly algorithm is a genetic algorithm that operates by maintaining a
population of fireflies. Each firefly emits a light whose intensity corresponds
to the objective value being optimized. During each iteration, a firefly chases
after a brighter firefly in its vicinity, with the perceived brightness
diminishing as the distance increases. This feature fosters the formation of
multiple "clusters" of fireflies, as opposed to all fireflies converging to a
single point.

In addition to the inherent "attraction" forces guiding fireflies towards
brighter areas, we have incorporated a "repulsion" mechanism into the algorithm.
This means that fireflies not only move towards the brighter spots but also
actively move away from darker regions, enhancing the algorithm's exploration
capabilities.

We also incorporated support for various parameter types, including categorical,
discrete, and integer variables. We treat these parameter types uniquely when
computing distances, applying perturbations, and performing mutations on
fireflies, ensuring the algorithm's versatility in optimizing a wide range of
problem domains.

For more details about the Firefly algorithm, please refer to the linked paper.

OSS Vizier Implementation Summary
=================================
We maintain a dynamic pool of fireflies, with each firefly holding information
about the best trial it has produced. During the 'Suggest' phase, each firefly
takes its turn to propose a new trial. The best trial parameters are used to
calculate distances and generate fresh parameter suggestions by invoking the
'_mutate' and '_perturb' methods.

When the results of the suggested trials come in during the 'Update' phase,
we update/remove the corresponding firefly from the pool or create a new firefly
if necessary. To facilitate this association, during the 'Suggest' phase, each
newly sugggested trial stores in its metadata the identifier of its parent
firefly, denoted as 'parent_fly_id.' Over the course of the designer run, the
same firefly can be linked to multiple (child) trials that originated from it.

In our stateful implementation, across successive 'Suggest' calls, we
persistently maintain the firefly pool and update it using any new COMPLETED
trials that have not been seen before. We also ensure to not consecutively use
the same firefly for generating suggestions. Lastly we persist the maximum value
of firefly id created, to ensure that each firefly has its own unique id.
