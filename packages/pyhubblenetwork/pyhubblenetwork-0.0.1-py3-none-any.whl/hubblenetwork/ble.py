"""
16-bit UUID 0xFCA6 in 128-bit Bluetooth Base UUID form

Bluetooth spec defines a base UUID 0000xxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB.
Any 16-bit (or 32-bit) UUID is expanded into that base by substituting xxxx.

Libraries normalize to consistent 128-bit strings so you don’t have to guess
whether a platform will report 16- vs 128-bit in scan results.

In bleak, AdvertisementData.service_uuids and the keys in AdvertisementData.service_data
are 128-bit strings. So matching against the normalized 128-bit form is the most portable.
