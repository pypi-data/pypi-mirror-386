context.yml: '- Updated tools/module_files.py to enhance file writing safety and modularity
  for Terraform modules.

  - write_resource_file now excludes writing outputs.tf and facets.yaml, enforcing
  more strict validation on filenames and operation within the working directory.

  - Added write_outputs function to specifically handle writing output definitions
  to outputs.tf as a local block, supporting output attributes and interfaces.

  - These changes improve the flexibility and safety of module file manipulations
  in Terraform infrastructure code management.'
tools/module_files.py: This file provides utility functions for managing Terraform
  module files within a specified working directory. It includes functions to list
  module files, read and write Terraform resource files (excluding outputs.tf, which
  is handled separately), validate facets.yaml configuration files, and write the
  outputs.tf file with output attributes and interfaces. The module ensures safe file
  operations confined to the working directory and provides dry-run capabilities for
  configuration updates.
