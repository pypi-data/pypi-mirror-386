    Implemented support for the `reject` attribute in the GitLab driver.
    It allows specifying Merge Requests which should not be enqueued into
    a pipeline. The supported conditions cover the same Merge Requests'
    parameters as available in the existing `require` attribute â€“ filtering
    whether the Merge Request must (not) be open, merged, approved or contain
    some labels.
