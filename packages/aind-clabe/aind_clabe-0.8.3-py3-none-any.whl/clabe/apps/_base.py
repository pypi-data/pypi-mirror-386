    Abstract base class representing an application that can be run and managed.

    Defines the interface for applications that can be executed. Subclasses must
    implement the abstract methods to define specific application behavior.

    Type Parameters:
        TResult: The type of result returned by the application

    Methods:
        run: Executes the application
        get_result: Retrieves the result of the application's execution
        add_app_settings: Adds or updates application settings

        """
        Executes the application.

        This method should contain the logic to run the application and return the result of the execution.

        Returns:
            subprocess.CompletedProcess: The result of the application's execution.

        Retrieves the result of the application's execution.

        This property should return the result of the application's execution.

        Returns:
            subprocess.CompletedProcess: The result of the application's execution.

        Adds or updates application settings.

        This method can be overridden by subclasses to provide specific behavior for managing application settings.

        Example:
            ```python
