"""
Sequential Orchestration Demo with Dynamic RAG Tuning.

This demo showcases the complete sequential orchestration workflow:
1. Task decomposition with RAG awareness
2. Dynamic camper creation with role-specific RAG tuning
3. Sequential task execution with state management
4. Auditor with tuned RAG for task-specific validation
5. RAG state restoration after task completion

The demo demonstrates how the decomposer analyzes a complex task, creates
specialized campers with tuned RAG contexts, executes tasks sequentially,
and uses an auditor with focused RAG context for quality assurance.
