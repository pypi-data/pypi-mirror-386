## LLM Integration Patterns

The demos showcase several patterns for integrating Large Language Models into your Campfires applications:

### Pattern 1: LLMCamperMixin Integration

The most common pattern for adding LLM capabilities to your campers:

```python
from campfires import Camper, LLMCamperMixin, OpenRouterConfig

class MyIntelligentCamper(Camper, LLMCamperMixin):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        super().__init__(name)
        # Setup LLM configuration
        config = OpenRouterConfig(api_key="your-api-key")
        self.setup_llm(config)
    
    async def process(self, torch: Torch) -> Torch:
        # Use LLM for processing
        response = await self.llm_completion_with_mcp(f"Analyze: {torch.claim}")
        return Torch(claim=response, confidence=0.9)
```

### Pattern 2: Custom Prompt Engineering with override_prompt

For advanced LLM interactions with custom prompting strategies:

```python
class ExpertCamper(Camper, LLMCamperMixin):
    def override_prompt(self, torch: Torch) -> dict:
        """Custom prompt engineering for specialized responses"""
        enhanced_prompt = f"""
        You are an expert in {self.expertise}.
        Analyze: {torch.claim}
        Provide detailed insights and recommendations.
        """
        
        try:
            response = self.llm_completion_with_mcp(enhanced_prompt)
            return {
                "claim": response,
                "confidence": 0.85,
                "metadata": {"expertise": self.expertise}
            }
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "claim": f"Analysis failed: {str(e)}",
                "confidence": 0.1,
                "metadata": {"error": True}
            }
```

### Pattern 3: RAG-Enhanced Team Members

Combining document context with LLM reasoning for intelligent team collaboration:

```python
class TeamMember(Camper, LLMCamperMixin):
    def __init__(self, name: str, role: str, rag_context: str):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.role = role
        self.rag_context = rag_context
    
    def override_prompt(self, torch: Torch) -> dict:
        """RAG-enhanced responses with role-specific expertise"""
        enhanced_prompt = f"""
        {self.rag_context}
        
        Role: {self.role}
        Question: {torch.claim}
        
        Provide detailed recommendations based on your role and context.
        """
        
        response = self.llm_completion_with_mcp(enhanced_prompt)
        return {
            "claim": response,
            "confidence": 0.9,
            "metadata": {"role": self.role, "rag_enhanced": True}
        }
```
