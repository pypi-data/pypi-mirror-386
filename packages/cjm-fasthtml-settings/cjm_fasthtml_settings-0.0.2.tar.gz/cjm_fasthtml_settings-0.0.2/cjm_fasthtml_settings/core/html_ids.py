    This class extends AppHtmlIds from cjm_fasthtml_app_core with settings-specific IDs.
    It inherits ALERT_CONTAINER and as_selector() from the parent class.
    
    Inherited from AppHtmlIds:
        - ALERT_CONTAINER: "alert-container"
        - MAIN_CONTENT: "main-content"
        - as_selector(id_str): Converts an ID to CSS selector format (with #)
    
    For IDE Support:
        IDEs like VS Code with Pylance will autocomplete these attributes and warn
        if you try to access non-existent attributes.
    
    Note:
        The typing.Final annotation indicates these are constants that shouldn't
        be reassigned at runtime.
