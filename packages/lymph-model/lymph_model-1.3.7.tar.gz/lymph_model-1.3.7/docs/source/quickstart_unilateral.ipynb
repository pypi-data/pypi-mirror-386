    "# Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of people get diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in the head & neck region ([HNSCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer)), which frequently metastasizes via the lymphatic system. We set out to develop a methodology to predict the risk of a new patient having metastases in so-called lymph node levels (LNLs), based on their personal diagnosis (e.g. findings from a CT scan) and information of previously diagnosed and treated patients. And that's exactly what this code enables you to do as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, this package is meant to be a relatively simple-to-use frontend. The math is done under the hood and one does not need to worry about it a lot. But let's have a quick look at what we're doing here.\n",

For the spread between lymph node levels, we call it *transition probability rate*, e.g. $\\tilde{t}_{rv}$ from LNL $r$ to LNL $v$. The difference to the base probability rate is that it only plays a role if the parent LNL is already ivolved with metastases, while the tumor always spreads, of course.\n",
