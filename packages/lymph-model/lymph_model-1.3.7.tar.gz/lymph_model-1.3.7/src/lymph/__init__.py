"""The lymph package implements models for lymphatic metastatic spread.

It forms the basis of the first comprehensive statistical model to predict personalized
risks for occult disease in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.

These models may at some point be used to inform the elective clinical target volume
definition in radiotherapy treatment planning.
