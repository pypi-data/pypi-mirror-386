```

You should get an expected output of
```bash
['AgentToAgentInteractions', 'Answer Relevancy']
{'AgentToAgentInteractions': MetricResult(metric_name='AgentToAgentInteractions',
                                          value=[('supervisor -> research', 1), ('research -> supervisor', 1)],
                                          metadata={'metric_type': 'counter'},
                                          success='success',
                                          error_message=None),
 'Answer Relevancy': MetricResult(metric_name='Answer Relevancy',
                                  value=1.0,
                                  metadata={'threshold': 0.5, 'success': True, 'reason': 'The score is 1.00 because the response accurately and directly answered the question without any irrelevant information.', 'evaluation_cost': 0.0146, 'verbose_logs': 'Statements:\n[\n    "The 31st President of the United States was Herbert Hoover.",\n    "He served from 1929 to 1933.",\n    "You can find more information about him on Wikipedia."\n] \n \nVerdicts:\n[\n    {\n        "verdict": "yes",\n        "reason": null\n    },\n    {\n        "verdict": "yes",\n        "reason": null\n    },\n    {\n        "verdict": "idk",\n        "reason": null\n    }\n]'},
                                  success=True,
