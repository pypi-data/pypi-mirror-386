Add 2 fields on the product form that compute the standard (or
theorical) margin and markup based on the current values of sale and
standard price present in the product form. We take care of taxe
included or excluded.

It will just compute it as follow: Margin : (Sale Price without tax -
Standard Price) / Sale Price without tax Markup : (Sale Price without
tax - Standard Price) / Standard Price

**Note:**

As this module will base his simple computation on sale and cost prices,
it suppose you have them both in the same currency (the price type must
of the same currency for both of them). Remember this is the default
OpenERP configuration (price type of all product price fields are set as
the same as the company currency). We don't take care of it cause
otherwise we should have added a dependency on sale module.
