# Open Ticket AI 1.2 Lands

**Release date:** October 13, 2025

Open Ticket AI 1.2 is live with focused upgrades that keep on-prem support teams fast and safe.

## Feature Boosts
- New HuggingFace plugin brings local ML inference without extra cloud hops.
- Nested composite pipes let you chain automation blocks without brittle workarounds.
- OTOBO adapter now speaks version 11, so hybrid shops can upgrade without rewrites.

## Polish & Safety
- Sharper pipe error messages mean operators spot misconfigurations instantly.
- Dependency refresh closes CVE-2025-1234 and tightens runtime security.
- Template rendering leak fixed and timezone math corrected for scheduled jobs.

## Heads-Up
- Legacy pipe naming and the old config schema enter deprecationâ€”migrate to the new YAML layout next.
