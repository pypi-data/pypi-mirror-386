        ## Documentation Request - Implementation Guide
        
        **How to write documentation:**
        - Write in Markdown format for VitePress
        - Place docs in `docs/vitepress_docs/docs_src/en/` (English)
        - Include YAML config examples with proper syntax highlighting
        - Add links to related documentation and API references
        
        **Documentation structure:**
        - User guides: End-to-end workflows and tutorials
        - Developer docs: Architecture, API, and implementation details
        - Reference docs: Configuration schema, pipe catalog, CLI commands
        - Use VitePress components for callouts, tabs, and code groups
        
        **Quality gates (must pass):**
          KEEP the documentation small and precise, especially dont add long texts! Focus on the core of the software.
          Use Mermaid Diagrams, Tables, and Lists to structure information clearly.
          DO NOT write long texts!
          NEVER write documentations in oher languages than in english!
          THE documentation in fr, de, es, it, pt, nl, pl, ru, cn, jp is automatically generated with AI from the english docs.
          DO NOT write documentations in other languages than in english!
        - Markdown files have valid syntax
        - All links work (internal and external)
        - Code examples are tested and working
        - VitePress builds successfully: `cd docs && npm run docs:build`
        - No spelling/grammar issues in English docs
        
        **Issue is DONE when:**
        - Documentation is written and placed in correct location
        - All code examples are tested
        - Links are verified
        - VitePress builds without errors
        - Documentation is clear and helpful
