			<link:arcroleType id="instant-inflow" cyclesAllowed="undirected" arcroleURI="http://www.xbrl.org/2023/arcrole/instant-inflow">
				<link:definition>Indicates that the inflow duration concept adds to the balance of the instant concept. An accounting instant concept with a debit balance will have an associated inflow concept with a debit balance. An instant concept with a credit balance will have an associated inflow concept with a credit balance. This relationship can be used to define the components of a rollforward or to indicate how concepts measured over a period of time impact the balances of concepts measured at a point in time. An example of this arc would be the relationship between the source concept "Cash" and the target concept "Cash Proceeds from the Sale of Fixed Assets".</link:definition>

				<link:definition>Indicates that the outflow duration concept reduces the balance of the instant concept. An accounting instant concept with a debit balance will have an associated outflow element with a credit balance.  This relationship can be used to define the components of a rollforward or to indicate how concepts measured over a period of time impact the balances of concepts measured at a point in time. An example of this arc would be the relationship between the source concept "Cash" and the target concept "Cash Payments for Fixed Assets".</link:definition>

            <link:arcroleType id="instant-contra" cyclesAllowed="undirected" arcroleURI="http://www.xbrl.org/2023/arcrole/instant-contra">
				<link:definition>Indicates that the target instant contra concept is an offset against the concept on the source instant end of the arc. The contra target concept must also be an instant concept and the balance type of the contra target concept must be the opposite balance type of the source instant concept. The value associated with the target contra concept should never exceed the value of the source instant concept in an instance document if both are reported with the same dimensions.  The arc can only flow in one direction. A concept cannot be a contra element to itself. An example contra target concept would be "Accumulated Depreciation" that links to a source concept of "Property Plant and Equipment Gross".  </link:definition>

             <link:arcroleType id="instant-accrual" cyclesAllowed="undirected" arcroleURI="http://www.xbrl.org/2023/arcrole/instant-accrual">
				<link:definition>Indicates the relationship between an instant concept and a durational accrual concept representing the provision of expense or income against the instant concept (Typically an asset or liability) to represent use  or interest costs during a reporting period where no cash transaction occurs. The source concept is always an instant and the target concept is always a duration. Examples include the relationship between the instant concept "Accumulated Depreciation" and the accrual concept "Depreciation" or the instant concept "Asset Retirement Obligation" and the duration concept "Accretion Expense". </link:definition>

            <link:arcroleType id="trait-concept" cyclesAllowed="none" arcroleURI="http://www.xbrl.org/2023/arcrole/trait-concept">
				<link:definition>Indicates the relationship between a source duration trait domain member and a target concept.  Trait concepts are abstract concepts with a domain item type. Trait-concept relationships describe the qualities or states of being of a target concept. Trait source concepts define a single trait such as Operating, Financing, Investing, Current, Noncurrent, Estimated Accrual, Continuing, Discontinued etc. The arc allows specific accounting or non-accounting traits to be associated with a target concept using the definition linkbase, thus allowing the attributes to be explicitly stated rather than being included as adjectives in the concepts name or label. This arc can be used in conjunction with the class-subclass arcrole. A subclass of a class concept assigned a trait will inherit that trait. For example if concept "Cash" is the target of a trait-concept arc with a source concept of "Current", then the subclass of the "Cash" concept "Cash In Bank" would also inherit the "Current" trait.</link:definition>

			<link:arcroleType id="class-subclass" cyclesAllowed="undirected" arcroleURI="http://www.xbrl.org/2023/arcrole/class-subclass">
				<link:definition>Indicates the relationship between a source class concept and a target subclass concept.  Class-subclass relationships describe that the target concept has the same attributes of the class concept with further qualifiers. This means all the traits of the class source concept are also appplicable to the target subclass concept. This mirrors class relationships such as type-of in UML or class-subclass on Object Oriented Programming. The class-subclass relationship cannot have a source or target concept that has a trait datatype. The trait datatype is a single trait. It cannot inherit other traits as a target of a class-subclass arc. In addition a trait concept cannot  be the source of a class-subclass arc. This would result in the subclass being a duplicate of the class as trait concepts can only have one trait.   This arc can be used in conjunction with the trait-concept arcrole. Any target subclass of a source class concept with trait-concept will inherit these traits. For example if concept "Cash" is the target of a trait-concept arc with a source concept of "Current", then the subclass of the "Cash" concept "Cash In Bank" would also inherit the "Current" trait.  Inheritance applies across all networks in the DTS. For example in the example above if the class-subclass relationship is in a different network than the trait-concept relationship then "Cash In Bank" would still inherit the "Current" trait. A class-subclass element cannot refer to itself. The class-subclass relationship cannot be defined between concepts with conflicting concept attributes. For example a source instant concept cannot link to a target duration concept, a source debit balance concept cannot link to a credit balance concept. The target concept must have the same data-type or a specialization of the source class concept datatype. For example a source concept with a datatype of decimal can link to target concept with a datatype of integer, but cannot link to a target concept with a datatype of string.</link:definition>

			<link:arcroleType id="trait-domain" cyclesAllowed="undirected" arcroleURI="http://www.xbrl.org/2023/arcrole/trait-domain">
				<link:definition>Defines a relationship between the trait type concept and the domain which represents a set of possible trait values. For example a trait type of liquidity may have values of current and noncurrrent. The source of the arc is the trait type concept liquidity. The target of the arc would be the Liquidity domain. The target must be a domain member. The liquidity domain has possible trait values of current member and non current member.  The traits Current or Noncurrent are linked to concepts using the trait-concept arc. The use of a domain allows the integrity of the model to be checked. No concept as a target  of the trait-concept arc can have more than one trait from a given trait domain. I.e. A concept cannot be defined as current and noncurrent.</link:definition>
