LINE_LENGTH: 79

**********
def complex_function():
    """
    This is a function that does something.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : list[tuple[int, str]] | None, optional
        The alpha parameter controls the behavior in a very long and descriptive way that will certainly exceed the maximum line length and thus needs wrapping across multiple lines.
    beta : dict[str, list[int]]
        The beta parameter is also described with many details that should cause the line to wrap according to the specified width to ensure readability and consistency.
    gamma : str
        This gamma parameter requires wrapping because its description is intentionally verbose and includes multiple clauses that extend beyond the limit.

    Returns
    -------
    result1 : dict[str, int]
        The first return value contains aggregated information computed from the inputs and needs to be explained thoroughly so it wraps properly.
    result2 : list[str]
        The second return value is a list of messages; its description is long enough that it will wrap as well.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If alpha is invalid or contains values that cannot be processed, an error is raised; the description here is long and will wrap.
    TypeError
        If the types of beta or gamma do not match the expected types, a suitable error is raised with an explanation which may wrap.
    RuntimeError
        If an unexpected internal issue occurs during processing, a runtime error is raised with a long explanation that wraps too.
