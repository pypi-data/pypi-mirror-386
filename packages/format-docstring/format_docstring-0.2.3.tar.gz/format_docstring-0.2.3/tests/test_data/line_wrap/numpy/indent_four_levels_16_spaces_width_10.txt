LINE_LENGTH: 10

**********
                This paragraph is indented by sixteen spaces. With a
                small line-length, the available width after indentation
                is tiny, so wrapping becomes very aggressive. The indent
                is always preserved; words wrap as needed without mid-word
                splitting.

                This
                paragraph
                is
                indented
                by
                sixteen
                spaces.
                With
                a
                small
                line-length,
                the
                available
                width
                after
                indentation
                is
                tiny,
                so
                wrapping
                becomes
                very
                aggressive.
                The
                indent
                is
                always
                preserved;
                words
                wrap
                as
                needed
                without
                mid-word
                splitting.
