Official code for benchmark generation and evaluation of action model 
learning approaches.



### Installation
```
pip install amlgym
```

### Example usage
```
from amlgym.algorithms import get_algorithm
agent = get_algorithm('OffLAM')
model = agent.learn('path/to/domain.pddl', ['path/to/trace0', 'path/to/trace1'])
print(model)
```

### Documentation
Tutorials and API documentation is accessible on [Read the Docs](https://amlgym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## State-of-the-art Algorithms
AMLGym provides seamless integration with state-of-the-art algorithms 
for offline learning classical planning domains from an input set of 
trajectories in the following settings:
1. **full** observability: SAM [1].
2. **partial** observability: OffLAM [2].
3. **full** and **noisy** observability: NOLAM [3], ROSAME [4].

It is possible to run the above algorithms as of the `main.py` script, 
which by default runs SAM, OffLAM, NOLAM, and ROSAME on every domain and associated 
set of trajectories in `benchmarks/trajectories/learning`.

### Adding an algorithm
PRs with new or existing state-of-the-art algorithms are welcome:

1. Add the algorithm PyPI package in `requirements.txt`
2. Create a Python class in `algorithms` which inherits from `AlgorithmAdapter.py` and implements the `learn` method


## Evaluation

AMLGym can evaluate a PDDL model by means of several metrics:
1. _Syntactic_ precision and recall 
2. _Predicted_ applicability and effects
3. _Solvability_ metrics: False plans and problem solving ratios.

## Benchmarking
