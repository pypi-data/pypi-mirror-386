    Spatially-aware quality control for spatial transcriptomics


SpotSweeper is a package developed for spatially-aware quality control (QC) methods for the detection, visualization, and removal of both local outliers and regional artifacts in spot-based spatial transcriptomics data, such as 10x Genomics Visium, using standard QC metrics.

Features
--------
- Detect local outliers using robust z-score
- Plot and highlight local outliers in a spatial context (both showing on screen (interactive) and saving to PDF)

Installation
------------

Install from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install spotsweeper

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    import spotsweeper.local_outliers as lo 
    import spotsweeper.plot_QC as plot_QC
    import spotsweeper.plot_QCpdf as pdf
    lo.local_outliers(adata, metric = "total_counts", sample_key = "region")
    plot_QC.plot_qc_metrics(adata,"region",metric = "total_counts", outliers="total_counts_outliers")
    pdf.plot_qc_pdf(adata,"region",metric = "total_counts", outliers="total_counts_outliers")

Project Status
--------------

This package is in early development. Use with caution; interfaces may change.
