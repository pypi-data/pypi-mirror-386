    """
    Function decorator for a @<prop>.setter that raises if you try to set again.

    This decorator prevents reassigning a property after it's been set once,
    with configurable exceptions.

    Parameters:
        attr_name (str, optional):
            The name of the underlying private attribute to check. If not provided,
            it will be derived from the setter's function name by prepending a
            single underscore (e.g., `value` becomes `_value`). If your setter
            name starts with a single underscore (e.g., `_internal_val`), you *must*
            provide this parameter explicitly.
        exception (Exception class, optional):
            The exception to raise on reassignment.
            Defaults to raise an AttributeError.
        allow_none_reassignment (bool, optional):
            If True, allows setting the property to None even if it's already set.
            Defaults to False.
        treat_none_as_unset (bool, optional):
            If True, None values are considered as unset, allowing the property
            to be set if its current value is None.
            Defaults to True.
        allow_reassignment_to_same_value (bool, optional):
            If True, allows reassigning the property with the same value.
            It passes silently and does not call the setter again.
            Defaults to False.
        fail_silently (bool, optional):
            If True, instead of raising an exception on a forbidden reassignment,
            the setter simply returns silently.
            Defaults to False.

    Raises:
        ImplicitNameDerivationError:
            If the decorated setter's name starts with a single underscore
            (but not a double underscore, which has its own meaning) and
            `attr_name` is not provided. This is to prevent accidental
            triggering of Python's name mangling.
        exception: (Defaults to AttributeError)
            Raised when a forbidden attempt to reassign the property occurs,
            unless `fail_silently` is True.

    Example:
        ```python
        class MyClass:
            def __init__(self):
                self._value = None # Underlying attribute

            @property
            def value(self):
                return self._value

            @value.setter
            @freeze_setter() # Derives attr_name as '_value'
            def value(self, new_value):
                self._value = new_value

        obj = MyClass()
        obj.value = 42
        # obj.value = 100  # Raises AttributeError

        class InternalPropClass:
            def __init__(self):
                self.__internal_storage = None # Explicit private attribute

            @property
            def _internal_prop(self):
                return self.__internal_storage

            @_internal_prop.setter
            @freeze_setter(attr_name='__internal_storage') # Must provide attr_name
            def _internal_prop(self, new_value):
                self.__internal_storage = new_value
        ```
