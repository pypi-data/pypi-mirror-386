"""
LED Matrix controller wiring together mixin components with the device base.

Key design notes:
- Multiple inheritance uses cooperative initialization via ``super()``.
- ``DeviceBase`` is placed early in the MRO so mixins can safely access ``self.device``.
- ``BrightnessManager`` precedes ``BreatherManager`` in the MRO because the breather
  inspects the controller brightness on initialization.
- ``IdentifyManager`` comes after ``BreatherManager`` because it may call
  ``@synchronized`` methods during ``__init__`` which expect a breather pause context.
- ``Loggable`` is placed last so we can pass ``parent_log_device=...`` through the cooperative
  chain without colliding with other mixin keyword arguments.
- Logging cooperates with an InspyLogger ``Loggable`` when available, but a lightweight
  fallback is supported. The controller passes ``parent_log_device`` through the chain;
  the fallback stub also accepts this parameter.
