    """Execute bundles in a single process with cooperative worker threads.

    Stop Model:

    - All bundles share one [`ThreadingEvent`][agentlightning.ThreadingEvent]
      named `stop_evt`.
    - Only the main thread receives `KeyboardInterrupt`. When Ctrl+C occurs we
      set `stop_evt`.
    - Any exception raised inside a bundle sets `stop_evt` so other threads can
      unwind cooperatively.
    - Once the bundle running on the main thread exits successfully the
      treatment depends on `main_thread`:
        - `"algorithm"`: the runners are asked to stop by setting `stop_evt`.
        - `"runner"`: the algorithm keeps running until it exits naturally.
    - Background threads are marked as daemons. We join them briefly and log any
      stragglers before shutting down.

    !!! note
        Signals other than `SIGINT` (such as `SIGTERM`) are not intercepted;
        Python's default behavior for those signals is preserved.
