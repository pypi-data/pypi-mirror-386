class LightningStore:
    """Contract for the persistent control-plane that coordinates training rollouts.

    A `LightningStore` mediates every interaction between algorithms and runners:

    - **Rollout lifecycle:** accept new rollouts, queue them for execution, create attempts,
      and drive the rollout status machine (`"queuing"` → `"preparing"` → `"running"` →
      `{"succeeded","failed","cancelled"}` or `"requeuing"` when a retry is justified).
    - **Attempt tracking:** record each execution attempt, including progress heartbeats,
      retry sequencing, and terminal states such as `"timeout"` or `"unresponsive"`.
    - **Span ingest:** capture structured telemetry emitted by runners (either as native
      [`Span`][agentlightning.Span] objects or as `opentelemetry.sdk.trace.ReadableSpan`
      instances) so that algorithms can reconstruct trajectories and rewards.
    - **Resource versioning:** manage immutable snapshots of named resources
      (prompt templates, model checkpoints, proxy endpoints, …) and expose a single
      "latest" snapshot that runners can fetch just after claiming work.

    Implementations must provide thread-safe/async-safe semantics: each coroutine should
    appear atomic to callers even when multiple algorithms or runners call the API concurrently.
    Unless stated otherwise, missing identifiers should result in a `ValueError`.
