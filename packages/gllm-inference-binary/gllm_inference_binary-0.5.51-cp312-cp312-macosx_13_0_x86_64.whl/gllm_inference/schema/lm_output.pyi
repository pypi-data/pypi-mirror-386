            for the language model. Defaults to None.
        token_usage (TokenUsage | None): The token usage analytics, if requested. Defaults to None.
        duration (float | None): The duration of the invocation in seconds, if requested. Defaults to None.
        finish_details (dict[str, Any]): The details about how the generation finished, if requested.
            Defaults to an empty dictionary.
        reasoning (list[Reasoning]): The reasoning, if the language model is configured to output reasoning.
            Defaults to an empty list.
        citations (list[Chunk]): The citations, if the language model outputs citations. Defaults to an empty list.
        code_exec_results (list[CodeExecResult]): The code execution results, if the language model decides to
            execute code. Defaults to an empty list.
        mcp_calls (list[MCPCall]): The MCP calls, if the language model decides to invoke MCP tools.
