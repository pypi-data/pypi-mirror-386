# ADR-006: Unified Execution Model (Fractal Architecture)

## Status
**✅ Completed** (Started: 2025-10-21, Completed: 2025-10-21)

## Context
The current architecture has redundant abstractions (Result wrapper, multiple metadata fields, separate BlockExecutor/WorkflowExecutor) that violate YAGNI, KISS, and DRY principles. We need a unified, fractal architecture where workflows and blocks share the same structure.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Pause Propagation: ExecutionPaused Exception
**Decision**: Use exception-based control flow for pauses (similar to Python's `StopIteration`)

**Rationale**:
- MCP has no bi-directional communication - pause means workflow terminates and returns to caller
- LLM calls separate `resume_workflow` tool later with checkpoint ID + response
- Exceptions naturally bubble through call stack (automatic propagation through nested workflows)
- Clean orchestrator pattern: `try/except ExecutionPaused/except Exception`
- Fits the "exceptions for exceptional control flow" paradigm

**Implementation**:
```python
class ExecutionPaused(Exception):  # Not an error - control flow mechanism
    def __init__(self, prompt: str, checkpoint_data: dict[str, Any]):
        self.prompt = prompt  # Message for LLM
        self.checkpoint_data = checkpoint_data  # Resume state
```

### 2. Child Execution: Fully Embedded (True Fractal)
**Decision**: Store complete child Execution in parent, including child's blocks

**Rationale**:
- **True fractal**: Every Execution has identical structure at all levels
- **No special cases**: ExecuteWorkflow returns `Execution`, orchestrator stores it directly
- **Debugging/reporting**: Traverse tree recursively - works automatically
- **Encapsulation maintained**: Variable resolution controls access, not structure
- **Memory**: Shallow depth (2-3 levels typical), nested dicts are efficient in modern Python

**Rejected Alternative** (Flattened): Would require:
- Custom flattening logic for arbitrary child outputs
- Separate mechanisms for debugging/reporting
- Loss of execution history
- Breaks fractal uniformity

**Structure**:
```python
parent_execution.blocks = {
    "run_tests": Execution(  # Full child execution embedded!
        outputs={"test_passed": True},
        blocks={  # Child's blocks preserved
            "pytest": Execution(...),
            "coverage": Execution(...)
        }
    )
}

# Variable access:
${blocks.run_tests.outputs.test_passed}  # Child's workflow output
${blocks.run_tests.blocks.pytest.outputs.exit_code}  # Deep access!
```

### 3. Circular Dependency Detection: Stack in _internal
**Decision**: Store workflow execution stack in `context._internal["workflow_stack"]`

**Rationale**:
- `_internal` is designed for orchestration state (hidden from variable resolution, not from executors)
- Thread-safe: Each Execution has its own `_internal`
- Maintains executor statelessness (no shared mutable state)
- Clean propagation through recursion
- Doesn't pollute public API

**Implementation**:
```python
# In WorkflowExecutor:
execution_context = Execution(
    _internal={
        "workflow_stack": [],
        "executor": self
    }
)

# In ExecuteWorkflow:
stack = context._internal.get("workflow_stack", [])
if inputs.workflow in stack:
    raise ValueError(f"Circular: {' → '.join(stack + [inputs.workflow])}")

# Create child with updated stack
child_context = Execution(
    inputs=inputs.inputs,
    _internal={
        "workflow_stack": stack + [inputs.workflow],
        "executor": context._internal["executor"]
    }
)
```

## Implementation Summary

All ADR-006 components have been successfully implemented and tested with **86 passing tests** (100% pass rate).

### ✅ Core Foundation Components

1. **[block_status.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/block_status.py)** - Execution state enums
   - `ExecutionStatus`: PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, SKIPPED, PAUSED
   - `OperationOutcome`: SUCCESS, FAILURE, NOT_APPLICABLE
   - Boolean helper methods: `is_completed()`, `is_failed()`, `is_skipped()`, etc.

2. **[metadata.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/metadata.py)** - Unified metadata class
   - Single source of truth for execution state + operation outcome
   - Factory methods: `from_success()`, `from_operation_failure()`, `from_execution_failure()`, `from_skipped()`, `from_paused()`
   - Dependency skip logic: `requires_dependent_skip(required: bool)`
   - Timing, wave tracking, execution order

3. **[execution.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/execution.py)** - Fractal execution model
   - Universal structure for workflows and blocks
   - Four namespaces: `inputs`, `outputs`, `metadata`, `blocks`
   - Private `_internal` namespace for orchestration state
   - Helper methods: `set_block_result()`, `get_block_metadata()`, `get_block_output()`
   - True fractal nesting: `blocks: dict[str, Execution]`

4. **[exceptions.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/exceptions.py)** - Workflow exceptions
   - `ExecutionPaused` exception for pause control flow
   - Bubbles through nested workflows naturally
   - Not an error - control flow mechanism for MCP pause/resume

5. **[orchestrator.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/orchestrator.py)** - Block execution wrapper
   - `BlockOrchestrator` class wraps all executor calls
   - Catches exceptions → creates appropriate Metadata
   - Catches `ExecutionPaused` → preserves pause state
   - Returns `BlockExecution` with output + metadata + pause info
   - Supports both execute and resume operations

### ✅ Executor Updates

1. **[executor_base.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/executor_base.py)** - Base class and registry
   - `execute(inputs, context: Execution) -> BaseModel` signature
   - `resume(inputs, context: Execution, ...) -> BaseModel` signature (optional)
   - Simplified `ExecutorRegistry` as Pydantic model with `PrivateAttr`
   - No Result wrapper - direct returns and exceptions

2. **[executor_workflow.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/executor_workflow.py)** - Fractal workflow composition
   - ExecuteWorkflow executor for nested workflows
   - Returns full child `Execution` (not BlockOutput)
   - Orchestrator stores child Execution directly in `parent.blocks[block_id]`
   - Enables true fractal nesting with deep variable access
   - Circular dependency detection via `workflow_stack` in `_internal`

3. **[executors_core.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/executors_core.py)** - Shell executor
   - Returns `ShellOutput` directly (no Result wrapper)
   - Raises exceptions for failures
   - Uses `Execution` context (not dict)

4. **[executors_file.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/executors_file.py)** - File operations
   - CreateFile, ReadFile, RenderTemplate executors
   - All updated to use Execution context
   - Direct returns and exception-based error handling

5. **[executors_interactive.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/executors_interactive.py)** - Interactive blocks
   - Prompt executor raises `ExecutionPaused`
   - Resume support via `resume()` method
   - Pause bubbles through orchestrator naturally

6. **[executors_state.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/executors_state.py)** - JSON state management
   - ReadJSONState, WriteJSONState, MergeJSONState executors
   - All using Execution context

### ✅ Workflow Executor (Core Orchestration)

1. **[executor.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/executor.py)** - Complete ADR-006 implementation
   - **Execution Model**: Uses `Execution` throughout (not dict context)
   - **Orchestrator Pattern**: All blocks execute via `BlockOrchestrator`
   - **Fractal Handling**: ExecuteWorkflow stores complete child `Execution` in `parent.blocks[block_id]`
   - **Metadata Factory**: Uses factory methods for all metadata creation
   - **Exception Flow**: Catches `ExecutionPaused` for checkpoint creation
   - **Two-Tier Resume API**:
     - `_resume_workflow_internal()` → returns `Execution` (for nested workflows)
     - `resume_workflow()` → public API returns `WorkflowResponse`
   - **Required Input Validation**: Validates required inputs before execution

### ✅ Checkpoint/Resume Architecture

1. **[checkpoint.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/checkpoint.py)** - Simplified Pydantic checkpoint
   - **Pydantic BaseModel**: `CheckpointState` uses Pydantic for automatic serialization
   - **Direct Execution Storage**: `context: Execution` field (not dict)
   - **No Manual Serialization**: Pydantic handles `Execution` → JSON automatically
   - **Resume State**: Stores workflow stack, completed blocks, execution waves
   - **Pause Metadata**: Captures paused block ID, prompt, pause-specific data

**Checkpoint Save Pattern**:

```python
# Simplified - pass Execution directly
checkpoint_state = CheckpointState(
    checkpoint_id=checkpoint_id,
    context=context,  # Pydantic handles serialization
    # ... other fields
)
await self.checkpoint_store.save_checkpoint(checkpoint_state)
```

**Resume Pattern**:

```python
# Load checkpoint - Pydantic handles deserialization
checkpoint = await self.checkpoint_store.load_checkpoint(checkpoint_id)
context = checkpoint.context  # Already an Execution object

# Restore _internal state (PrivateAttr not serialized)
context._internal = {
    "executor": self,
    "workflow_stack": [ws["name"] for ws in checkpoint.workflow_stack]
}

# Resume execution from checkpoint
```

### ✅ Variable Resolution

1. **[variables.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/variables.py)** - Execution-aware resolution
   - Works with `Execution` model (executor converts to dict for compatibility)
   - Supports nested access: `${blocks.x.blocks.y.outputs.z}` (deep fractal nesting)
   - Shortcut accessors: `${blocks.id.succeeded}` → `${blocks.id.metadata.succeeded}`
   - Security: Blocks access to `__internal__` namespace

### ✅ Response Model

1. **[response.py](../src/workflows_mcp/engine/response.py)** - WorkflowResponse
   - Maps `ExecutionStatus` + `OperationOutcome` to MCP response status
   - Supports minimal and detailed response formats
   - Includes checkpoint_id and pause prompt for paused workflows

### ✅ Test Coverage

**86 tests passing** (100% pass rate, 1 intentional skip):

- Nested interactive workflow tests (pause/resume across multiple levels)
- Fractal execution structure tests
- Checkpoint save/load with Pydantic serialization
- Required input validation
- ExecuteWorkflow circular dependency detection
- Variable resolution with nested blocks
- Metadata factory methods
- Dependency skip propagation

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Checkpoint Simplification

**Original Approach**: Manual serialization of Execution → dict → CheckpointState (dataclass)

**Final Approach**: Pydantic BaseModel with direct Execution storage

**Rationale**:

- Pydantic automatically handles complex model serialization/deserialization
- Eliminates manual conversion code (`_execution_to_dict()` no longer needed for checkpoints)
- Type-safe with proper validation
- Simpler code with fewer potential bugs

### Two-Tier Resume API

**Pattern**: Internal method returning `Execution` + public method returning `WorkflowResponse`

**Implementation**:

```python
# Internal - for ExecuteWorkflow nested delegation
async def _resume_workflow_internal(checkpoint_id, response) -> Execution

# Public - for MCP tool API
async def resume_workflow(checkpoint_id, response, response_format) -> WorkflowResponse
```

**Rationale**:

- Matches the pattern used in `execute_workflow` (consistent API design)
- ExecuteWorkflow can delegate to internal method (fractal recursion)
- Public API maintains MCP protocol compliance (WorkflowResponse format)
- Clean separation of concerns

### Failed ExecuteWorkflow Handling

**Challenge**: When ExecuteWorkflow block fails, output is None but variable resolution expects Execution structure

**Solution**: Create minimal Execution object with empty outputs on failure

```python
if block_execution.output is None:
    # ExecuteWorkflow failed - create minimal Execution
    context.blocks[block_id] = Execution(
        inputs=resolved_inputs,
        outputs={},
        metadata=block_execution.metadata,
        blocks={},
    )
```

**Rationale**:

- Maintains fractal structure consistency (blocks always contain Execution objects)
- Variable resolution can safely navigate failed blocks without special cases
- Metadata contains failure information for debugging

### Required Input Validation

**Location**: `_merge_workflow_inputs()` method in WorkflowExecutor

**Implementation**: Validates required inputs before workflow execution starts

**Rationale**:

- Fail fast - detect missing inputs before expensive operations
- Clear error messages guide users to provide missing inputs
- Prevents partial workflow execution with invalid state

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Pydantic for Serialization**: Using Pydantic BaseModel for CheckpointState eliminated manual serialization complexity
2. **Factory Methods**: Metadata factory methods (`from_success()`, `from_operation_failure()`, etc.) enforced correct state combinations
3. **Exception-Based Control Flow**: ExecutionPaused exception naturally bubbles through nested workflows without special handling
4. **Fractal Consistency**: Maintaining Execution structure for all blocks (even failed ones) simplified variable resolution

### Technical Insights

1. **PrivateAttr Not Serialized**: Pydantic's `PrivateAttr` fields (like `_internal`) are not included in serialization - must restore manually on resume
2. **Boolean Helper Methods**: Enum methods like `.is_failed()` provide cleaner code than direct enum comparison
3. **Import Organization**: File-level imports preferred over inline imports for clarity
4. **Two-Tier API Pattern**: Internal + public method pattern enables both nested delegation and MCP compliance

### Code Quality Principles Applied

- **YAGNI**: Removed unnecessary helper methods (e.g., `_restore_execution_from_checkpoint`)
- **DRY**: Reused existing patterns (two-tier API matching execute_workflow)
- **KISS**: Simplified checkpoint architecture by leveraging Pydantic capabilities
- **Type Safety**: Strict type hints throughout with mypy compliance

## Decision

### Core Principles

1. **Fractal/Recursive Design** - Same structure at all levels (workflows and blocks)
2. **Single Source of Truth** - One execution model, one metadata class
3. **Separation of Concerns** - Execution state vs operation outcome
4. **Type Safety** - Pydantic models throughout
5. **No Wrapper Classes** - Return output directly, raise exceptions for failures

## Architecture

### 1. Execution State (Lifecycle)

```python
class ExecutionStatus(str, Enum):
    """
    Execution lifecycle states (fractal - same for workflows and blocks).

    Represents whether the executor ran, not whether the operation succeeded.
    """

    PENDING = "pending"
    """Queued but not started."""

    RUNNING = "running"
    """Currently executing."""

    COMPLETED = "completed"
    """Executor finished running (operation may have succeeded or failed)."""

    FAILED = "failed"
    """Executor crashed / couldn't run (variable error, validation, exception)."""

    SKIPPED = "skipped"
    """Did not execute (condition false or dependency not met)."""

    PAUSED = "paused"
    """Paused waiting for external input."""

    # Boolean helpers
    def is_pending(self) -> bool:
        return self == ExecutionStatus.PENDING

    def is_running(self) -> bool:
        return self == ExecutionStatus.RUNNING

    def is_completed(self) -> bool:
        return self == ExecutionStatus.COMPLETED

    def is_failed(self) -> bool:
        return self == ExecutionStatus.FAILED

    def is_skipped(self) -> bool:
        return self == ExecutionStatus.SKIPPED

    def is_paused(self) -> bool:
        return self == ExecutionStatus.PAUSED
```

### 2. Operation Outcome

```python
class OperationOutcome(str, Enum):
    """
    Operation outcome (separate from execution state).

    Represents whether the operation succeeded, independent of whether
    the executor ran.
    """

    SUCCESS = "success"
    """Operation succeeded (e.g., Shell exit 0, file created)."""

    FAILURE = "failure"
    """Operation failed (e.g., Shell exit 1, validation error)."""

    NOT_APPLICABLE = "n/a"
    """No operation outcome (FAILED, SKIPPED, PAUSED executions)."""

    # Boolean helpers
    def is_success(self) -> bool:
        return self == OperationOutcome.SUCCESS

    def is_failure(self) -> bool:
        return self == OperationOutcome.FAILURE

    def is_not_applicable(self) -> bool:
        return self == OperationOutcome.NOT_APPLICABLE
```

### 3. Metadata (Single Source of Truth)

```python
class Metadata(BaseModel):
    """
    Execution metadata (fractal - same for workflows and blocks).

    Single source of truth combining execution state and operation outcome.
    """

    # Execution state (did executor run?)
    status: ExecutionStatus

    # Operation outcome (did operation succeed?)
    outcome: OperationOutcome

    # Timing
    execution_time_ms: float
    started_at: str
    completed_at: str

    # Position in parent execution
    wave: int = 0
    execution_order: int = 0

    # Message (for failures, skips)
    message: str | None = None
    """Informational message (error details, skip reason, etc.)."""
```

#### Factory Methods (Correct by Construction)

#### Dependency Logic

```python
def requires_dependent_skip(self, required: bool = True) -> bool:
    """
    Check if child block (dependent) should skip based on this parent block's state.

    Args:
        required: True if child requires parent success (default), False if optional

    Returns:

    Dependency Logic (from child's perspective):
        required=True (default):
            - Child REQUIRES parent to succeed
            - Skip child unless parent: COMPLETED + SUCCESS
            - Cascade skip for parent states: FAILED, SKIPPED, COMPLETED+FAILURE

        required=False (optional - ordering only):
            - Child runs even if parent fails/skips
            - Skip child only if parent: FAILED (executor crashed)
            - Run child if parent: SKIPPED or COMPLETED (regardless of outcome)
    """
    if required:
        # Required dependency - child requires parent to complete successfully
        return not (
            self.status == ExecutionStatus.COMPLETED

        # Skip child only if parent FAILED (executor crashed - couldn't run)

### 4. Execution Model (Fractal/Recursive)

```python
class Execution(BaseModel):
    """
    Universal execution model (fractal/recursive).

    This is THE ONLY execution structure. Used for:
    - Workflows (top-level executions)
    - Blocks (child executions within workflows)
    - Nested workflows (via ExecuteWorkflow)

    Every execution has the same structure, enabling fractal composition.

### 5. Executor Pattern (Unified)

```python
class Executor(ABC):
    """
    Base executor (fractal - executes any Execution).

    This is the unified executor interface. All executors follow this pattern:
    - Leaf executors: Shell, CreateFile, etc. (execute operations)
    - Composite executors: Workflow (execute child executions)

    Every executor operates on the same Execution model.
    """

    # Class attributes (set by subclasses)
    type_name: str
    """Executor type identifier (e.g., 'Shell', 'Workflow')."""

    input_type: type[BaseModel]
    """Pydantic model for inputs."""

    output_type: type[BaseModel]
    """Pydantic model for outputs."""

    @abstractmethod

    """

    """

    model_config = {"arbitrary_types_allowed": True}

        """Check if executor type is registered."""

```

## State Combinations

### Valid State Combinations

| Status | Outcome | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| COMPLETED | SUCCESS | Executor ran, operation succeeded | Shell exit 0 |
| COMPLETED | FAILURE | Executor ran, operation failed | Shell exit 1 |
| FAILED | NOT_APPLICABLE | Executor crashed | Variable resolution error |
| SKIPPED | NOT_APPLICABLE | Didn't execute | Condition false |
| PAUSED | NOT_APPLICABLE | Waiting for input | Prompt block |
| PENDING | NOT_APPLICABLE | Not started yet | Queued |
| RUNNING | NOT_APPLICABLE | Currently executing | In progress |

## Dependency Semantics

The `required` field controls whether the **child block** (dependent) skips when the **parent block** (dependency) fails or is skipped.

### depends_on with required: true (default)

**Meaning**: The child block REQUIRES the parent to succeed - skip the child unless parent succeeds.

Skip child block if parent has:
- Parent: FAILED (executor crashed)
- Parent: SKIPPED (condition false)
- Parent: COMPLETED + FAILURE (operation failed)

✅ Run child block only if: Parent is COMPLETED + SUCCESS

### depends_on with required: false

**Meaning**: The child block runs even if parent fails/skips - dependency is for ordering only.

Skip child block only if:
- Parent: FAILED (executor crashed)

✅ Run child block if: Parent is SKIPPED, COMPLETED (regardless of SUCCESS/FAILURE)

**Rationale**: Optional dependencies (`required: false`) are just for execution ordering, not for success propagation.
The child block should run regardless of whether the parent was skipped or failed its operation.
Only executor crashes (FAILED status) should prevent execution.

### Summary Table

**Key**: Does the child block run based on parent block state?

| Parent Block State | required=true (default) | required=false (optional) |
|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| COMPLETED + SUCCESS | ✅ Run child | ✅ Run child |
| COMPLETED + FAILURE | ❌ Skip child | ✅ Run child |
| FAILED | ❌ Skip child | ❌ Skip child |
| SKIPPED | ❌ Skip child | ✅ Run child |

## Example Implementation

### Shell Executor

```python
class ShellInput(BaseModel):
    command: str
    working_dir: str = ""

class ShellOutput(BaseModel):
    exit_code: int
    stdout: str
    stderr: str

class ShellExecutor(Executor):
    type_name = "Shell"
    input_type = ShellInput
    output_type = ShellOutput

    async def execute(self, inputs: ShellInput, context: Execution) -> ShellOutput:
        process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(
            inputs.command,
            stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        )
        stdout, stderr = await process.communicate()

        return ShellOutput(
            exit_code=process.returncode,
            stdout=stdout.decode(),
            stderr=stderr.decode(),
        )
```

### Orchestrator Flow

```python
async def execute_block(
    block_id: str,
    executor: Executor,
    inputs: dict,
    context: Execution,
    wave: int,
    execution_order: int,
) -> None:
    """Execute a block and store result in context."""

    start_time = datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()
    timer = Timer()

    try:
        # Validate and execute
        validated_inputs = executor.input_type(**inputs)
        output = await executor.execute(validated_inputs, context)

        # Determine metadata from output
        if isinstance(output, ShellOutput):
            if output.exit_code == 0:
                metadata = Metadata.from_success(...)
            else:
                metadata = Metadata.from_operation_failure(
                    message=output.stderr or f"Exit code {output.exit_code}",
                    ...
                )
        else:
            metadata = Metadata.from_success(...)

    except Exception as e:
        # Executor failed (couldn't run)
        metadata = Metadata.from_execution_failure(
            message=f"Execution error: {e}",
            ...
        )
        output = executor.output_type()  # Default output

    # Store result
    context.set_block_result(
        block_id=block_id,
        inputs=validated_inputs.model_dump() if validated_inputs else {},
        outputs=output.model_dump(),
        metadata=metadata,
    )
```

## Benefits

1. **Fractal Design** - Same structure everywhere (workflows and blocks)
2. **Type Safety** - Pydantic models throughout
3. **Clear Semantics** - Execution state vs operation outcome
4. **No Redundancy** - Single source of truth (Metadata)
5. **Pythonic** - Direct returns, exception handling, no wrappers
6. **Maintainable** - Change logic in one place
7. **Testable** - Factory methods make testing easy

## Migration Path

**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-10-21)

All migration steps have been successfully completed:

1. ✅ Created new models (`Metadata`, `Execution`, `Executor`)
2. ✅ Updated all executors to use new pattern (Shell, File, Interactive, State, ExecuteWorkflow)
3. ✅ Updated WorkflowExecutor to use new metadata and Execution model
4. ✅ Updated dependency checking logic with `requires_dependent_skip()`
5. ✅ Updated variable resolution to work with Execution structure
6. ✅ Removed old classes - legacy executor preserved as `executor.py.old` for reference
7. ✅ Updated all tests (86 passing, 100% pass rate)

## Summary

ADR-006 has been fully implemented, achieving all design goals:

**Architecture Goals Achieved**:

- ✅ True fractal structure - same `Execution` model at all levels (workflows and blocks)
- ✅ Single source of truth - unified `Metadata` class for state + outcome
- ✅ Exception-based control flow - `ExecutionPaused` bubbles naturally through nested workflows
- ✅ Type safety - Pydantic models throughout with mypy compliance
- ✅ No wrapper classes - direct returns, exception-based error handling

**Code Quality Improvements**:

- **60% complexity reduction** - New executor.py is ~600 lines vs 1454 in old version
- **Simplified checkpoint** - Pydantic handles serialization automatically
- **Cleaner patterns** - Two-tier API, factory methods, boolean helpers
- **100% test pass rate** - 86 passing tests with comprehensive coverage

**Key Technical Achievements**:

- Fully embedded child executions enable deep variable access: `${blocks.x.blocks.y.outputs.z}`
- Checkpoint/resume works across arbitrarily nested workflows
- Failed blocks maintain fractal structure consistency
- Required input validation with clear error messages

**Production Ready**: The implementation is stable, well-tested, and ready for production use.
