INSTALLATION

GAP is distributed together with a large number of packages, including
this one. CaratInterface is located inside the subdirectory pkg/caratinterface/
of your GAP installation, and needs to be compiled. If you do not want to
build all packages with the script BuildPackages.sh from GAP, you can build
CaratInterface alone by executing these commands inside the directory
pkg/caratinterface/:

    ./configure <path-to-GAP-root>
    make

The configure script optionally takes the path to the root directory of 
your GAP installation as argument. The default ../.. should usually 
work, but if you have unpacked CaratInterace to a location like
~/.gap/pkg/caratinterface/, you need to explicitly give the path to
the GAP root directory as argument. The result of configure is written
to the file config.carat, which can be inspected if something goes wrong.

If GAP was configured to use a specific GMP library, or the GMP library
bundled with GAP, then CARAT will try to use that same GMP library.
Otherwise, the system GMP library in the default path is chosen. If you want
to use another GMP library, you may add an argument --with-gmp=<path-to-gmp>
to the above configure command, where the directory <path-to-gmp> must
contain subdirectories lib/ and include/ with the GMP library and include
files, respectively.

If you want or need to add further compile or link flags, you may prepend
CFLAGS="<your flags>" to the configure command, or append it to the make
command (one of these is enough), so that the complete build commands
including all options are these:

    [CFLAGS="<your flags>"] ./configure [<path-to-GAP-root>] [--with-gmp=<path-to-gmp>]
    make [CFLAGS="<your flags>"]

As CARAT's catalog of Q-classes of unimodular groups is rather large,
it is unpacked by default only up to dimension 5. If you also want
to unpack the data for dimension 6, you can do this with the extra
command (again inside directory pkg/carat/)

    make qcat6

This adds another 150 Mb of data to the installation.
