<h1>2 Installation</h1><p>
<p>
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> is distributed together with a large number of packages, including
this one. <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">CaratInterface</font> is located inside the subdirectory
<code>pkg/CaratInterface/</code> of your <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> installation, and the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">CARAT</font>
programs contained in it must be compiled. Compilation is most
conveniently done with the script <code>BuildPackages.sh</code> from <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>.
You can either build (almost) all packages, or only a single one
by giving its name on the command line. Alternatively, you can
compile <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">CARAT</font> inside <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">CaratInterface</font> manually, by executing
these commands inside the directory <code>pkg/CaratInterface/</code>:
<p>
<pre>
./configure &lt;path-to-GAP-root&gt;
make
</pre>
<p>
The configure script optionally takes the path to the root directory of 
your <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> installation as argument. The default <code>../..</code> should usually 
work, if the package is located in the <code>pkg</code> subdirectory of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
root directory,
but if you have unpacked <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">CaratInterface</font> to a location like
<code>&nbsp;/.gap/pkg/CaratInterface/</code>, you need to explicitly give the path to
the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> root directory as argument. The result of <code>configure</code> is
written to the file <code>config.carat</code>, which can be inspected if something
goes wrong.
<p>
If <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> was configured to use a specific GMP library, or the GMP library
bundled with <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>, then <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">CARAT</font> will try to use that same GMP library.
Otherwise, the system GMP library in the default path is chosen. If you want
to use another GMP library, you may add an argument <code>--with-gmp=path-to-gmp</code>
to the above configure command, where the directory <code>path-to-gmp</code> must
contain subdirectories <code>lib/</code> and <code>include/</code> with the GMP library and include
files, respectively.
<p>
If you want or need to add further compile or link flags, you may prepend
<code>CFLAGS="your flags"</code> to the configure command, or append it to the make
command (one of these is enough), so that the complete build commands
including all options are these:
<p>
<pre>
 [CFLAGS="&lt;your flags&gt;"] ./configure [&lt;path-to-GAP-root&gt;] [--with-gmp=&lt;path-to-gmp&gt;]
 make [CFLAGS="&lt;your flags&gt;"]
</pre>
<p>
As <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">CARAT</font>'s catalog of Q-classes of unimodular groups is rather large,
it is unpacked by default only up to dimension&nbsp;5. If you also want
to unpack the data for dimension&nbsp;6, you can do this with the extra
command (again inside directory <code>pkg/CaratInterface/</code>)
<p>
<pre>
make qcat6
</pre>
<p>
This adds another 150 Mb of data to the installation.
