        Test that GitHub's full API schema parses quickly.

        This is a regression test to ensure our performance optimizations
        (eliminating deepcopy, single-pass optimization, smart union adjustment)
        continue to work. Without these optimizations, this test would take
        multiple minutes to parse.

        On a local machine, this tests passes in ~2 seconds, but in GHA CI we see
        times as high as 6-7 seconds, so the test is asserted to pass in under
        10. Given that, this isn't intended to be a strict performance test, but
