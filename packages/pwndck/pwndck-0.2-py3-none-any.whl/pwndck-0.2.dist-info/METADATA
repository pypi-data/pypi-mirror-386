# pwndck

Check the the HaveIBeenPwned password database to see if a particular password
has been compromised.

It uses the [haveibeenpwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords)
for the check:
  * This use does not require an API key. Anyone can run it.
  * This is more secure than the [web page tool](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).
    your password is not exposed beyond your local machine.
  * It returns the number of times the password occurs in the database.

# Install
Install from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pwndck/)

# Usage

    $ pwndck.py -h
    usage: pwndck [-h] [-q] [password]
    
    Report # of password hits in HaveIBeenPwned
    
    positional arguments:
      password     The password to check
    
    options:
      -h, --help   show this help message and exit
      -q, --quiet  Suppress output
    
    Evaluate a password against the HaveIBeenPwned password
    database, and return the number of accounts for which it has
    been reported as compromised. If the password is not specified
    on the command line, the user will be prompted.
    
    The command returns with an error code if the password is
    found in the database.
