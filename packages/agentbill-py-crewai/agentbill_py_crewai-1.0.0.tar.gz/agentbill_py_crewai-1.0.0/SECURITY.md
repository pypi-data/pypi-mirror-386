### Security Best Practices

When using the AgentBill CrewAI integration:

1. **API Keys**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables: `os.getenv("AGENTBILL_API_KEY")`
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Use different keys for development/production

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep the package updated to the latest version
   - Run `pip install --upgrade agentbill-crewai` regularly
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Use `pip-audit` to check for vulnerabilities

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Review what data is being tracked
   - Implement proper data retention policies
   - Follow GDPR/CCPA guidelines if applicable
   - Be careful with sensitive data in agent prompts

4. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS endpoints only
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Use secure base URLs
   - Implement proper timeouts

## CrewAI-Specific Security

### Agent Prompt Security
Be aware that CrewAI agents may process sensitive information. The AgentBill integration tracks execution but does not validate or sanitize agent inputs.

### Data Capture
The integration captures:
- Agent roles and goals
- Task descriptions
- Execution metrics
- Token usage
- Error information

**Do not include sensitive data in agent configurations if you don't want it tracked.**

### Crew Execution
Ensure your crew executions:
- Don't expose credentials
- Handle errors gracefully
- Validate inputs appropriately
- Log securely
