The latest version of `instant-python` can be installed from PyPI:

!!! tip
    We highly recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages.

### Requirements

Instant Python tries to support the latest Python versions, we officially support from Python 3.10 to 3.13.
Older versions of Python may work, but they are not guaranteed to be compatible.
