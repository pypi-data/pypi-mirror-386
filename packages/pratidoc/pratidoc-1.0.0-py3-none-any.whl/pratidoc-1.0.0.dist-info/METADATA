## Features

__pratidoc__ is a __documentation checker__ which verifies if your project
contains a set of essential documentation files:

- __Well-defined files__: Only the files common in large open source projects
    are searched for.
- __Comprehensive choice__: Documents from a wide range of categories
    (like legal, governance, security, community, etc.) are included.
- __Link to source__: Wherever applicable each rule points to the
    official/well-respected resource with more information regarding it.

    - [Rules](#rules)

## Quick start

### Installation

> [!TIP]
> You can use your favorite package manager like
> [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
> [`hatch`](https://github.com/pypa/hatch)
> or [`pdm`](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm)
> instead of `pip`.

```sh
> pip install pratidoc
```

### Usage

To check against the rules run the following from the command line:

```sh
> pratidoc check
```

> [!NOTE]
> The command should be ran from the directory which we want to verify
> __and no path(s) should be passed as arguments!__

an example output could be:

```sh
> ALL:-:-: PRATIDOC1 Multiple README files exist.
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is a __repo-wide linter__, therefore it will not point to a specific
> line, instead `ALL:-:-:` means that the rule was violated in
> current working directory.

## Advanced

### Configuration

You can configure `pratidoc` in `pyproject.toml` (or `.pratidoc.toml`
in the root of your project, just remove the `[tool.pratidoc]` section),
for example:

```toml
[tool.pratidoc]
# include rules by their code
include_codes = [1, 2, 5] # default: all rules included
# exclude rules by their code (takes precedence over include)
exclude_codes = [4, 5, 6] # default: no rules excluded
# whether to exit after first error or all errors
end_mode = "first" # default: "all"
```

> [!WARNING]
> You can only disable rules via include/exclude codes as shown above.

### Run as a pre-commit hook

`pratidoc` can be used as a pre-commit hook, to add as a plugin:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: "https://github.com/open-nudge/pratidoc"
    rev: ...  # select the tag or revision you want, or run `pre-commit autoupdate`
    hooks:
    -   id: "pratidoc"
```

### Rules

> [!TIP]
> Run `pratidoc rules` to see the list of available rules.

`pratidoc` provides the following rules (links omitted for brevity):
