                                "description": "Get pods using the query parameters. This API allows you to search for pods across all registered clusters. You can filter results using resource attributes such as cluster or status. These filters accept comma-separated values, which are treated as OR conditions. For example, cluster=dev,prd will return pods that belong to either the dev or prd clusters. Note that the values must match exactly—partial matches are not supported. For instance, namespace=kube won’t match anything unless the namespace is exactly kube, whereas namespace=kube-system will match if that’s the exact value. For more advanced filtering, you can use the q query parameter. This supports token-based search using : instead of =. For example, q=name:metrics-server can also be shortened to q=name:metrics, since it matches based on word tokens. You can also perform comparisons using operators like > or < directly after the colon. For example, q=cpuUsage:>1000 will return pods with CPU usage greater than 1000. Logical operators like & (AND), | (OR), and parentheses for grouping are also supported. This allows you to build more complex queries, such as q=name:metrics&(cpuUsage:>1000)"
