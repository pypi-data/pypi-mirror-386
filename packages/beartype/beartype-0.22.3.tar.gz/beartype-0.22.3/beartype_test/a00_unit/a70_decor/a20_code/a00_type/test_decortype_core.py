**Beartype decorator class decoration** unit tests.

This submodule unit tests high-level functionality of the
:func:`beartype.beartype` decorator with respect to decorating **classes**
irrespective of lower-level type hinting concerns (e.g., PEP-compliance and
-noncompliance).

        variables whose values are types with nested classes by decorating the

             dunder attribute whose value is the :class:`type` superclass, which
             :func:`beartype.beartype` then decorated.
          #. However, the :class:`type` superclass defines the ``__base__``
             dunder attribute whose value is the :class:`object` superclass,
