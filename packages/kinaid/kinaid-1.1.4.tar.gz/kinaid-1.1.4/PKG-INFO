## Examples

### sandbox.ipynb

basic examples of loading phosphoproteomics data and running library version of kinaid

### yeast_tests.ipynb

notebook to generate yeast experiment data for Supplementary Table 4. The data must be loaded by the dashboard.

### offline_tests.ipynb

notebook to generate and run experiments for Supplementary Table 3. This experiment evaluated the performance of the library and not the dashboard.
