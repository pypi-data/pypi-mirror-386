# cdk-vscode-server

Running your dev IDE vscode on AWS for development and workshop purposes.

> [!Note]
> This construct is designed for workshop purposes and does not fulfill all security and authentication best practices.

![EXPERIMENTAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimantal-orange?style=for-the-badge)**<br>This is an early version of the package. The API will change while I
we implement new features. Therefore make sure you use an exact version in your `package.json` before it reaches 1.0.0.**

## Features

* ⚡ **Quick Setup**: Spin up and configure your [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) server in under 10 minutes in your AWS account
* 📏 **Best Practice Setup**: Set up with [projen](https://projen.io/) and a [single configuration file](./.projenrc.ts) to keep your changes centralized.
* 🤹‍♂️ **Pre-installed packages**: Besides the [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) server, other tools and software packages such as `git`, `docker`, `awscli` `nodejs` and `python` are pre-installed on the EC2 instance.
* 🌐 **Custom Domain Support**: Use your own domain name with automatic ACM certificate creation and Route53 DNS configuration, or bring your existing certificate.
* 🏗️ **Extensibility**: Pass in properties to the construct, which start with `additional*`. They allow you to extend the configuration to your needs. There are more to come...

## Usage

Actually we supported 2 modes:

### Standard

The following steps get you started:

1. Create a new `awscdk-app` via

```bash
npx projen new awscdk-app-ts --package-manager=npm
```

1. Add `@mavogel/cdk-vscode-server` as a dependency to your project in the `.projenrc.ts` file
2. Run `npx projen` to install it
3. Add the following to the `src/main.ts` file:

```python
import { App, Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as iam from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import {
  LinuxArchitectureType,
  LinuxFlavorType,
  VSCodeServer
} from '@mavogel/cdk-vscode-server';

export class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps = {}) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new VSCodeServer(this, 'vscode', {
      // for example (or simply use the defaults by not setting the properties)
      instanceVolumeSize: 8,
      instanceClass: ec2.InstanceClass.M7G,
      instanceSize: ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE,
      instanceOperatingSystem: LinuxFlavorType.UBUNTU_22,
      instanceCpuArchitecture: LinuxArchitectureType.ARM,

      // 👇🏽 or if you want to give the InstanceRole more permissions
      additionalInstanceRolePolicies: [
        new iam.PolicyStatement({
          effect: iam.Effect.ALLOW,
          actions: [
            'codebuild:*',
          ],
          resources: [
            `arn:aws:codebuild:*:${Stack.of(this).account}:*/*`,
          ],
        }),
      ]

      // and more... 💡
    });
  }
}

const env = {
  account: '123456789912',
  region: 'eu-central-1',
};

const app = new App();
new MyStack(app, 'vscode-server', { env });
app.synth();
```

and deploy it

```bash
npx projen build
npx projen deploy
```

with the output

```console
✨  Deployment time: 509.87s

Outputs:
dev.vscodedomainName6729AA39 = https://d1foo65bar4baz.cloudfront.net/?folder=/Workshop
dev.vscodepassword64FBCA12 = foobarbaz
```

See the [examples](./examples) folder for more inspiration.

### Custom Domain Configuration

You can configure your VS Code Server with a custom domain name instead of using the default CloudFront domain. The construct supports three different configuration options:

#### Option 1: Auto-create Certificate with DNS Validation

```python
new VSCodeServer(this, 'vscode', {
  domainName: 'vscode.example.com',
  hostedZoneId: 'Z123EXAMPLE456',  // optional - will auto-discover if not provided
  autoCreateCertificate: true,
});
```

This will:

* Create an ACM certificate in us-east-1 (required for CloudFront)
* Validate the certificate using DNS validation
* Create a Route53 A record pointing to the CloudFront distribution
* Configure the CloudFront distribution with the custom domain

#### Option 2: Use Existing Certificate

```python
new VSCodeServer(this, 'vscode', {
  domainName: 'vscode.example.com',
  hostedZoneId: 'Z123EXAMPLE456',
  certificateArn: 'arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012',
});
```

**Requirements:**

* Certificate must be in us-east-1 region
* Certificate must be validated and ready to use
* Certificate must include the domain name

#### Option 3: Default (No Custom Domain)

```python
new VSCodeServer(this, 'vscode', {
  // No domain configuration - uses CloudFront default domain
});
```

For complete examples, see [examples/custom-domain/main.ts](./examples/custom-domain/main.ts).

1. Then open the domain name in your favorite browser and you'd see the following login screen:
   ![vscode-server-ui-login](docs/img/vscode-server-ui-login-min.png)
2. After entering the password, you are logged into VSCode and can start coding :tada:

> There are issues with copy pasting into the VSCode terminal within the Firefox browser (2025-01-12)

## Inspiration

This project was created based on the following inspiration

* [vscode-on-ec2-for-prototyping](https://github.com/aws-samples/vscode-on-ec2-for-prototyping): as baseline, which unfortunately was outdated
* [aws-terraform-dev-container](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-terraform-dev-container): as baseline for terraform, but unfortunately also outdated
* [java-on-aws-workshop-ide-only.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/java-on-aws/blob/main/labs/unicorn-store/infrastructure/cfn/java-on-aws-workshop-ide-only.yaml): an already synthesized cloudformation stack, which used mostly python as the custom resources
* [fleet-workshop-team-stack-self.json](https://static.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/public/cc4aa67e-5b7a-4df1-abf7-c42502899a25/assets/fleet-workshop-team-stack-self.json): also an already synthesized cloudformation stack, which did much more as I currently implemented here.
* [eks-workshop-vscode-cfn.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/eks-workshop-v2/blob/main/lab/cfn/eks-workshop-vscode-cfn.yaml): another great baseline
