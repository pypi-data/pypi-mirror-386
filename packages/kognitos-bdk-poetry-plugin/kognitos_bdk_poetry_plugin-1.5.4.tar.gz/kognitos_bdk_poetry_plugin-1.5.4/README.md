# Poetry Plugin for Book Development Kit

The Poetry plugin for BDK is designed to enhance documentation workflows by automatically generating a comprehensive 
USAGE.md file from the docstrings embedded within a Poetry-managed Python project. This plugin seamlessly integrates 
with the Poetry ecosystem, parsing the docstrings of functions and classes to produce a well-structured and readable 
markdown file that outlines usage examples, input and output concepts, return types, and descriptions.
