# Installing dagster-iceberg

This library is available on pypi.

The following extras are available:

- daft (for interoperability with Daft dataframes)
- polars (for interoperability with Polars dataframes)
- pandas (for interoperability with Pandas dataframes)

Pyarrow is installed as a default dependency, so that IO Manager is always available.
