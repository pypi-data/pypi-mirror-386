# Document Class Architecture Review

## Overview

The `Document` class in `edgar.files.html` provides a structured representation of HTML content extracted from SEC filings. It implements a node-based architecture that preserves document structure while supporting rich text formatting and tabular data extraction.

### Key Components

- **Document**: Top-level container for parsed document nodes
- **BaseNode**: Abstract base class for all document node types
- **HeadingNode**: Represents section and subsection headings
- **TextBlockNode**: Represents paragraphs and text content
- **TableNode**: Represents tabular data with advanced processing
- **SECHTMLParser**: HTML parser that creates the node structure
- **IXTagTracker**: Tracks inline XBRL tags during parsing

### Primary Functionality

The `Document.parse()` method serves as the entry point, converting HTML text into a structured node tree that preserves document semantics, formatting, and inline XBRL metadata.

## Implementation Analysis

### Architectural Patterns

1. **Composite Pattern**: Implemented through `BaseNode` with specialized node types, allowing for a heterogeneous tree of document elements.
2. **Factory Method**: The `create_node()` function acts as a factory method for creating appropriate node instances based on content and type.
3. **Decorator Pattern**: The `StyleInfo` class applies layers of styling information, merging styles from parent elements with child elements.
4. **Strategy Pattern**: `TableProcessor` implements a strategy for processing tables, with specialized algorithms for different table structures.

### Code Quality

#### Strengths
- Strong typing with appropriate use of Union and Optional types
- Consistent use of dataclasses for node representations
- Clear separation of parsing logic from rendering logic
- Detailed handling of text formatting and whitespace normalization
- Comprehensive table processing with column alignment detection

#### Areas for Improvement
- High cyclomatic complexity in `_process_element` method
- Duplicate style parsing logic between html.py and styles.py
- Limited documentation for some private methods
- Heavy use of instance checking rather than polymorphism
- Some recursive methods lack depth limits for safety

## Parsing Workflow

The parsing process follows these key stages:

1. **HTML Parsing**: Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML into a DOM tree, handling malformed HTML and extracting the document root. (Implemented in `HtmlDocument.get_root()`)

2. **Node Creation**: Traverses the DOM tree, creating appropriate node objects based on element type, text content, and styling. (Implemented in `SECHTMLParser._process_element()` and helper methods)

3. **Inline XBRL Processing**: Tracks and processes inline XBRL tags, preserving metadata for fact extraction and financial data processing. (Implemented in `IXTagTracker` class methods)

4. **Style Analysis**: Analyzes CSS styles and element semantics to determine document structure, headings, and text formatting. (Implemented in `parse_style()` and `get_heading_level()`)

5. **Table Processing**: Processes HTML tables into structured TableNode objects with proper cell span handling and column alignment. (Implemented in `SECHTMLParser._process_table()`)

6. **Node Merging**: Merges adjacent text nodes with compatible styling to create a more concise document structure. (Implemented in `SECHTMLParser._merge_adjacent_nodes()`)

## Document.parse() Method Analysis

```python
@classmethod
def parse(cls, html: str) -> Optional['Document']:
    root = HtmlDocument.get_root(html)
    if root:
        parser = SECHTMLParser(root)
        return parser.parse()
```

### Method Characteristics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Low (2)
- **Lines of Code**: 5 lines
- **Dependencies**: `HtmlDocument`, `SECHTMLParser`

### Method Flow
1. Get document root using `HtmlDocument.get_root()`
2. Create `SECHTMLParser` instance with root
3. Call `parser.parse()` to create node structure
4. Return `Document` instance with parsed nodes

### Edge Cases Handled
- Returns None if document root cannot be found
- Properly handles malformed HTML through BeautifulSoup

### Suggestions
- Add error handling for parser.parse() failures
- Consider adding optional caching for parsed documents
- Add metadata extraction to the parse method signature

## Node Hierarchy Analysis

### BaseNode
- Abstract base class for all document nodes
- Key methods: `render()`, `type` property, metadata management
- Good extensibility through ABC pattern

### HeadingNode
- Represents section headings with level-based styling
- Strengths:
  - Level-aware rendering with appropriate visual hierarchy
  - Comprehensive styling based on heading importance
  - Good metadata support for semantic information

### TextBlockNode
- Represents paragraphs and formatted text content
- Strengths:
  - Sophisticated text wrapping algorithm
  - Alignment and style preservation
  - Efficient handling of long text blocks
- Improvements:
  - Could benefit from more advanced text styling capabilities
  - Limited support for lists and nested formatting

### TableNode
- Represents tabular data with advanced processing
- Strengths:
  - Sophisticated table processing with TableProcessor
  - Support for complex cell structures with colspan/rowspan
  - Intelligent column alignment detection
  - Efficient caching of processed tables
- Improvements:
  - Limited support for nested tables
  - No handling for table captions or footer rows

## Style Processing Analysis

Style processing is a crucial component that determines document structure and formatting. It handles inheritance, merging, and semantic interpretation.

### Key Components

1. **StyleInfo**
   - Dataclass representing CSS properties with proper unit handling
   - Style inheritance through the merge method

2. **parse_style**
   - Parses inline CSS styles into StyleInfo objects
   - Handles units, validation, and fallback to standard values

3. **get_heading_level**
   - Uses sophisticated heuristics to determine heading levels
   - Based on style, content, and document context

### Strengths
- Unit-aware style processing with proper conversions
- Sophisticated heading detection with multi-factor analysis
- Context-sensitive style inheritance model

### Improvements
- Duplicate style logic between files could be consolidated
- Limited support for advanced CSS features like flexbox
- No caching for repeated style parsing of identical styles

## Inline XBRL Handling

The `IXTagTracker` provides tracking and processing of inline XBRL tags, preserving metadata for financial data extraction.

### Key Features
- Tracks nested ix: tags and their attributes
- Handles continuation tags for fragmented XBRL facts
- Preserves context references for financial data analysis

### Integration Points
- Called during element processing in SECHTMLParser
- Metadata stored in node.metadata for downstream processing

### Improvements
- Limited documentation of XBRL namespaces and tag semantics
- No validation of XBRL context references
- Could benefit from performance optimization for large documents

## Technical Debt

### Code Complexity
1. **SECHTMLParser._process_element**
   - High cyclomatic complexity with nested conditions
   - Suggestion: Refactor into smaller, focused methods with clear single responsibilities

2. **SECHTMLParser._process_table**
   - Complex table cell processing with tight coupling
   - Suggestion: Extract cell processing to a dedicated class with clear interface

### Duplication
1. **Style parsing logic**
   - Similar parsing logic in multiple files
   - Suggestion: Consolidate style parsing into a unified module

2. **Text normalization**
   - Multiple text normalization methods with similar functionality
   - Suggestion: Create a TextNormalizer utility class

### Performance
1. **Deep recursion**
   - Recursive element processing without depth limits
   - Suggestion: Add depth tracking and limits to prevent stack overflows

2. **Repeated style parsing**
   - No caching for repeated style parsing
   - Suggestion: Implement LRU cache for parsed styles by element ID

## Recommendations

### Architecture
1. Formalize node visitor pattern for operations on document structure
2. Create dedicated NodeFactory class to encapsulate node creation logic
3. Consider splitting large parser class into specialized parsers by content type

### Code Quality
1. Refactor complex methods into smaller, focused functions
2. Add comprehensive docstrings to all public methods
3. Add type guards for complex type unions

### Performance
1. Implement strategic caching for style parsing and heading detection
2. Add depth limits to recursive methods
3. Consider lazy parsing for large sections like tables

### Testing
1. Add property-based testing for style inheritance
2. Create test fixtures for complex document structures
3. Add performance benchmarks for parsing large documents

## Usage Examples

### Basic Document Parsing
```python
import requests
from edgar.files.html import Document

# Get HTML content from a filing
html_content = requests.get("https://www.sec.gov/filing/example").text

# Parse into document structure
document = Document.parse(html_content)

# Access document nodes
for node in document.nodes:
    print(f"Node type: {node.type}")
    if node.type == 'heading':
        print(f"Heading: {node.content}")
```

### Extracting Tables from a Document
```python
from edgar.files.html import Document
import pandas as pd

document = Document.parse(html_content)

# Extract all tables
tables = document.tables

# Convert to pandas DataFrames for analysis
dataframes = []
for table_node in tables:
    # Access the processed table
    processed = table_node._processed
    if processed:
        # Create DataFrame with headers and data
        df = pd.DataFrame(processed.data_rows, columns=processed.headers)
        dataframes.append(df)
```

### Converting Document to Markdown
```python
from edgar.files.html import Document

document = Document.parse(html_content)

# Convert to markdown
markdown_text = document.to_markdown()

# Save to file
with open("filing.md", "w") as f:
    f.write(markdown_text)
```

### Accessing XBRL Data in Document Nodes
```python
from edgar.files.html import Document

document = Document.parse(html_content)

# Find nodes with XBRL facts
xbrl_facts = []
for node in document.nodes:
    if 'ix_tag' in node.metadata and 'ix_context' in node.metadata:
        xbrl_facts.append({
            'concept': node.metadata['ix_tag'],
            'context': node.metadata['ix_context'],
            'value': node.content,
        })
        
# Process extracted facts
for fact in xbrl_facts:
    print(f"{fact['concept']}: {fact['value']}")
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Heading Detection Issues

During testing, we discovered that headings in some filings (such as Oracle 10-K) are not properly detected by the underlying Document class, which prevents proper item identification. This is a critical issue that needs addressing in the implementation.

Potential causes:
- Heading detection in the Document class may be too strict
- Some filings use non-standard formatting for headings
- Style inheritance might not be working correctly
- Heading level determination may not account for all possible cases

Possible solutions:
1. Add a fallback mechanism that uses regex-based item detection when structural detection fails
2. Implement a hybrid approach that combines structural and textual analysis
3. Create specialized detectors for specific filing types that account for their unique structures
4. Add more signals to the heading detection (e.g., positional info, surrounding context)

**Priority:** High - This issue directly impacts the core functionality of extracting items from filings.
