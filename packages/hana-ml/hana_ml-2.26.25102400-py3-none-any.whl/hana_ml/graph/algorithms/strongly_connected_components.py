class StronglyConnectedComponents(AlgorithmBase):
    """
    Identifies the strongly connected components of a graph.

    A directed graph is called strongly connected if each of its vertices
    is reachable of every other ones.
    Being strongly connected is an equivalence relation and therefore
    the strongly connected components (scc) of the graph form a partition
    on the vertex set.

    The induced subgraphs on these subsets are the strongly connected
    components. Note, that each vertex of the graph is part of exactly
    one scc, but not every edge is part of any scc (if yes, then in only
    one scc).

    In case each scc contains only one vertex, the graph is a directed
    acyclic graph, as in all strongly connected graphs there should
    exist a cycle on all of its vertices.

    The calculation is started by calling :func:`~execute`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import hana_ml.graph.algorithms as hga
    >>> scc = hga.StronglyConnectedComponents(graph=g).execute()
    >>> print("Vertices", scc.vertices)
    >>> print("Components", scc.components)
    >>> print("Number of Components", scc.components_count)
