    Within Cumulocity a managed object is used to hold virtually any
    *additional* (apart from measurements, events and alarms) information.

    of any structure.

    Fragments are modelled as standard Python fields and can be accessed
    directly if the names & structures are known:

        x = mo.c8y_CustomFragment.values.x

    Managed objects can be changed and such updates are written as

    differences automatically - just use the ManagedObject class like
    any other Python class.

    like
