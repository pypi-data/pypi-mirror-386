                are ignored if this is provided
            query (str):  Complex query to execute; all other filters are
                ignored if such a custom query is provided
            ids (List[str|int]): Specific object ID to select.
            order_by (str):  Field/expression to sort the results.
            type (str):  Managed object type
            parent (str):  Parent object in the asset hierarchy (ID).
            fragment (str):  Name of a present custom/standard fragment
            fragments (list[str]): Additional fragments present within objects
            name (str):  Name of the managed object
                Note: The Cumulocity REST API does not support filtering for
                names directly; this is a convenience parameter which will
                translate all filters into a query string.
            owner (str):  Username of the object owner
            text (str): Text value of any object property.
            only_roots (bool): Whether to include only objects that don't have
                any parent
            with_children (bool):  Whether children with ID and name should be
                included with each returned object
            with_children_count (bool): When set to true, the returned result
                will contain the total number of children in the respective
                child additions, assets and devices sub fragments.
            skip_children_names (bool):  If true, returned references of child
                devices won't contain their names.
            with_groups (bool): Whether to include additional information about
                the groups to which the searched managed object belongs to.
                This results in setting the assetParents property with
                additional information about the groups.
            with_parents (bool): Whether to include a device's parents.
            with_latest_values (bool):  If true the platform includes the
                fragment `c8y_LatestMeasurements, which contains the latest
                measurement values reported by the device to the platform.
            limit (int): Limit the number of results to this number.
            include (str | JsonMatcher): Matcher/expression to filter the query
                results (on client side). The inclusion is applied first.
                Creates a PyDF (Python Display Filter) matcher by default for strings.
            exclude (str | JsonMatcher): Matcher/expression to filter the query
                results (on client side). The exclusion is applied second.
                Creates a PyDF (Python Display Filter) matcher by default for strings.
            page_size (int): Define the number of events which are read (and
                parsed in one chunk). This is a performance related setting.
            page_number (int): Pull a specific page; this effectively disables
                automatic follow-up page retrieval.
            as_values: (*str|tuple):  Don't parse objects, but directly extract
                the values at certain JSON paths as tuples; If the path is not
                defined in a result, None is used; Specify a tuple to define
                a proper default value for each path.

            ids (List[str|int]): Specific object ID to select.
            type (str):  Device type
            parent (str):  Parent object in the asset hierarchy (ID).
            order_by (str):  Field/expression to sort the results.
            fragment (str):  Name of a present custom/standard fragment
            fragments (list[str]): Additional fragments present within objects
            name (str):  Name of the device
                Note: The Cumulocity REST API does not support filtering for
                names directly; this is a convenience parameter which will
                translate all filters into a query string.
            owner (str):  Username of the object owner
            text (str): Text value of any object property.
            only_roots (bool): Whether to include only objects that don't have

            with_groups (bool): Whether to include additional information about
                the groups to which the searched managed object belongs to.
                This results in setting the assetParents property with

                fragment `c8y_LatestMeasurements, which contains the latest
                measurement values reported by the device to the platform.
            limit (int): Limit the number of results to this number.
            include (str | JsonMatcher): Matcher/expression to filter the query
                results (on client side). The inclusion is applied first.
                Creates a PyDF (Python Display Filter) matcher by default for strings.
            exclude (str | JsonMatcher): Matcher/expression to filter the query
                results (on client side). The exclusion is applied second.
                Creates a PyDF (Python Display Filter) matcher by default for strings.
            page_size (int): Define the number of events which are read (and
                parsed in one chunk). This is a performance related setting.
            page_number (int): Pull a specific page; this effectively disables
                automatic follow-up page retrieval.
            as_values: (*str|tuple):  Don't parse objects, but directly extract
                the values at certain JSON paths as tuples; If the path is not
                defined in a result, None is used; Specify a tuple to define

        """ Select device groups by various parameters.

        This is a lazy implementation; results are fetched in pages but
        parsed and returned one by one.

        Args:
            expression (str):  Arbitrary filter expression which will be
                passed to Cumulocity without change; all other filters
                are ignored if this is provided
            query (str):  Complex query to execute; all other filters are
                ignored if such a custom query is provided
            ids (List[str|int]): Specific object ID to select
            order_by (str):  Field/expression to sort the results.
            fragment (str):  Name of a present custom/standard fragment
            fragments (list[str]): Additional fragments present within objects
            type (bool):  Filter for root or child groups respectively.
                Note: If set to None, no type filter will be applied which
                will match all kinds of managed objects. If you want to
                match device groups only you need to use the fragment filter.
            parent (str):  Parent object in the asset hierarchy (ID).
                Note: this sets the `type` filter to be c8y_DeviceSubGroup
                if not defined; Like the `name` parameter, this is a
                convenience parameter which will translate all filters into
                a query string.
            fragment (str): Additional fragment present within the objects
            fragments (list[str]): Additional fragments present within the objects
            name (str): Name string of the groups to select
                Note:  he Cumulocity REST API does not support filtering for
                names directly; this is a convenience parameter which will
                translate all filters into a query string.
                No partial matching/patterns are supported
            owner (str): Username of the group owner
            text (str): Text value of any object property.
            only_roots (bool): Whether to include only objects that don't have
                any parent
            with_children (bool):  Whether children with ID and name should be
                included with each returned object
            with_children_count (bool): When set to true, the returned result
                will contain the total number of children in the respective
                child additions, assets and devices sub fragments.
            skip_children_names (bool):  If true, returned references of child
                devices won't contain their names.
            with_groups (bool): Whether to include additional information about
                the groups to which the searched managed object belongs to.
                This results in setting the assetParents property with
                additional information about the groups.
            with_parents (bool): Whether to include a device's parents.
            with_latest_values (bool):  If true the platform includes the
                fragment `c8y_LatestMeasurements, which contains the latest
                measurement values reported by the device to the platform.
            limit (int): Limit the number of results to this number.
            include (str | JsonMatcher): Matcher/expression to filter the query
                results (on client side). The inclusion is applied first.
                Creates a PyDF (Python Display Filter) matcher by default for strings.
            exclude (str | JsonMatcher): Matcher/expression to filter the query
                results (on client side). The exclusion is applied second.
                Creates a PyDF (Python Display Filter) matcher by default for strings.
            page_size (int): Define the number of events which are read (and
                parsed in one chunk). This is a performance related setting.
            page_number (int): Pull a specific page; this effectively disables
                automatic follow-up page retrieval.
            as_values: (*str|tuple):  Don't parse objects, but directly extract
                the values at certain JSON paths as tuples; If the path is not
                defined in a result, None is used; Specify a tuple to define
                a proper default value for each path.

        Returns:
            Generator of DeviceGroup instances
