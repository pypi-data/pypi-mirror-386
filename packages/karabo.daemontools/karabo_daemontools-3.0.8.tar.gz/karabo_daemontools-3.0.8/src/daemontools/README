daemontools-encore is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services.
It is derived from the public-domain release of daemontools by D. J.
Bernstein, which can be found at http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html

daemontools-encore adds numerous enhancements above what daemontools
could do while maintaining backwards compatibility with daemontools.
See the CHANGES file for more details on what features have been added.

I realize there are other supervisory systems that will handle some or
all of the tasks that this package does better.  I am providing this
package as a service to those who prefer the semantics and handling that
daemontools provides.

Official release can be found at:

Development versions are available from github:
