'''
The SpatialAnalysis class serves a unifying class FOR THE nonGUI API coordinating all the spatial functions/methods in PalmettoBUG 
IT IS NOT USED IN THE GUI AT PRESENT! Instead, the individual spatial classes are called by the GUI. These were made firstm
before the coordinating class, which is why there is a disconnect between the implementation in the GUI and outside it.

class SpatialAnalysis:
    '''
    This class serves as a coordinating class for the three spatial analysis sub-classes. In the GUI, these subclasses are currently called directly (for historical reasons
    and because there is no real reason to update that). However, for use of PalmettoBUG in scripting outside the GUI, it is convenient to have a unified class where all the 
    spatial methods can be accessed.

    The methods of this class are wrappers on methods of the 3 subclasses. Because of this, it can be divided into a number of groupings:

        >>> add data, cell maps, neighbors, neighborhoods, spaceANOVA, and edt    (in order)

    Args:
        (None) -- the key set-up steps in this class are called in the methods of this class, not when it is initialized

    Key Attributes:
        exp:
            This is the connected Analysis object, containing the anndata (exp.data) which holds most of the data used for calculations

        SpaceANOVA, neighbors, edt:
            These are subclasses that contain the actual methods used by this higher-level class. The methods of this class
            are all wrappers on methods contained in one of these sub-classes.

        '''
        Calculates Ripley's spatial statistics for every celltype-celltype pair in clustering in every image. The necessary first step in the SpaceANOVA analysis
        pipeline.

        Args:
            clustering (string): 
                the name of the column in self.exp.data.obs to use for grouping cells into cell types. Usually one of the standard clustering column names 
                ("merging", "metaclustering", etc.).

            max / min / step (integers): 
                these are the integers that determine at which radii statistics will be calculated. An easy to see what those radii will be is

                    >>> list(range(min, max, step))

                The default looks at the range 10-100 with a step size of 1. The min is set to be > 0 because the first few radii should essentiall always have
                zero cell interactions in them. This is because we calculate using cell centroids, so even if two cells directly touch, the first few radii will 
                still not have an interaction. For example, if a perfectly circular cell has a diameter of 10, then only radii > 5 will even have a change of encountered 
                another cell since radii < 5 will only search space INSIDE the cell. And even once the earch radius is outside the cell, it does not count as an 
                interaction when it touches another cell -- it only is counted when it touches the centroid of the other cell. 
                Because of this, usually radii < 10 or so have almost no interaction and therefore very unusual behaviour, and might be best dropped from the calculations.
            
            condition1 / condition2 (string or None): 
                If both are None (default), then every condition in the dataset is used (and the fANOVAs are multi-comparison). Else if both
                condition1/2 are specificied, they should be unique values in the 'condition' columns of self.exp.data.obs, and the SpaceANOVA analysis will
                only look at those conditions, using pairwise comparisons / ANOVAs.

            threshold (integer): 
                default = 10. If at least of the celltypes in a given celltype-celltype pair has fewer cells than this threshold in a given image, 
                that image will be skipped & no Ripley statistics will be calculated from that image for that celltype-cetype pair. Note that is a given 
                celltype-celltype pair never passes this threshold for any of the images for a given condition, then it will be ignored for that condition. Further, 
                if only one condition (or no conditions) has images that pass the threshold, then an ANOVA for that celltype-celltype pair is impossible and will be 
                skipped. However, even then, the Ripley's statistics that were successfully calculated for that single condition can still be plotted.

            permutations (integer): 
                If greater than zero, than a permutation correction will be applied to the data. This is done by randomizing the celltype labels in an image
                and calculating the average Ripley's K for those randomizations. The average random K for the celltype is then substracted from the calculated Ripley's K 
                for that celltype in that image. This corrected K is than used to calculate Ripley's L / g as normal.
                Permutation correction can slow the calculation substantially, but is almost always recommended as it uses the actual strucutre of the cells in the 
                images to correct the values of the Ripley's statistics. This is a powerful and simple way to correct for holes / inhomogeneities in the tissue.

            seed (integer): 
                This is the random seed used for the SpaceANOVA methods. This includes the random permutations for the permutation correction, but
                also the seeds used plotting error regions and fANOVA. The seeds for plotting & fANOVA can be set separately when calling those functions
                but by default whatever you use here for the seed will be used for those steps as well. 

            center_on_zero (boolean): 
                ONLY with permutation correction (permutations > 0). This determines whether to 'center' Ripley's g on 0 or on 1.
                Ripley's g is unique among the Ripley's statistics in that it is particularly easy to interpret, as its theoretical value in a 
                random point pattern is equal to a straight line at 1, with values above 1 indicating more association between points that expected,
                and value less than 1 indicating less interactions that expected. However, the permutation correction shifts this centerpoint to 1 when 
                the permutation is substracted from the calculated K. Additionally, when this substract is done the shape of K / L will deviate strongly
                from the theoretical shape of those statistic's curves.
                So: 
                If this parameter is True, then this shift is allowed to occur, and g will need to be interpreted as centered on 0.

                    >>> Permutation correction is: K = K_data - K_permutation

                If this paramter is False, then after substracting the permutaiton K, the theoretical K { pi*(r^2) } is added back, which
                shifts the center of g to 1 without changing its shape. This change also restores the shape of the K / L statistics to better match  
                their more usual, monotonically increasing shape

                    >>> Permutation correction is: K = K_data + (K_theoretical - K_permutation)

            silence_zero_warnings (boolean):
                this method generates a large number of zero division errors, even in a normal run. By default these are silenced. 

            suppress_threshold_warnings (boolean):
                If True, will not print warnings about images failing to meet cell number thresholds

        Args:
            pixel_classifier_folder (str): 
                the path to a PalmettoBUG-generated pixel classifier folder. This folder needs to contain a subfolder of .tiffs
                containing the pixel class predictions (see maps argument), and contain a biological_labels.csv indicating what the biological
                names of each class in the classifier are.
                When a pixel classifier with > 1 predicted pixel class is used, an edt statistic will be calculated separately for each and added to
                self.exp.data

            masks_folder (str): 
                the path to a folder containing a set of .tiff files of cell segmentation masks. These .tiffs should match those in 
                f'{pixel_classifier_folder}/{maps}'.

                should be either "/classification_maps" or "/merged_classification_maps". This determines which subfolder from pixel_classifier_folder
                that contains the .tiff files of the pixel classification maps to usea for calculating the distance from. The filenames of these .tiffs
                should match those in masks_folder

            smoothing (int): 
                If == 0, no smoothing is performed. Otherwise this indicates the size of isolated pixel class regions to smooth out before
                calculating distances. As in, if smoothing == 10 (default) regions of a pixel class smaller than 10 pixels will be dropped and "smoothed"
                into the surrounding pixel classes using mode-based fill-in (the mode of the remaining, closest neighbor pixels will be used to assign the replacement 
                value for dropped pixels). 
                Why smooth? When calculating the distance form a pixel class using the Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT), very small pixel regions can have an outsized
                impact on the final EDT map, so removing spurious / small regions can help clean up the final calculation.

            stat (str): 
                One of "mean", "median", or "minimum". This determines what statistic is read off of each segmentation region when calculating the edt value
                for each cell. The default, "mean", is the most common use, and represents the average distance from the pixel class across the whole cell's spatial
                footprint. "min" means that the calculated value for each cell with just be its minimum distance to the class of interest (its closest point).
                Of note, when "min" is the selected statistic, normalization cannot be performed (see f0ollowing argument). 

            normalized (bool): 
                Whether to normalize (True) or not (False). In this case, normalization means dividing each cell's determined edt value by the average of the 
                image that cell is in. As in, if "median" statistic is selected with normalized = True, each cell's edt value will be:

                    cell_stat = median(cell_edt) / median(image_edt)

                instead of the non-normalized value:

                    cell_stat = median(cell_edt)

                When "mean" is used as a statistic, then the normalization factor is the mean of the image's edt values. Normalization cannot be calculated this way
                with a statistic is "min", and so is ignored (there is no normalization for "min").

                Normalization is useful as it is a way to help correct for the abundance of the pixel class. As in, if one image is 70% within a pixel class (lets say
                the pixel class is for fibrotic regions) its edt distances will be much lower across the image than an image where only 30% of the image is the fibrotic class. 
                This would make all cells - regardless of cell type - in image 1 have much lower edt values than the cells in image 2, which would not be an inaccurate 
                conclusion (the cells in image 1 are genuinely closer to fibrotic regions), but introduces a confounding factor: have the cells moved towards the fibrosis, or 
                has the fibrotic regions expanded?
                Normalization helps address this, in part, as it takes into account the total quantity & positioning of the pixel class in each image when calculating
                the edt value for each cell.

            background (bool): 
                whether to include the 'background' class in the edt calculations (True) or not (False, default). Usually, the background class is ignored,
                because it is not biologically relevant, but in some situations there is effectively no background class / even the background is biologically meaningful.
                For example, if a classifier is trained to identify broad tissue regions in a sample (such as intestinal crypt lumen / epithelia / lamina propia in a 
                colon section), it might be the case that every part of the image falls into one of the pixel classes and there is no 'background'. 
                Because of how supervised classifier's are trained in PalmettoBUG, a background class is always created so this option is useful if that 'background'
                is actually a relevant grouping.

            marker_class (str or None): 
                what marker_class (self.exp.data.var['antigen']) to assign the edt columns when they are added to self.exp.data.X. By default,
                this is "spatial_edt", as it helps the subsequent plottting functions easily find the edt channels while ignoring the other marker_classes.
                However, setting this to "type" / "state" / "none" is also allowed, if you want to perform plots / calculations that combine both the spatial edt
                data and other channels. 

            auto_panel (bool): 
                Whether to automatically add the channels to self.exp.data (True, default), or only to return a panel dataframe (for manually editing
                marker_class, say if you want to assign different edt statistics from a single classifier to different marker_class-es). If False, you will 
                need to manually add the edt data to self.exp.data with self.edt.append_distance_transform(distances_panel = {your edited marker_class panel}).

            output_edt_folder (None, string, or Path): 
                Default is None (no edt map export). If not None, then should be the path where folders of .tiff files can be
                exported. Specifically, the folders used will be the f'{output_edt_folder}_{class_biological_label}' for each class in the classifier.
                The saved .tiff files will be the intermediate Euclidean distances transforms for that class, from which the stats for each cell mask were calculated.

            save_path (None, string, or Path): 
                Default is None (edt valuesa re not saved). If not None, then should be a file path where a csv file can be written.
                This csv will contain the information for all the edt's calculated for the provided pixel classifier / masks pairing. 
                Note that marker_class information will not be saved (that will need to be set again on re-load of the saved edt values)

    from a folder of cell masks and amatching folder of pixel classifications, calculates a distance transform statistic for every cell in the data.
    This list of distance transform statistics can then be easily added to an anndata object containing read outs from the matching cells.

    Args:
        masks_folder (string or Path): the filepath to a folder containing the masks to be used in the calculation

        class_map_folder (string or Path): the filepath to a folder containing the pixel classifications to be used in the calculation

        class_of_interest (integer): (only if do_all_classes == 0) which class to calculate distance transform statistics for

        do_all_classes (integer): either 0 (when only the class_of_interest will be used) or a number indicating how many pixel classes to use from the 
                classifier (the first X classes will have distance transform stats calculated where X = do_all_classes)

        stat (integer): which statistic to calculate -- "mean" will calculate the mean euclidean distance transform value in each mask
                "median" will calculate the median value, and "min" the minimum. 

        normalized (boolean): whether to normalize the results of each mask. Only if stat != "min". As in, instead of reporting the raw
                average euclidean distance transform value within each mask, will report that value divided by the average of the image 
                that mask was in 

                        --> mean(edt_of_mask) / mean(edt_of_image) -- or median / median as the case may be

                this helps reduce the effect of some images containing substantially more of the pixel class

        smoothing (integer): a number indicating a threshold. Isolated regions of pixel class smaller than this number will be "smoothed" out (dropped to 
                zero, then their values replaced by the mode of the remaining, surrounding pixels). Effectively removes small regions in the pixel classification
                with the goal of removing spurious classifications. Particularly can be important for these distance transforms, as even a single isolated pixel in the 
                class of interest can create a large circular region of lower edt values.
                If no smoothing is desired, set this parameter == 0.

        output_edt_folder (None, string, or Path): If not None, then should be a file path to a folder where the edt maps can be exported. If None, edt maps are not exported.

    Returns:
        a list of lists of floats -- each sublist is the spatial transform for the full data for one of the pixel classes in the selected classifier
                if only one class is selected, then this will be a list containing a single sublist -- which will be as long as the data set (one float / distance
                statistic per cell)

        Performs either FlowSOM-based or Leiden-based clustering of cells into cellular neighborhoods.

        Args:
            clustering (str): the cell metadata column (in self.exp.data.obs) used as input for the chosen clustering algorithm. As in, every cells' neighbors for each 
                    category in this metadata column is counted and a % is derived. This % neighboring cell types is tehn passed into the clustering
                    algorithm.

            leiden_or_flowsom (str): One of two strings -- "FlowSOM" or "Leiden" -- determines which algorith m is used to cluster the cells

            n_clusters (int): FLOWSOM only! -- the number of metaclustering to return at the end of the algorithm

            seed (int): random seed for reproducibility

            resolution (float): (leiden only) the resolution of the leiden clustering. High numbers tend to increase the number of cluster found
                    while lower numbers reduce the number of clusters found

            min_dist (float):  (leiden only) the minimum distance for the UMAP performed alongside the leiden clustering (I think this does not effect the leiden, but
                    does affect the UMAP secondary output.)

            n_neighbors (integer): (leiden only) this is used in scanpy.pp.neighbors() call of the %neighboring cell types data, which precedes leiden clustering

            **kwargs: (FlowSOM only) these keyword arguments are passed into the FlowSOM algorithm. arguments like rlen, etc. are commonly used.

        Returns:
            matplotlib.pyplot figure (UMAP for Leiden clustering, Minimum Spanning Tree / "starplot" for FlowSOM)

        Edits-in-place:
            self.exp.data: adds a 'CN' column in self.exp.data.obs, with the calculated cellular neighborhood groupings.
