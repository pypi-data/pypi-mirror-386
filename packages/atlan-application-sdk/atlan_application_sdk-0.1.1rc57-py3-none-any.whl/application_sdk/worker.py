    This class handles the initialization and execution of Temporal workers,
    including their activities, workflows, and module configurations.

    Attributes:
        workflow_client: Client for interacting with Temporal.
        workflow_worker: The Temporal worker instance.
        workflow_activities: List of activity functions.
        workflow_classes: List of workflow classes.
        passthrough_modules: List of module names to pass through.
        max_concurrent_activities: Maximum number of concurrent activities.

    Note:
        This class is designed to be thread-safe when running workers in daemon mode.
        However, care should be taken when modifying worker attributes after initialization.

    Example:
        >>> from application_sdk.worker import Worker
        >>> from my_workflow import MyWorkflow, my_activity
        >>>
        >>> worker = Worker(
