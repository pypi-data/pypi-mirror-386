"""
This file contains the relational implementation for a "project". This is our
relational representation for a "calculate" that involves any compute steps and can include
adding or removing columns (as well as technically reordering). In general, we seek to
avoid introducing extra nodes just to reorder or prune columns, so ideally their use
should be sparse.
