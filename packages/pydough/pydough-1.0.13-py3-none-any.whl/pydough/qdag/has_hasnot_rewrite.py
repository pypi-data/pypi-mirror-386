    """
    Recursively transforms a PyDough expression QDAG node to achieve the
    following goals:
    - Flatten all conjunctions, e.g. `(x & y) & (a & b) -> (x & y & a & b)`
    - Rewrite all `HAS(X)` as `COUNT(X) > 0` unless in the conjunction of a
    `WHERE` clause.
    - Rewrite all `HASNOT(X)` as `COUNT(X) == 0` unless in the conjunction of a
    `WHERE` clause.

    Args:
        - `exp`: the PyDough expression node being transformed.
        - `allow_has_hasnot`: whether the call is being done in the conjunction
        of a `WHERE` clause, meaning that `HAS` and `HASNOT` should not be
        rewritten. This should only be True when the original callsite is a
        `WHERE` clause.

    Returns:
        The transformed PyDough expression QDAG node.
