## üìã Usage Tips

> [!TIP]
> - **Activation**: Simply prefix your request with the act name or index number (e.g., "31: Design a user-friendly form" or "UX/UI Developer: Design a user-friendly form")
> - **Placeholders**: When you see placeholders like `{position}` or `{language}`, replace them with specific values (e.g., use "Software Engineer" instead of "{position}")
> - **Customization**: You can modify prompts to better suit your specific needs
> - **Combining**: Try combining different personas for complex tasks (e.g., "Act as both a UX Designer and Technical Writer to create documentation for a new interface")
> - **Persistence**: Once activated, a persona will remain active until you change it or end the conversation
