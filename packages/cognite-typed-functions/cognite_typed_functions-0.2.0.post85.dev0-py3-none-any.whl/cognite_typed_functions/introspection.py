"""Core introspection endpoints as a composable app.

This module provides introspection capabilities as a separate FunctionApp that can be
composed with other apps. The introspection app provides endpoints for discovering,
debugging, and monitoring Cognite Functions applications at runtime.

Key Features:
    - Clean separation: Introspection is its own FunctionApp using standard decorators
    - Composed route access: Can introspect routes from all composed apps
    - Standard composition: Works with create_function_service(introspection_app, app)
    - Optional inclusion: Users can choose whether to include introspection endpoints

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from cognite_typed_functions import FunctionApp, create_function_service
    from cognite_typed_functions.introspection import create_introspection_app

    # Create apps
    introspection_app = create_introspection_app()
    app = FunctionApp("My API", "1.0.0")

    @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
    def get_item(client: CogniteClient, item_id: int) -> dict:
        return {"id": item_id, "name": "Widget"}

    # Compose apps - put introspection first to see all other apps
    handle = create_function_service(introspection_app, app)

    # Available endpoints:
    # GET /__schema__ -> OpenAPI schema including /items/{item_id}
    # GET /__routes__ -> List of all routes from all apps
    # GET /__health__ -> Health status and statistics
    # GET /__ping__ -> Connectivity check
    ```

Introspection Endpoints:
    /__schema__ (GET): Returns OpenAPI-compatible schema describing all routes and data models
    /__routes__ (GET): Lists all registered routes with their methods and descriptions
    /__health__ (GET): Provides application health status and basic metrics
    /__ping__ (GET): Simple connectivity check endpoint (useful for MCP and monitoring)

Architecture:
    1. Introspection app handles /__* routes using standard decorators
    2. Overrides set_composition_context() to receive composition context
    3. Generates schemas and route information for all apps in composition
    4. Works seamlessly with MCP and main apps in composed applications
