## Executive Summary

This document tracks the production readiness of all 44 strategies (28 node + 16 edge) in the xwnode library. Each strategy must pass ALL checklist items before being marked production-ready.

**Current Status:** ⚠️ IN PROGRESS

---

## Production Readiness Criteria

Each strategy MUST satisfy ALL 10 criteria:

1. ✅ **Implements Interface Completely** - All methods from iNodeStrategy/iEdgeStrategy implemented
2. ✅ **Extends Abstract Base Class** - Properly extends ANodeStrategy/AEdgeStrategy
3. ⏳ **Security Measures Implemented** - Input validation, bounds checking, path security
4. ⏳ **Performance Benchmarked** - Meets claims in defs.py metadata
5. ⏳ **Error Handling Comprehensive** - All edge cases handled with clear errors
6. ⏳ **Documentation Complete** - File header, docstrings, API docs
7. ⏳ **Tests Passing at 100%** - All strategy-specific tests pass
8. ✅ **Code Follows DEV_GUIDELINES.md** - Naming, structure, patterns
