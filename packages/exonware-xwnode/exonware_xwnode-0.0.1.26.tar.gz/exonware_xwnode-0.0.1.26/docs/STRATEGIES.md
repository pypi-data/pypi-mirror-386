## Migration Guide

### Upgrading Between Strategies

**From HashMap → LSM Tree (write-heavy):**
```python
# Before
node = XWNode.from_native(data, mode=NodeMode.HASH_MAP)

# After
node = XWNode.from_native(data, mode=NodeMode.LSM_TREE, options={
    'background_compaction': True,
    'memtable_size': 10000
})
```

**From OrderedMap → AVL Tree (strict balance):**
```python
# Before
node = XWNode.from_native(data, mode=NodeMode.ORDERED_MAP)

# After  
node = XWNode.from_native(data, mode=NodeMode.AVL_TREE)
```

**From Regular → Persistent (immutability):**
```python
# Before
node = XWNode.from_native(data, mode=NodeMode.HASH_MAP)

# After (immutable with version history)
node = XWNode.from_native(data, mode=NodeMode.PERSISTENT_TREE, options={
    'max_versions': 100,
    'retention_policy': 'keep_recent'
})
```

## When NOT to Use Certain Strategies

### Avoid These Combinations

❌ **LSM Tree for read-heavy workloads** → Use AVL/B-Tree instead  
❌ **HashMap for sorted iteration** → Use OrderedMap or AVL Tree  
❌ **Splay Tree for uniform random access** → Use AVL or Red-Black  
❌ **Learned Index for < 100 keys** → Training overhead too high  
❌ **BW Tree in single-threaded** → Use regular B+ Tree  
❌ **Bloom Filter for exact membership** → Use Set Hash instead
