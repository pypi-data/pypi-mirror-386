# 10x Exhaustive Search - Progress Status

## Current Status: READY TO RUN

The 10x exhaustive search is ready to test all 760 combinations at production scale.

**To run:**
```bash
cd xwnode/examples/db_creation_test
python run_exhaustive_search_10x.py
```

**Expected duration:** 2-4 hours  
**Dataset:** 5000 users, 3000 posts, 2000 comments, 10000 relationships  
**Total operations per config:** ~50,000

## What to Expect

Based on our previous 6-config 10x test, here are the expectations:

### Predicted Top 5 (10x Scale):
1. **B_TREE + ADJ_LIST** (~350ms)
2. **CUCKOO_HASH + CSR** (~340ms) - 1x champion
3. **LSM_TREE + DYNAMIC_ADJ_LIST** (~330ms)
4. **QUERY-OPTIMIZED configs** (~360ms)
5. **PERSISTENT_TREE variants** (~370ms)

### Will Scale Change the Winner?

**1x Champion:** CUCKOO_HASH + CSR (1.60ms)  
**10x Champion:** TBD

**Key question:** Does CUCKOO_HASH scale linearly, or do cache-friendly structures take over?

## How to Monitor Progress

Once running, the script will:
- Report progress every 25 combinations
- Show current leader
- Display success rate
- Save results incrementally

**Files to watch:**
- `exhaustive_search_results_10x.json` - Growing results file
- `EXHAUSTIVE_SEARCH_RESULTS_10X.md` - Final report (generated at end)
