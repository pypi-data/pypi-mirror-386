# Nexus Proto

Shared Protocol Buffer definitions for Nexus microservices.

## Why "Nexus"?

The name **Nexus** was chosen to represent the **central connection** between microservices. In many languages, "nexus" refers to a point of intersection or link, which is exactly what this project provides: an efficient hub for communication between distributed services built in different technologies. The idea is to create a convergence point that makes it easier to integrate systems, ensuring consistent and scalable communication, no matter the language or framework used. **Nexus** is the solution that connects and unites services in a simple and effective way.

## Features

- **Centralized Protocol Definitions**: All communication contracts are defined in a shared repository of `.proto` files.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Easily integrate microservices written in different programming languages (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java, etc.).
- **Scalable Communication**: Easily extend the system as new microservices are added to the architecture.
- **gRPC-powered**: Leveraging gRPC for high-performance communication with built-in support for multiple programming languages.
