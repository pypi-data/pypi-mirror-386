 * Tests cover:
 * - Component exports and structure
 * - DisplayName and memo wrapping
 * - Basic prop validation

/**
 * Integration tests for ChartContainer are performed in the full application
 * context where React 19 concurrent features work properly.
 *
 * Known limitations in test environment:
 * - useTransition causes infinite loops in vitest
 * - flushSync from react-dom doesn't work with JSDOM
 * - ErrorBoundary adds async complexity
 *
 * Alternative testing approaches:
 * 1. E2E tests with real browser environment
 * 2. Storybook interaction tests
 * 3. Manual testing with Streamlit integration
