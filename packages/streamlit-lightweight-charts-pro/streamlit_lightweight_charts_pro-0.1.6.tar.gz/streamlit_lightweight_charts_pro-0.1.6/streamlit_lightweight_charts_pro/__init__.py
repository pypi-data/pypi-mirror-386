"""Streamlit Lightweight Charts Pro - Professional Financial Charting Library.

A comprehensive Python library for creating interactive financial charts in Streamlit
applications. Built on top of TradingView's Lightweight Charts library, this package
provides a fluent API for building sophisticated financial visualizations with
method chaining support.

Key Features:
    - Multiple chart types: Line, Candlestick, Area, Bar, Histogram, Baseline
    - Advanced series: Band, Ribbon, Gradient Ribbon, Trend Fill, Signal
    - Comprehensive annotation system with text, arrows, and shapes
    - Trade visualization with buy/sell markers and trade lines
    - Multi-pane chart support with synchronized time scales
    - Pandas DataFrame integration for easy data import
    - Fluent API design for intuitive method chaining
    - Type-safe data models with validation

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro import Chart, LineSeries, create_text_annotation
    from streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro.data import SingleValueData

    # Create data
    data = [SingleValueData("2024-01-01", 100), SingleValueData("2024-01-02", 105)]

    # Method 1: Direct chart creation
    chart = Chart(series=LineSeries(data, color="#ff0000"))
    chart.render(key="my_chart")

    # Method 2: Fluent API with method chaining
    chart = (
        Chart()
        .add_series(LineSeries(data, color="#ff0000"))
        .update_options(height=400)
        .add_annotation(create_text_annotation("2024-01-01", 100, "Start"))
    )
    chart.render(key="my_chart")
    ```

    This function verifies that the required frontend assets exist for

    where the package is installed with the `-e` flag used.

    The function performs the following checks:
        1. Determines if the package is installed in development mode
        2. Verifies the package location matches the current module location
        3. Checks for the existence of frontend build artifacts

    Returns:
        None: This function has no return value, it warns if frontend is missing.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If importlib.metadata is not available.
        OSError: If file system operations fail during path checking.
