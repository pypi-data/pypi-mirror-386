"""Marker data classes for Streamlit Lightweight Charts Pro.

This module provides data classes for chart markers used to highlight
specific data points or events on charts, following the TradingView Lightweight Charts API.
The module includes different types of markers for various positioning scenarios.

The module includes:
    - MarkerBase: Base class for all chart markers
    - PriceMarker: Marker positioned at exact price levels
    - BarMarker: Marker positioned relative to bars
    - Marker: Backward compatibility alias for BarMarker

Key Features:
    - Automatic time normalization to UNIX timestamps
    - Position validation for different marker types
    - Shape and color customization
    - Optional text and ID fields
    - Size control for marker appearance
    - Enum-based position and shape validation

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro.data import Marker, PriceMarker
    from streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro.type_definitions.enums import MarkerPosition, MarkerShape

    # Create bar marker
    bar_marker = Marker(
        time="2024-01-01T00:00:00",
        position=MarkerPosition.ABOVE_BAR,
        shape=MarkerShape.CIRCLE,
        color="#FF0000",
        text="Important Event",
    )

    # Create price marker
    price_marker = PriceMarker(
        time="2024-01-01T00:00:00",
        position=MarkerPosition.AT_PRICE_TOP,
        shape=MarkerShape.ARROW_DOWN,
        price=100.0,
        color="#00FF00",
    )
    ```

class MarkerBase(Data):
    """Base chart marker definition for highlighting data points.

    This class represents the base marker that can be displayed on charts to
    highlight specific data points, events, or annotations. Based on the
    TradingView Lightweight Charts SeriesMarkerBase interface, it provides
    the foundation for all marker types in the library.

    The class automatically handles time normalization, position and shape
    validation, and provides a flexible interface for marker customization.

    Attributes:
        time (int): UNIX timestamp in seconds representing the marker time.
            This value is automatically normalized during initialization.
        position (Union[str, MarkerPosition]): Where to position the marker
            relative to the data point. Can be a string or MarkerPosition enum.
            Defaults to ABOVE_BAR.
        shape (Union[str, MarkerShape]): Shape of the marker. Can be a string
            or MarkerShape enum. Defaults to CIRCLE.
        color (str): Color of the marker in hex format. Defaults to "#2196F3" (blue).
        id (Optional[str]): Optional unique identifier for the marker.
            If not provided, the id field is not serialized.
        text (Optional[str]): Optional text to display with the marker.
            If not provided, the text field is not serialized.
        size (int): Size of the marker in pixels. Defaults to 1.

    Class Attributes:
        REQUIRED_COLUMNS (set): Set containing "position" and "shape" as
            required columns for DataFrame conversion operations.
        OPTIONAL_COLUMNS (set): Set containing optional columns for
            DataFrame conversion operations.

    Example:
        ```python
