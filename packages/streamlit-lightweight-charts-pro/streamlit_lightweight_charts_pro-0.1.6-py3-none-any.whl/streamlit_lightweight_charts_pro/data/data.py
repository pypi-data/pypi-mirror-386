"""Data classes and utilities for Streamlit Lightweight Charts Pro.

This module provides the base data class and utility functions for time format conversion
used throughout the library for representing financial data points. The Data class serves
as the foundation for all chart data structures, providing standardized serialization
and time normalization capabilities.

The module includes:
    - Data: Abstract base class for all chart data points
    - classproperty: Descriptor for creating class-level properties
    - Column management utilities for DataFrame conversion
    - Time normalization and serialization utilities

Key Features:
    - Automatic time normalization to UNIX timestamps
    - CamelCase serialization for frontend communication
    - NaN handling and NumPy type conversion
    - Column management for DataFrame operations
    - Enum value extraction for serialization

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro.data import Data
    from dataclasses import dataclass


    @dataclass
    class MyData(Data):
        value: float


    # Create data point with automatic time normalization
    data = MyData(time="2024-01-01T00:00:00", value=100.0)

    # Serialize to frontend format
    serialized = data.asdict()  # {'time': 1704067200, 'value': 100.0}
    ```

    """Abstract base class for chart data points.

    All chart data classes should inherit from Data. This class provides the foundation
    for all data structures in the library, handling time normalization, serialization,
    and column management for DataFrame operations.

    Time normalization happens during serialization (asdict()) rather than at construction,
    allowing users to modify time values after creating data objects. This provides
    flexibility while ensuring all serialized data uses consistent UTC timestamps.

    Attributes:
        time (Union[pd.Timestamp, datetime, str, int, float]): Time value in various
            formats. Converted to UTC timestamp during serialization.

    Class Attributes:
        REQUIRED_COLUMNS (set): Set of required column names for DataFrame conversion.
        OPTIONAL_COLUMNS (set): Set of optional column names for DataFrame conversion.

    See also:
        LineData: Single value data points for line charts.
        OhlcData: OHLC data points for candlestick charts.
        OhlcvData: OHLCV data points with volume information.

    Example:
        ```python
        from dataclasses import dataclass
        from streamlit_lightweight_charts_pro.data import Data


        @dataclass
        class MyData(Data):
            value: float


        # Create data point
        data = MyData(time="2024-01-01T00:00:00", value=100.0)

        # Can modify time after construction
        data.time = "2024-01-02T00:00:00"

        # Serialize for frontend (time normalized here)
        serialized = data.asdict()  # {'time': <normalized_timestamp>, 'value': 100.0}
        ```

    Note:
        - All imports must be at the top of the file unless justified.
        - Use specific exceptions and lazy string formatting for logging.
        - Time values are normalized to UTC timestamps during serialization.
        - NaN values are converted to 0.0 for frontend compatibility.
