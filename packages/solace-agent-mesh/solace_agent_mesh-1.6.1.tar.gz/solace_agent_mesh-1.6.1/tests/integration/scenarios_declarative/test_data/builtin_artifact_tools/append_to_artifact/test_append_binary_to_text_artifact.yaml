test_case_id: "builtin_append_binary_to_text_artifact_001"
description: |
  Tests appending a binary chunk (base64 encoded) to a pre-existing text artifact.
  Verifies that the original artifact's text MIME type is preserved,
  and the new content includes both original text and appended binary data.
