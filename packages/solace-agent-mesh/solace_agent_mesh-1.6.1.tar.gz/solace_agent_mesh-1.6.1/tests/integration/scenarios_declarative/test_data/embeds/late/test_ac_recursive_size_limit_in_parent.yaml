# Gateway config for this test (via fixture override or specific test setup):
# gateway_max_artifact_resolve_size_bytes: 50 (or a low value)
# This test is hard to make fully declarative without per-test gateway config.
# It will demonstrate successful resolution if the default size limit (100MB) is active.
# A programmatic test is better for precise limit testing.
# This YAML will assume the default limit is large enough.
