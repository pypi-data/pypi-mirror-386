# Orchestrator Agent

The A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol is the communication backbone of Agent Mesh that enables distributed agent coordination and workflow management. Unlike traditional centralized orchestration, the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other, delegate tasks, and collaborate directly through standardized message patterns.

The advantages of centralized orchestration such as task breakdown and management, centralized point of communication and session management are still achieved in Agent Mesh through a specialized agent called the **OrchestratorAgent** that acts as the central coordinator for complex workflows.



:::tip[In one sentence]
The OrchestratorAgent allows for a centralized workflow management in Agent Mesh by coordinating tasks and communication between agents.

The system is not limited to a single orchestrator agent, and multiple orchestrator agents can be deployed to handle different workflows or domains. This allows for flexibility and scalability in managing complex tasks.

## Key Functions

The orchestrator agent provides the following key functions:

1. **Request Analysis and Action Planning**:

   - Receives high-level goals or requests
   - Analyzes them in the context of available actions registered by agents in the system
   - Uses state-of-the-art generative AI techniques to plan a sequence of actions to fulfill the request

2. **Task Creation and Distribution**:

   - Creates tasks based on the action plan
   - Distributes tasks to appropriate agents
   - Enables efficient parallel processing and optimal resource utilization

3. **Workflow Management**:

   - Tracks outstanding tasks
   - Aggregates responses from various agents
   - Ensures all parts of a complex request are processed and combined coherently

4. **Response Formatting**:
   - Formats aggregated responses suitable for the gateway
   - Ensures the final output meets the requirements of the specific use case or interface
