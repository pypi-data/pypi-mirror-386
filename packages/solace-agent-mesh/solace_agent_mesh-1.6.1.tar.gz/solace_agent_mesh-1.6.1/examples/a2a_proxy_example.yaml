      # Configuration for the artifact service used by the proxy itself.

      # store it here before forwarding it on the Solace mesh.

      # --- List of Downstream Agents to Proxy ---
      # A single proxy can manage multiple external agents.
      # Each agent can have its own URL, authentication, and timeout settings.
      proxied_agents:
        # Example 1: A simple agent without authentication
        - name: "HelloWorld" # The name this agent will have on the Solace mesh
          url: "http://localhost:9999" # The real HTTP endpoint of the agent
        
        # Example 2: Another agent without authentication
        - name: "AnalysisAgent"
          url: "http://127.0.0.1:10001"
        
        # You can add more agents here with different configurations:
        # - name: "SecureAgent"
        #   url: "https://api.example.com/agent"
        #   authentication:
        #     type: "static_bearer"
        #     token: "${SECURE_AGENT_TOKEN}"
        #   request_timeout_seconds: 180
