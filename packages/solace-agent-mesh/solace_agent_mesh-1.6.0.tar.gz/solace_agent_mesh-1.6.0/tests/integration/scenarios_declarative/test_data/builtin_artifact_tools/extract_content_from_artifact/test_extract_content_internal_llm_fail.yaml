  # Interaction 2: This is the mocked *failed* response for the *internal* LLM call

  # We simulate an error from the LLM (e.g., by returning an error in the response or an empty/malformed one).
  # For simplicity, let's make the LLM return an error message as its content.
  # The tool's error handling for LLM calls should catch this.

    static_response:
      # Simulate an LLM error by having it return an error-like message or an empty response.
      # The actual tool code logs an exception if the LLM call itself raises one.
      # Here, we'll mock the LLM returning a text that indicates failure.
      # A more direct way to test the exception path would be to modify TestLLMServer to raise an exception.
      # For declarative, we mock the *response* from the LLM.
      # Let's assume the LLM call itself succeeds but returns an error message in its content.
      # The tool code currently checks `if not extracted_content_str.strip(): log.warning(...)`
      # and `except Exception as e: log.exception(...)` around the LLM call.
      # To trigger the `error_extraction_failed` due to an exception *during* the LLM call,
      # the TestLLMServer would need to be configured to raise an error for this specific request.
      # Since we can't do that declaratively, we'll mock a response that the tool *should* treat as a failure.
      # The current tool code returns `error_extraction_failed` if `chosen_llm.generate_content_async` raises an exception.
      # Let's assume the TestLLMServer can be primed to return a response that causes an issue,
      # or the tool's logic for "empty" response is robust.
      # The example `test_extract_content_simple_text.yaml` has the internal LLM returning `content: "brown"`.
      # If the internal LLM returns an empty content or an error structure, the tool should handle it.
      # Let's make the internal LLM return an empty content, which the tool should log as a warning
      # but might not immediately translate to "error_extraction_failed" unless the goal implies non-empty.
      #
      # A better way to test this specific path ("Internal LLM call for extraction failed: {e}")
      # would be to have the TestLLMServer itself raise an exception when it receives this specific
      # internal request. This is harder to model declaratively without special TestLLMServer features.
      #
      # For now, let's assume the internal LLM returns an empty string, and the tool's logic
      # around `if not extracted_content_str.strip():` handles this gracefully, but the *overall*
      # task might still be considered a failure by the outer LLM if it expected something.
      #
      # To truly test `status: "error_extraction_failed"` due to an LLM exception,
      # we'd need a way for the declarative test to tell the TestLLMServer to *raise an error*
      # for this specific internal call.
      #
      # Let's adjust the test: the internal LLM returns a response that *simulates* an error
      # that the `extract_content_from_artifact` tool's error handling for its LLM call would catch.
      # The tool code has: `extracted_content_str = f"[ERROR: Asynchronous LLM call failed: {llm_async_err}]"`
      # So, we can have the internal LLM return a content that starts with "[ERROR:"
