description: |
  Tests 'extract_content_from_artifact' where extracted content is large enough
  to be saved, but small enough to be fully returned to the LLM without truncation.
  Assumes save_threshold_bytes=50, llm_return_max_bytes=200.

# This test relies on the host component config being:
# tool_output_save_threshold_bytes: 50
# tool_output_llm_return_max_bytes: 200
