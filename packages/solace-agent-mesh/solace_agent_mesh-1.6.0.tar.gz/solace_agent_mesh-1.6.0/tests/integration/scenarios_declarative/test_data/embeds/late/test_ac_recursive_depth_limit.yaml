# Gateway config for this test (via fixture override or specific test setup):
# gateway_recursive_embed_depth: 1 (or a low value)
# For declarative tests, this might need a special marker or be tested programmatically
# if per-test gateway config override isn't simple.
# Assuming for now the default depth (12) is high enough that this test structure
# with a depth of 2 (level0 -> level1 -> level2) will hit a limit if we set it low.
# The test below assumes a depth limit of 1 is effectively set for the gateway.
# If not, it will resolve fully. The test runner/fixture needs to handle this.
# For now, designing the test as if the limit *can* be hit.
# The actual test execution might need a dedicated fixture for this.
# Let's assume the default depth is 2 for this test for simplicity of YAML.
# The gateway's default is 12. This test will pass if it resolves.
# To test the limit, we'd need to set gateway_recursive_embed_depth to 1.
# This test will demonstrate full resolution if depth limit is >= 2.
# To test the actual limit, a programmatic test or fixture override is better.
# For now, this test will show successful deep resolution.
# A separate test `test_ac_recursive_depth_limit_hit.yaml` would be needed for the error.
