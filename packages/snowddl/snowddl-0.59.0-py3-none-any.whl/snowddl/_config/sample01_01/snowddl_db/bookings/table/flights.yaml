comment: >-
  The natural key of the bookings.flights table consists of two fields — flight_no and scheduled_departure.
  To make foreign keys for this table more compact, a surrogate key is used as the primary key (flight_id).

  A flight always connects two points — the airport of departure (departure_airport) and arrival (arrival_airport).
  There is no such entity as a “connecting flight”: if there are no non-stop flights from one airport to another, the ticket simply includes several required flight segments.

  Each flight has a scheduled date and time of departure (scheduled_departure) and arrival (scheduled_arrival).
  The actual departure time (actual_departure) and arrival time (actual_arrival) can differ: the difference is usually not very big, but sometimes can be up to several hours if the flight is delayed.
