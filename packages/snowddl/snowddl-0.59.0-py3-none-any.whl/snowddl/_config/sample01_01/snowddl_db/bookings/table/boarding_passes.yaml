  At the time of check-in, which opens twenty-four hours before the scheduled departure, the passenger is issued a boarding pass.
  Like the flight segment, the boarding pass is identified by the ticket number and the flight number.
  Boarding passes are assigned sequential numbers (boarding_no), in the order of check-ins for the flight (this number is unique only within the context of a particular flight).
  The boarding pass specifies the seat number (seat_no).
