SnowDDL is a [declarative-style](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/embracing-agile-software-delivery-and-devops-with-snowflake/) tool for object management automation in [Snowflake](http://snowflake.com).

It is not intended to replace other tools entirely, but to provide an alternative approach focused on practical data engineering challenges.

You may find SnowDDL useful if:

- complexity of object schema grows exponentially, and it becomes hard to manage;
- your organization maintains multiple Snowflake accounts (dev, stage, prod);
- your organization has multiple developers sharing the same Snowflake account and suffering from conflicts;
- it is necessary to generate some part of configuration dynamically using Python;

## Main features

1. SnowDDL is "stateless".
2. SnowDDL can revert any changes.
3. SnowDDL supports ALTER COLUMN.
4. SnowDDL provides built-in "Role hierarchy" model.
5. SnowDDL re-creates invalid views automatically.
6. SnowDDL simplifies code review.
7. SnowDDL supports creation of isolated "environments" for individual developers and CI/CD scripts.
8. SnowDDL strikes a good balance between dependency management overhead and parallelism.
9. SnowDDL configuration can be generated dynamically in Python code.
10. SnowDDL can manage packages for Java and Python UDF scripts natively.
