  A ticket has a unique number (ticket_no) that consists of 13 digits.
  The ticket includes a passenger ID (passenger_id) — the identity document number, — their first and last names (passenger_name), and contact information (contact_data).
  Neither the passenger ID, nor the name is permanent (for example, one can change the last name or passport), so it is impossible to uniquely identify all tickets of a particular passenger.
