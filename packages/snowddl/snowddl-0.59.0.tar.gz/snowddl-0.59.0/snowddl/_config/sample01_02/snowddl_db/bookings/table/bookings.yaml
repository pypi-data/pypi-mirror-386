  Passengers book tickets for themselves, and, possibly, for several other passengers, in advance (book_date, not earlier than one month before the flight).
  The booking is identified by its number (book_ref, a six-position combination of letters and digits).
  The total_amount field stores the total cost of all tickets included into the booking, for all passengers.
