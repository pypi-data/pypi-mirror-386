**Mission:** Our employees go to an assigned store and suggest that you've heard positive things about the new Google Pixel 10 phone and are considering upgrading. When speaking with a store employee, present these three (3) concerns as reasons you might hesitate to switch: 1. Messaging not working well with iPhone/Samsung friends. 2. Pixel’s camera may not be as good as if you upgraded to the most current version of your device. 3. Switching phones is a pain / might lose data
**Background:** Visits are mystery shopper evaluations conducted by employees to assess the performance of retail stores. The evaluations focus on various aspects such as customer service, product availability, store cleanliness, and overall shopping experience. The goal of these visits is to ensure that stores meet company standards and provide a positive experience for customers.
