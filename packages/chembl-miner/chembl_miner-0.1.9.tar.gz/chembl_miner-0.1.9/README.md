# `chembl_miner`: A Python Package for QSAR Analysis

`chembl_miner` is a Python package that streamlines the process of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis using data from the [ChEMBL database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). It provides a complete and automated workflow with a suite of tools for data retrieval, preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning, and model interpretation.

## Motivation ðŸ¤”

This package was developed to organize and automate the QSAR analysis workflow commonly used in pharmaceutical sciences for drug discovery and repurposing. The goal is to provide a clean, reusable, and shareable tool for researchers in the field.

## Target Audience ðŸŽ¯

The primary audience for this package is drug discovery and repurposing researchers, including medicinal chemists, bioinformaticians, and data scientists.

## Key Features ðŸ”¬

  * **Data Retrieval**: Fetch bioactivity data from the ChEMBL database using target ChEMBL IDs and specific activity types.
  * **Data Preprocessing**: A robust and customizable preprocessing pipeline to clean and prepare your data for modeling, which includes handling missing values, converting units, and treating duplicate entries.
  * **Feature Engineering**: Calculate various molecular fingerprints from [PaDEL descriptors](http://yapcwsoft.com/dd/padeldescriptor/) (e.g., PubChem, MACCS, EState).
  * **Machine Learning**: A flexible wrapper for scikit-learn compatible regression models that handles hyperparameter optimization using a genetic algorithm, model evaluation with cross-validation, and fitting of the final model.
  * **Dataset Management**: Convenient wrappers to handle and split datasets for both training and deployment, with support for structural (or scaffold) splitting.
  * **Model Explanation and Analysis**: Tools for both exploratory data analysis and model interpretation.

## Installation ðŸ’»

You can install `chembl_miner` using pip. There are no other dependencies required.

```bash
pip install chembl_miner
```

## Typical Workflow ðŸ§ª

The following is a general workflow for using `chembl_miner`.

### 1\. Data Retrieval and Preprocessing

First, fetch the activity data from ChEMBL for a specific target and preprocess it.

```python
from chembl_miner import *
import pandas as pd

# Set verbosity level (0, 1, or 2)
set_verbosity(1)

# Fetch activity data from ChEMBL
target_chembl_id = "CHEMBL203"  # Example: Cyclooxygenase-1
activity_df = get_activity_data(target_chembl_id, activity_type="IC50")

# Optionally, review and filter assays. For example, to exclude assays with certain keywords:
id_list = review_assays(activity_df, max_entries=5,
                        assay_keywords=['mutant', 'mutated'], exclude_keywords=True)

# Preprocess the data
activity_df = preprocess_data(activity_df, convert_units=True, assay_ids=id_list)

# Calculate molecular fingerprints
descriptors_df = calculate_fingerprint(activity_df, fingerprint="pubchem")

# Create a TrainingData object
# This will split the data into training and testing sets.
# You can use any TrainingData object for the subsequent steps.
dataset = TrainingData.from_dataframe(activity_df, descriptors_df, use_structural_split=True)

# Saving the dataset is optional but recommended for reproducibility
# and to avoid re-running the preprocessing steps.
dataset.to_path("my_qsar_dataset")
```

#### Example Output of `review_assays`

Name: count, dtype: int64
```

### 2\. Hyperparameter Optimization

Next, optimize the hyperparameters of your machine learning model. This example uses XGBoost regression and optimizes for Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

```python
# Load the dataset (if you saved it previously)
# dataset = TrainingData.from_path('my_qsar_dataset')

# Set up the model pipeline
ml = ModelPipeline.setup('xgboost_reg', scoring=['mae'])

# Optimize hyperparameters using a genetic algorithm
param_search = ml.optimize_hyperparameters(dataset=dataset, cv=5, refit='mae', population_size=40)

# Evaluate the model with 10-fold cross-validation
cv_results = ml.evaluate_model(dataset=dataset, cv=10)
print(ml.unpack_cv_results(cv_results))

# The best parameters are stored in ml.params
print('Best parameters found:', ml.params)
```

#### Example Output of `unpack_cv_results`

```
  scorer dataset_type      mean        sd
0    mae         test -0.486349  0.063903
1    mae        train -0.103694  0.003171
```

### 3\. Model Training and Analysis

With the best hyperparameters, train the final model and analyze its performance. For a detailed guide on interpreting the diagnostic plots, please refer to [this resource](https://ema.drwhy.ai/residualDiagnostic.html) by Przemyslaw Biecek and Tomasz Burzykowski (2020).

```python
from chembl_miner import ModelAnalyzer
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_absolute_error, root_mean_squared_error

# If `refit` was used in `optimize_hyperparameters`, the model is already fitted.
# Otherwise, you can fit it with the best parameters:
# ml.fit(dataset, params=ml.params)

# Align test set features with the model's features
dataset.x_test = dataset.x_test[ml.fit_model.feature_names_in_]

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = ml.fit_model.predict(dataset.x_test)

# Calculate performance metrics
r2 = r2_score(y_true=dataset.y_test, y_pred=y_pred)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true=dataset.y_test, y_pred=y_pred)
rmse = root_mean_squared_error(y_true=dataset.y_test, y_pred=y_pred)

print(f"R^2 Score: {r2:.2f}")
print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae:.2f}")
print(f"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse:.2f}")

# Analyze the model's performance on the test set
explainer = ModelAnalyzer(dataset=dataset, fit_model=ml.fit_model, train_subset=False)
explainer.plot_actual_vs_predicted()
explainer.plot_residuals_vs_fitted()
```

## Future Implementations ðŸš€

  - **Expanded Descriptor Support**: Addition of more molecular descriptors (e.g.: RDKit fingerprinters).
  - **Advanced Hyperparameter Search**: Implementation of additional methods like Grid Search and Random Search.
  - **Enhanced CV Visualization**: Improved visualization of cross-validation results.
  - **Classification Models**: Support for classification algorithms.
  - **Model Explainability**: Integration of SHAP for deeper model interpretation.
  - **Similarity Filtering**: Options for similarity-based filtering during data retrieval.
  - **R Implementation**: Potential for an R version of the package.
