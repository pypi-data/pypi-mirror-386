        "\n",
        "This demonstration showcases end-to-end application of `hstrat` to track phylogenetic history of a real-time evolutionary process using the `hstrat` library.\n",
        "This simulation dispatches genomes out over-the-wire on round trips to various web servers via ping requests.\n",
        "This network transport mechanism is intended to demonstrate conditions analogous to distributed (i.e., many-CPU) evolutionary simulations, where trivial centralized ancestry tracking is not possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Digital \"genomes\" in this simulation comprise a four character domain name (e.g., `abcd` for `abcd.com`) that probabilistically mutate from one generation to the next.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each generation, all genomes in the population are serialized and then dispatched as payloads within ping requests to their encoded domain.\n",
        "The first `n` ping responses received back are deserialized and used to create the next generation.\n",
        "In this way, the availaibilty of genomes' encoded domain to expediently return ping responses influences their selection for reproduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The functional content (i.e., domain name) of genomes is supplemented with hstrat instrumentation to allow for phylogenetic reconstruction of simulation history.\n",
        "This instrumentation is also sent over the wire, bundled with the functional genome content.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key features of `hstrat` demonstrated include:\n",
        "- Use of hstrat's stratum retention policies to balance accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction against the constraint of payload size.\n",
        "- Serialization and deserialization of genomes (functional content plus instrumentation) for transmission in ping payloads.\n",
        "- Reconstruction of evolutionary history from the final population's hstrat instrumentation, allowing visualization of phylogenetic history to understand evolutionary dynamics over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simulation proceeds by initializing a population from a common ancestor, subjecting this population to mutations and selections across generations, and finally analyzing the resulting phylogenetic tree to infer the evolutionary history.\n"
