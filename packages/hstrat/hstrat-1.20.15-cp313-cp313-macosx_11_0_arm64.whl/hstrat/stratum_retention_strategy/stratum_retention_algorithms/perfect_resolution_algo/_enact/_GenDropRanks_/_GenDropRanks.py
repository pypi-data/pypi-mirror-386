        Every time a new stratum is deposited, this method is called to

        from this functor are immediately purged from the column, meaning that

        Parameters
        ----------
        policy: Policy
            Policy this functor enacts.
        num_stratum_depositions_completed : int
            The number of strata that have already been deposited, not
            including the latest stratum being deposited which prompted the
            current purge operation.
        retained_ranks : iterator over int
            An iterator over ranks of strata currently retained within the
            hereditary stratigraphic column. Not used in this functor.

        Returns
        -------
        iterator over int
                The ranks of strata that should be purged from the hereditary
            stratigraphic column at this deposition step.
