# Main Governance Document

## The Project

The DeLTA project is an open source scientific software project.
Its aim is to develop and maintain DeLTA, and related tooling, to help lab
scientists process microscopy images of cells through segmentation, tracking
and feature identification.

DeLTA is released under an OSI-approved open source license, developed openly
and hosted on a public git repository [under the delta-microscopy Gitlab
organization](https://gitlab.com/delta-microscopy).

## Contributors

DeLTA is developed by a distributed team of developers and welcomes
contributions from anyone.

Anyone, without discrimination, is welcome to open issues, support requests,
feature requests, or merge requests to DeLTA.

All of these contributions will be considered by members of the board (see the
Governance section).

## Issues

Issues can be answered by anyone, but we recommend that they are closed only by
their authors or board members.

## Merge requests

Merge requests can be merged by any board member after approval of a board member.

For non-trivial merge requests that are opened by a board member, the approval of
another board member is required.

For important changes in DeLTA's code or functionalities, merging a merge request
requires a board vote.

## Governance

DeLTA's governance can currently best be described as a
[self-appointed board](https://communityrule.info/templates/self-appointed-board.html).
It is currently composed of the original DeLTA developers:

- Mary Dunlop
- Jean-Baptiste Lugagne
- Owen O'Connor
- Virgile Andreani

All board members have read and write rights on the repositories.

The board has access to private communication channels (eg. Slack or email) to
coordinate.

The board meets at least twice a year and publish minutes of these meetings in
public.

The board decides of important orientations of the project by majority
voting during board meetings.

Outside board meetings, if a vote is needed, the board is tagged on Gitlab to
give feedback. If no majority against a proposal emerges within a few weeks,
the proposal is considered to have been adopted.

Anyone is welcome to provide feedback on DeLTA's governance as issues on the
repository.
