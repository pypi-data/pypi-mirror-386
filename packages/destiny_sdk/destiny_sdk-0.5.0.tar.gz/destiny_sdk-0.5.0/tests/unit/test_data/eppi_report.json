      "Abstract": "Background\nWhile human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been available since 2006, the coverage has varied among countries. Our aim is to analyse the equity impact of HPV vaccination on the lifetime projections of cervical cancer burden among vaccinated cohorts of 2010–22 in 84 countries.\n\nMethods\nWe used WHO and UNICEF estimates of national immunisation coverage for HPV vaccination in 84 countries during 2010–22. We used PRIME (Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics) to estimate the lifetime health impact of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer burden in terms of deaths, cases, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by vaccination in their respective countries. We generated concentration indices and curves to assess the equity impact of HPV vaccination across 84 countries.\n\nFindings\nThe health impact of HPV vaccination varied across the 84 countries and ranged from Switzerland to Tanzania at 2 to 34 deaths, 4 to 47 cases, and 40 to 735 DALYs averted per 1000 vaccinated adolescent girls over the lifetime of the vaccinated cohorts of 2010–22. The concentration index for the distribution of average coverage during 2010–22 among the 84 countries ranked by vaccine impact was 0.33 (95% CI: 0.27–0.40) and highlights the wide inequities in HPV vaccination coverage.\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings suggested that countries with a relatively higher cervical cancer burden and thereby a relatively higher need for HPV vaccination had relatively lower coverage during 2010–22. Further, there were significant inequities in HPV vaccination coverage within the Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific regions, and in high- and low-income countries with a pro-advantaged and regressive distribution favouring countries with lower vaccine impact."

      "Abstract": "The World Health Organization has recommended the inclusion of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in national immunization programs to address the global problem of cervical cancer. In the Philippines, HPV vaccination was introduced in a phased approach in 2015. This study seeks to estimate the cost of delivery of the HPV vaccination program and its operational context in the Philippines.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective, cross-sectional micro-costing study focused on ongoing HPV vaccination delivery and its operational context across all levels of the health system. Using structured questionnaires and data collection from secondary sources, the weighted mean financial and economic costs and costs per dose at the national, subnational, and health facility levels were estimated.\nResults\nThe weighted mean financial and economic costs per dose of the HPV vaccination program aggregated across all levels of the health system were $US3.72and $29.74, respectively. Activities contributing most significantly to costs were service delivery and vaccine collection or distribution and storage at the health facility and administrative levels, respectively. The opportunity costs for health worker and non-health worker time accounted for 77% of the economic cost per dose.\nConclusion\nThe total weighted mean financial and economic costs of HPV delivery are within range of those reported in other countries. Costing studies can help identify cost drivers with local operational context to help inform policymakers and program managers in budgeting and planning interventions to improve program implementation."

      "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has not been introduced in many countries in South-Central Asia, including Afghanistan, despite the sub-region having the highest incidence rate of cervical cancer in Asia. This study estimates the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in Afghanistan to inform national decision-making. An Excel-based static cohort model was used to estimate the lifetime costs and health outcomes of vaccinating a single cohort of 9-year-old girls in the year 2018 with the bivalent HPV vaccine, compared to no vaccination. We also explored a scenario with a catch-up campaign for girls aged 10–14 years. Input parameters were based on local sources, published literature, or assumptions when no data was available. The primary outcome measure was the discounted cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, evaluated from both government and societal perspectives. Vaccinating a single cohort of 9-year-old girls against HPV in Afghanistan could avert 1718 cervical cancer cases, 125 hospitalizations, and 1612 deaths over the lifetime of the cohort. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$426 per DALY averted from the government perspective and US$400 per DALY averted from the societal perspective. The estimated annual cost of the HPV vaccination program (US$3,343,311) represents approximately 3.53% of the country′s total immunization budget for 2018 or 0.13% of total health expenditures. In Afghanistan, HPV vaccine introduction targeting a single cohort is potentially cost-effective (0.7 times the GDP per capita of $586) from both the government and societal perspective with additional health benefits generated by a catch-up campaign, depending on the government′s willingness to pay for the projected health outcomes."

      "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary cause of cervical cancer. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director General announced his commitment to eliminate cervical cancer, with HPV vaccination as a priority. However, the costs of setting up a multi-dose HPV vaccination programme remain a barrier to its introduction. We are conducting a randomised-controlled trial of reduced dose schedules of HPV vaccine in Tanzania to establish whether a single dose produces immune responses that will be effective in preventing cervical cancer. 930 girls aged 9–14 years in Mwanza, Tanzania, were randomised to one of 6 arms, comprising 3 different dose schedules of the 2-valent (Cervarix) and 9-valent (Gardasil-9) HPV vaccines: 3 doses; 2 doses given 6 months apart; or a single dose. All participants will be followed for 36 months; those in the 1 and 2 dose arms will be followed for 60 months. Trial outcomes focus on vaccine immune responses including HPV 16/18-specific antibody levels, antibody avidity, and memory B cell responses. Results will be immunobridged to historical cohorts of girls and young women in whom efficacy has been demonstrated. This is the first randomised trial of the single dose HPV vaccine schedule in the target age group. The trial will allow us to examine the quality and durability of immune responses of reduced dose schedules in a population with high burden of malaria and other infections that may affect vaccine immune responses. Initial results (24 months) are expected to be published in early 2021."
