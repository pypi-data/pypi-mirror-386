Destructive form actions
========================

Destructive form actions are potentially dangerous. They can be used to
mark actions like deleting important objects. Their representation includes a UI mode that avoids users to accidentally click them.

In our implementation, we provide some javascript that initially
disables the actual action button and provides a checkbox near it that
has to enable it first:

>>> from gocept.form.action import DestructiveAction, render_destructive_action
>>> action = DestructiveAction("Delete")
>>> print(render_destructive_action(action)())
<input type="submit" id="actions.delete" name="actions.delete" value="Delete" class="button" />
         <script type="text/javascript">
         document.getElementById('actions.delete').disabled = true;
         </script>
         <label>
             <input
             type="checkbox"
             id="actions.delete.unlock"
             onChange="document.getElementById('actions.delete').disabled = !this.checked"/> Unlock &quot;Delete&quot; button</label>


Notice: We only enhance the UI when javascript is enabled. We try to not
get in the way of existing patterns to avoid usability on unpredicted
platforms.
