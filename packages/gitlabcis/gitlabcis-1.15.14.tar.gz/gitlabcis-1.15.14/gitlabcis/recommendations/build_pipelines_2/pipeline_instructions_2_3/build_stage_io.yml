title: Ensure steps have clearly defined build stage input and output
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: pipeline_instructions
description: >-
  Define clear expected input and output for each build stage.
rationale: >-
  In order to have more control over data flow in the build pipeline, clearly define the input 
  and output of the pipeline steps. If anything malicious happens during the build stage, it 
  will be recognized more easily and stand out as an anomaly.
impact: >-
audit: |
  For each build stage, verify that the expected input and output are clearly defined.
    • On the left sidebar, select Code > Repository.
    • Review the .gitlab-ci.yml file to check if the build stage job input and output are clearly defined.
remediation: |
  For each build stage, clearly define what is expected for input and output.
    • On the left sidebar, select Code > Repository.
    • Ensure the .gitlab-ci.yml file has build stage job input and output clearly defined.
