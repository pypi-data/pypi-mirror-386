title: Ensure pipelines are automatically scanned for misconfigurations
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: pipeline_instructions
description: >-
  Scan the pipeline for misconfigurations. It is recommended that this be performed 
  automatically.
rationale: >-
  Automatic scans for misconfigurations detect human mistakes and misconfigured tasks. 
  This protects the environment from backdoors caused by such mistakes, which create 
  easier access for attackers. For example, a task that mistakenly configures credentials 
  to persist on the disk makes it easier for an attacker to steal them. This type of incident 
  can be prevented by auto-scanning.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each pipeline, verify that it is automatically scanned for misconfigurations.
remediation: >-
  For each pipeline, set automated misconfiguration scanning.

      Establish and maintain a secure configuration process for enterprise assets 
      (end-user devices, including portable and mobile, non-computing/IoT devices, and 
      servers) and software (operating systems and applications). Review and update 
      documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could 
      impact this Safeguard.
