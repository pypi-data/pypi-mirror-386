title: Ensure the creation of the build environment is automated
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: build_environment
description: >-
  Automate the creation of the build environment.
rationale: >-
  Automating the deployment of the build environment reduces the risk for human 
  mistakes — such as a wrong configuration or exposure of sensitive data — because it 
  requires less human interaction and intervention. It also eases re-deployment of the 
  environment. It is best to automate with Infrastructure as Code because it offers more 
  control over changes made to the environment creation configuration and stores to a 
  version control platform.
impact: >-
audit: |
  Verify that the deployment of the build environment is automated and can be easily redeployed.
  In GitLab, build environments are automatically created for each CI/CD pipeline. To verify that a build environment has been automatically created, do the following:
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • Select Operate > Environments.
    • Review the environments.

  Automate the deployment of the build environment. 
  In GitLab, build environments are automatically created for each CI/CD pipeline. 
  To automate a deployment of the build environment, you need to create a CI/CD pipeline using the gitlab-ci.yml file.
