description: >-
  Use secured webhooks of the build environment.
rationale: >-
  Webhooks are used for triggering an HTTP request based on an action made in the 
  platform. Typically, build environment feature webhooks for a pipeline trigger based on 
  source code event. Since webhooks are an HTTP POST request, they can be 
  malformed if not secured over SSL. To prevent a potential hack and compromise of the 
  webhook or to the environment or web server excepting the request, use only secured 
  webhooks.
