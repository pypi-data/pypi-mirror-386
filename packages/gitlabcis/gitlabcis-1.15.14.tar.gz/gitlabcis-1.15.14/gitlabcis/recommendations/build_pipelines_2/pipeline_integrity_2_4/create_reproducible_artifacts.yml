title: Ensure the build pipeline creates reproducible artifacts
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: pipeline_integrity
description: >-
  Verify that the build pipeline creates reproducible artifacts, meaning that an artifact of 
  the build pipeline is the same in every run when given the same input.
rationale: >-
  A reproducible build is a build that produces the same artifact when given the same 
  input data. Ensuring that the build pipeline produces the same artifact when given the 
  same input helps verify that no change has been made to the artifact. This action allows 
  an organization to trust that its artifacts are built only from safe code that has been 
  reviewed and tested and has not been tainted or changed abruptly.

audit: |
  Ensure that build pipelines create reproducible artifacts.
    • On the left sidebar, select Build > Artifacts.
    • Review the artifacts associated to your build pipelines
remediation: |
  Create build pipelines that produce the same artifact given the same input (for example, artifacts that do not rely on timestamps).
    • On the left sidebar, select Code > Repository.
    • Check if a .gitlab-ci.yml file is at the root of your repository
    • To create job artifacts, use the artifacts keyword in your .gitlab-ci.yml file, as in this example:

      pdf:
      script: xelatex mycv.tex
      artifacts:
      paths:
      - mycv.pdf

  In this example, a job named pdf calls the xelatex command to build a PDF file from the LaTeX source file, mycv.tex.
  The paths keyword determines which files to add to the job artifacts. All paths to files and directories are relative to the repository where the job was created.
