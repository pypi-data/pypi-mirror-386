title: Ensure run-time security is enforced for build workers
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: build_worker
description: >-
  Add traces to build workers' operating systems and installed applications so that in run 
  time, collected events can be analyzed to detect suspicious behavior patterns and 
  malware.
rationale: >-
  Build workers are exposed to data exfiltration attacks, code injection attacks, and more 
  while running. It is important to secure them from such attacks by enforcing run-time 
  security on the build worker itself. This will identify attempted attacks in real time and 
  prevent them.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Verify that a run-time security solution is enforced on every active build worker.
remediation: >-
  Deploy and enforce a run-time security solution on build workers.
