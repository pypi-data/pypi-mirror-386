title: Ensure build workers are single-used

category: build_pipelines
sub_category: build_worker
description: >-
  Use a clean instance of build worker for every pipeline run.
rationale: >-
  Using a clean instance of build worker for every pipeline run eliminates the risks of data 
  theft, data integrity breaches, and unavailability. It limits the pipeline's access to data 
  stored on the file system from previous runs, and the cache is volatile. This prevents 
  malicious changes from affecting other pipelines or the Continuous 
  Integration/Continuous Delivery system itself.
impact: >-
  Data and cache will not be saved in different pipeline runs.
audit: >-
  Ensure that every pipeline that is being run has its own clean, new runner. 
  In GitLab, each of your jobs runs in a newly provisioned VM, which is dedicated to the 
  specific job. 
  The VM is active only for the duration of the job and immediately deleted. 
  This means that any changes that your job makes to the virtual machine will not be 
  available to a subsequent job. 
  The virtual machine where your job runs has sudo access with no password.
remediation: >-
  Create a clean build worker for every pipeline that is being run, or use build platform-
  hosted runners, as they typically offer a clean instance for every run. 
  In GitLab, use Runner SaaS to ensure all of these settings are available by default and 
  that each job runs in a dedicated VM.
