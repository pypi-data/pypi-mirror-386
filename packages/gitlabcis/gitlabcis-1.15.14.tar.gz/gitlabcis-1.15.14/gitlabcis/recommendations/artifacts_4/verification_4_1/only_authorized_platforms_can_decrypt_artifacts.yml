title: Ensure only authorized platforms have decryption capabilities of artifacts
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: verification
description: >-
  Grant decryption capabilities of artifacts only to trusted and authorized platforms.
rationale: >-
  Build artifacts might contain sensitive data such as production configuration. To protect 
  them and decrease the risk of a breach, it is recommended to encrypt them before 
  delivery. This will make them unreadable for every unauthorized user who doesn't have 
  the decryption key. By implementing this, the decryption capabilities become overly 
  sensitive in order to prevent a data leak or theft. Ensuring that only trusted and 
  authorized platforms can decrypt the organization's packages decreases the possibility 
  for an attacker to gain access to the critical data in artifacts.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Ensure only trusted and authorized platforms have decryption capabilities of the 
  organization's artifacts.
remediation: >-
  Grant decryption capabilities of the organization's artifacts only for trusted and 
  authorized platforms.
