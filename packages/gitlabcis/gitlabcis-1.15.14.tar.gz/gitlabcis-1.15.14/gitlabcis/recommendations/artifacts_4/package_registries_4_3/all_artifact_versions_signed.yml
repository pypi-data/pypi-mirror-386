title: Ensure all versions of an existing artifact have their signatures validated
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: package_registries
description: >-
  Validate the signature of all versions of an existing artifact.
rationale: >-
  In order to be certain a version of an existing and trusted artifact is not malicious or 
  delivered by someone looking to interfere with the supply chain, it is a good practice to 
  validate the signatures of each version. Doing so decreases the risk of using a 
  compromised artifact, which might lead to a breach.
impact: >-
audit: |
  For each artifact, ensure that all of its versions are signed and validated before it is uploaded or used.
  Ensure every artifact in the package registry has been validated with its signature.
  1. On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • To review commits for a project, select Code > Commits.
    • To review commits for a merge request, select Code > Merge requests, then select your merge request.
  2. Select Commits.
  3. Identify the commit you want to review. Signed commits show either a Verified or Unverified badge, depending on the verification status of the signature. Unsigned commits do not display a badge.
remediation: >-
  For each artifact, sign and validate each version before uploading or using the artifact.
