title: Ensure all signed artifacts are validated upon uploading the package registry
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: package_registries
description: >-
  Validate artifact signatures before uploading to the package registry.
rationale: >-
  Cryptographic signature is a tool to verify artifact authenticity. Every artifact is supposed 
  to be signed by its creator in order to confirm that it was not compromised before 
  reaching the client. Validating an artifact signature before delivering it is another level of 
  protection which ensures the signature has not been changed, meaning no one tried or 
  succeeded in tampering with the artifact. This creates trust between the supplier and the 
  client.
impact: >-
audit: |
  Ensure every artifact in the package registry has been validated with its signature.
  1. On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • To review commits for a project, select Code > Commits.
    • To review commits for a merge request, select Code > Merge requests, then select your merge request.
  2. Select Commits.
  3. Identify the commit you want to review. Signed commits show either a Verified or Unverified badge, depending on the verification status of the signature. Unsigned commits do not display a badge.
remediation: >-
  Validate every artifact with its signature before uploading it to the package registry. It is 
  recommended to do so automatically.
default_value: Artifacts are not scanned by default.
