title: Ensure changes in package registry configuration are audited
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: package_registries
description: >-
  Audit changes of the package registry configuration.
rationale: >-
  The package registry is a crucial component in the software supply chain. It stores 
  artifacts with potentially sensitive data that will eventually be deployed and used in 
  production. Every change made to the package registry configuration must be examined 
  carefully to ensure no exposure of the registry's sensitive data. This examination also 
  ensures no malicious actors have performed modifications to a stored artifact. Auditing 
  the configuration and its changes helps in decreasing such risks.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Verify that all changes to the packages registry configuration are audited.
remediation: >-
  Audit the changes to the package registry configuration.
default_value: GitHub audits this by default.
