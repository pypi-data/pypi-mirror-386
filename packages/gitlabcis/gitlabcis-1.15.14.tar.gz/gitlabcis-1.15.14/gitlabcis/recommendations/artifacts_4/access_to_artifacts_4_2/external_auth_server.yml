title: Ensure user management of the package registry is not local
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: access_to_artifacts
description: >-
  Manage users and their access to the package registry with an external authentication 
  server and not with the package registry itself.
rationale: >-
  Some package registries offer a tool for user management, aside from the main 
  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Active Directory (AD) server of the 
  organization. That tool usually offers simple authentication and role-based permissions, 
  which might not be granular enough. Having multiple user management tools in the 
  organization could result in confusion and privilege escalation, as there will be more to 
  manage. To avoid a situation where users escalate their privileges because someone 
  missed them, manage user access to the package registry via the main authentication 
  server and not locally on the package registry.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each package registry, verify that its user access is not managed locally, but instead 
  with the main authentication server of the organization.
remediation: >-
  For each package registry, use the main authentication server of the organization for 
  user management and do not manage locally.

    name: Protect Information through Access Control Lists
    description: >-
      Protect all information stored on systems with file system, network share, 
      claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will 
      enforce the principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the 
      information based on their need to access the information as a part of their 
      responsibilities.
