title: Ensure user access to the package registry utilizes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
profile: 2
category: artifacts
sub_category: access_to_artifacts
description: >-
  Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for user access to the package registry.
rationale: >-
  By default, every user authenticates to the system by password only. If a user's 
  password is compromised, the user account and all its related packages are in danger 
  of data theft and malicious builds. It is therefore recommended that each user enables 
  Multi-Factor Authentication. This additional step guarantees that the account stays 
  secure even if the user's password is compromised, as it adds another layer of 
  authentication.
impact: >-

    name: Require MFA for Externally-Exposed Applications
    description: >-
      Require all externally-exposed enterprise or third-party applications to enforce 
      MFA, where supported. Enforcing MFA through a directory service or SSO 
      provider is a satisfactory implementation of this Safeguard.
