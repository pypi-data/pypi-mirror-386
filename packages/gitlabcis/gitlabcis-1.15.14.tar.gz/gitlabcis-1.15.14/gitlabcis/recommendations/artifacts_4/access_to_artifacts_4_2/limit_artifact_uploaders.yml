title: Ensure number of permitted users who may upload new artifacts is minimized
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: access_to_artifacts
description: >-
  Minimize ability to upload artifacts to the lowest number of trusted users possible.
rationale: >-
  Artifacts might contain sensitive data. Even the simplest mistake can also lead to trust 
  issues with customers and harm the integrity of the product. To decrease these risks, 
  allow only trusted and qualified users to upload new artifacts. Those users are less 
  likely to make mistakes. Having the lowest number of such users possible will also 
  decrease the risk of hacked user accounts, which could lead to a massive breach or 
  artifact compromising.
impact: >-
audit: |
  Ensure only trusted and qualified users can upload new artifacts, and that their number is the lowest possible.
