title: Ensure deployment configuration manifests are pinned to a specific, verified version
profile: 1
category: deployment
sub_category: deployment_configuration
description: >-
  Deployment configuration is often stored in a version control system and is pulled from 
  there. Pin the configuration used to a specific, verified version or commit Secure Hash 
  Algorithm (SHA). Avoid referring configuration without its version tag specified.
rationale: >-
  Deployment configuration manifests are often stored in version control systems and 
  pulled from there either by automation platforms, for example Ansible, or GitOps 
  platforms, such as ArgoCD. When a manifest is pulled from a version control system 
  without tag or commit Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) specified, it is pulled from the 
  HEAD revision, which is equal to the 'latest' tag, and pulls the last change made. This 
  increases the risk of encountering a new, potentially malicious configuration. If an 
  attacker pushes malicious configuration to the version control system, the next user who 
  pulls the HEAD revision will pull it and risk attack. To avoid that risk, use a version tag of 
  verified version or a commit SHA of a trusted commit, which will ensure this is the only 
  version pulled.
impact: >-
  Changes in deployment configuration will not be pulled unless their version tag or 
  commit Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is specified. This might slow down the 
  deployment process.
audit: >-
  For every deployment configuration manifest in use, ensure it is pinned to a specific 
  version or commit Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).
remediation: >-
  For every deployment configuration manifest in use, pin to a specific version or commit 
  Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).

    description: >-
      Establish and maintain a secure configuration process for enterprise assets 
      (end-user devices, including portable and mobile, non-computing/IoT devices, and 
      servers) and software (operating systems and applications). Review and update 
      documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could 
      impact this Safeguard.
