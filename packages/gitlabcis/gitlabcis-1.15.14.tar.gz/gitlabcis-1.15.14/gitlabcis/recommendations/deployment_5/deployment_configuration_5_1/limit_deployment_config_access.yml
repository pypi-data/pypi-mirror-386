sub_category: deployment_configuration
description: >-
  Restrict access to the deployment configuration to trusted and qualified users only.
rationale: >-
  Deployment configurations are sensitive in nature. The tiniest mistake can lead to 
  downtime or bugs in production, which can have a direct effect on the product's integrity 
  and customer trust. Misconfigurations might also be used by malicious actors to attack 
  the production platform. To avoid such harm as much as possible, ensure only trusted 
  and qualified users have access to such configurations. This will also reduce the 
  number of accounts that might affect the environment in case of an attack.
impact: >-
  Reducing the number of users who have access to the deployment configuration means 
  those users would lose their ability to make direct changes to that configuration.
audit: >-
  Verify each deployment configuration is accessible only to known and authorized users.
remediation: >-
  Restrict access to the deployment configuration to trusted and qualified users.

    name: Protect Information through Access Control Lists
    description: >-
      Protect all information stored on systems with file system, network share, 
      claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will 
      enforce the principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the 
      information based on their need to access the information as a part of their 
      responsibilities.
