description: >-
  Detect and prevent misconfigurations or insecure instructions in Infrastructure as Code 
  (IaC) files, such as Terraform files.
rationale: >-
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files are used for production environment and application 
  deployment. These are sensitive parts of the software supply chain because they are 
  always in touch with customers, and thus might affect their opinion of or trust in the 
  product. Attackers often target these environments. Detecting and fixing 
  misconfigurations and/or insecure instructions in IaC files decreases the risk for data 
  leak or data theft. It is important to secure IaC instructions in order to prevent further 
  problems of deployment, exposed assets, or improper configurations, which might 
  ultimately lead to easier ways to attack and steal organization data.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For every Infrastructure as Code (IaC) instructions file, verify that scanners are set to 
  identify and prevent misconfigurations and insecure instructions.
remediation: >-
  For every Infrastructure as Code (IaC) instructions file, set scanners to identify and 
  prevent misconfigurations and insecure instructions.

    name: Use Standard Hardening Configuration Templates for Application Infrastructure
    description: >-
      Use standard, industry-recommended hardening configuration templates for 
      application infrastructure components. This includes underlying servers, databases, 
      and web servers, and applies to cloud containers, Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
      components, and SaaS components. Do not allow in-house developed software to 
      weaken configuration hardening.

    description: >-
      For applications that rely on a database, use standard hardening configuration 
      templates. All systems that are part of critical business processes should also be 
      tested.
