title: Ensure access to production environment is limited
profile: 1
category: deployment
sub_category: deployment_environment
description: >-
  Restrict access to the production environment to a few trusted and qualified users only.
rationale: >-
  The production environment is an extremely sensitive one. It directly affects the 
  customer experience and trust in a product, which has serious effects on the 
  organization itself. Because of this sensitive nature, it is important to restrict access to 
  the production environment to only a few trusted and qualified users. This will reduce 
  the risk of mistakes such as exposure of secrets or misconfiguration. This restriction 
  also reduces the number of accounts that are vulnerable to hijacking in order to 
  potentially harm the production environment.
impact: >-
  Reducing the number of users who have access to the production environment means 
  those users would lose their ability to make direct changes to that environment.
audit: >-
  Verify that the production environment is accessible only to trusted and qualified users.
remediation: >-
  Restrict access to the production environment to trusted and qualified users.
