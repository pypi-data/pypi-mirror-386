# 5.2 Deployment Environment

This section consists of security recommendations for the management of the deployment environment.

The deployment environment is the orchestrator and the production environment where the application is deployed. It directly affects the customer experience and trust in a product, which has serious effects on the organization itself. Securing it varies from access management to automation.

## Recommendations

* [5.2.1 - automate_deployment.yml](./automate_deployment.yml)
* [5.2.2 - reproducible_deployment.yml](./reproducible_deployment.yml)
* [5.2.3 - limit_prod_access.yml](./limit_prod_access.yml)
* [5.2.4 - disable_default_passwords.yml](./disable_default_passwords.yml)
