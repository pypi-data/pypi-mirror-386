# 5 Deployment

This section consists of security recommendations for management of the release process, the application deployment, and the configuration files that comes with it.

This is the final phase of the software supply chain. After that, the client already uses the application, and it is running in production. This phase contains the deployment orchestrator, the deployment configuration, the manifest files, and the deployment environment. It is important to secure all of these to deliver the software to the client safely.
