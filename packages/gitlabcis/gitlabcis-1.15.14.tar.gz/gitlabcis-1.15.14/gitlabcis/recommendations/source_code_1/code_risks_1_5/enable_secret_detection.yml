title: Ensure scanners are in place to identify and prevent sensitive data in code
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: code_risks
description: >-
  Detect and prevent sensitive data in code, such as confidential ID numbers, passwords, etc.
rationale: >-
  Having sensitive data in the source code makes it easier for attackers to maliciously use 
  such information. In order to avoid this, designate scanners to identify and prevent the 
  existence of sensitive data in the code.
impact: >-
audit: |
  For every repository in use, verify that scanners are set to identify and prevent the existence of sensitive data in code by performing the following:
    1. On GitLab, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    2. Review the CI pipeline configuration to verify that Secret Detection has been enabled on this project.
