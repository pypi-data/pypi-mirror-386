title: Ensure scanners are in place for code vulnerabilities
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: code_risks
description: >-
  Detect and prevent known open source vulnerabilities in the code.
rationale: >-
  Open source code blocks are used a lot in developed software. This has its own 
  advantages, but it also has risks. Because the code is open for everyone, it means that 
  attackers can publish or add malicious code to these open-source code blocks, or use 
  their knowledge to find vulnerabilities in an existing code. Detecting and fixing such 
  code vulnerabilities, by SCA (Software Composition Analysis) prevents insecure flaws 
  from reaching production. It gives another opportunity for developers to secure the 
  source code before it is deployed in production, where it is far more exposed and 
  vulnerable to attacks.

audit: |
  For every repository that is in use, verify that a scanning tool is set to identify and prevent code vulnerabilities by performing the following:
    1. On GitLab, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    2. Review the CI pipeline configuration to verify that SAST has been configured to run on this project.
