title: Ensure scanners are in place to secure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) instructions
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: code_risks
description: >-
  Detect and prevent misconfigurations or insecure instructions in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files, such as Terraform files.
rationale: >-
  Detecting and fixing misconfigurations and/or insecure instructions in IaC (Infrastructure 
  as Code) files decreases the risk for data leak or data theft. It is important to secure IaC 
  instructions in order to prevent further problems of deployment, exposed assets, or 
  improper configurations, which can ultimately lead to easier ways to attack and steal 
  organization data.
impact: >-
audit: |
  For every repository that holds IaC instructions files, verify that a scanning tool such as GitLab's Infrastructure as Code scanning is configured to identify and prevent misconfigurations and insecure instructions.
    1. On GitLab, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    2. Review the CI pipeline configuration to verify that IaC scanning has been enabled on this project.
remediation: |
  For every repository that holds IaC instructions files, configure GitLab's Infrastructure as Code scanning (or another IaC scanning tool) to identify and prevent misconfigurations and insecure instructions.
    1. On GitLab, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    2. Enable IaC scanning for this project.

    name: Use Standard Hardening Configuration Templates for Application Infrastructure
    description: >-
      Use standard, industry-recommended hardening configuration templates for 
      application infrastructure components. This includes underlying servers, databases, 
      and web servers, and applies to cloud containers, Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
      components, and SaaS components. Do not allow in-house developed software to 
      weaken configuration hardening.

    description: >-
      Utilize an up-to-date SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool to 
      automatically scan all systems on the network on a weekly or more frequent basis 
      to identify all potential vulnerabilities on the organization's systems.

    description: >-
      For applications that rely on a database, use standard hardening configuration 
      templates. All systems that are part of critical business processes should also be 
      tested.
