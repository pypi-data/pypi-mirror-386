title: Ensure scanners are in place for open-source license issues in used packages
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: code_risks
description: >-
  Detect open-source license problems in used dependencies and fix them.
rationale: >-
  A software license is a legal document that establishes several key conditions between 
  a software company or developer and a user in order to allow the use of software. 
  Software licenses have the potential to create code dependencies. Not following the 
  conditions in the software license can also lead to lawsuits. When using packages with 
  a software license, especially commercial ones (which are the most permissive), it is 
  important to verify what is allowed by that license in order to be protected against 
  lawsuits.

  Ensure a license scanning tool is set up to identify open-source license problems and that every package you use is scanned by it.
    • The Dependency Scanning or Container Scanning CI job must be configured for your project.
    • Your project uses at least one of the languages and package managers supported by Gemnasium.
    • A successful pipeline was run on the default branch. You should not change the default behavior of allowing the application security jobs to fail.
    • Review the output from the scan in Secure > Dependency list.
