description: >-
  Ensure an administrator approval is required when installing applications.
rationale: >-
  Applications are typically automated integrations that improve the workflow of an 
  organization. They are written by third-party developers, and therefore should be 
  validated before using in case they're malicious or not trustable. Because administrators 
  are expected to be the most qualified and trusted members of the organization, they 
  should review the applications being installed and decide whether they are both trusted 
  and necessary.
impact: >-
  Applications will not be installed without administrator approval.
audit: |
  Verify that applications are installed only after receiving administrator approval:
  You are compliant by default. That is because by default only maintainers and owners
  can integrate with external applications.

  For OAuth Apps, perform the following:
    • On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
    • Select Edit profile and then select Applications.
    • See the Authorized applications section.
    • Review the scope level for the authorised applications with your credentials
