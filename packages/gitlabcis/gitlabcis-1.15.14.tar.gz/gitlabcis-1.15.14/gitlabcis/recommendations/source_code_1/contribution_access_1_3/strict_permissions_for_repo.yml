title: Ensure strict base permissions are set for repositories
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: contribution_access
description: >-
  Base permissions define the permission level automatically granted to all organization 
  members. Define strict base access permissions for all of the repositories in the 
  organization, including new ones.
rationale: >-
  Defining strict base permissions is the best practice in every role-based access control 
  (RBAC) system. If the base permission is high — for example, "write" permission — 
  every member of the organization will have "write" permission to every repository in the 
  organization. This will apply regardless of the specific permissions a user might need, 
  which generally differ between organization repositories. The higher the permission, the 
  higher the risk for incidents such as bad code commit or data breach. It is therefore 
  recommended to set the base permissions to the strictest level possible.
impact: >-
  Users might not be able to access organization repositories or perform some acts as 
  commits. These specific permissions should be granted individually for each user or 
  team, as needed.
audit: |
  Verify that strict base permissions are set for the organization groups by doing the following:
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • Select Manage > Members.
    • At the top of the member list, from the dropdown list, select Max role the members have in the group and descending order.

    In GitLab, you set the specific role for each new user in your group. Check the roles of your users to determine if it matches the least-privilege principle.

  Set strict base permissions for the organization groups with the next steps:
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • Select Manage > Members.
    • At the top of the member list, from the dropdown list, select Max role the members have in the group and descending order.
    In GitLab, you set the specific role for each new user in your group. Ensure the roles for your users match the least-privilege principle.

    name: Use Standard Hardening Configuration Templates for Application Infrastructure
    description: >-
      Use standard, industry-recommended hardening configuration templates for 
      application infrastructure components. This includes underlying servers, databases, 
      and web servers, and applies to cloud containers, Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
      components, and SaaS components. Do not allow in-house developed software to 
      weaken configuration hardening.

    name: Use Standard Hardening Configuration Templates for Databases
    description: >-
      For applications that rely on a database, use standard hardening configuration
      templates. All systems that are part of critical business processes should also be
      tested.
