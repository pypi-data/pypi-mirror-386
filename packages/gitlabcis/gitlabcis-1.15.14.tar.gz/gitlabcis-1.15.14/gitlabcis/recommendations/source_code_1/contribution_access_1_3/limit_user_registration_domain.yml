title: Ensure new members are required to be invited using company-approved email
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: contribution_access
description: >-
  Existing members of an organization can invite new members to join, however new 
  members must only be invited with their company-approved email.
rationale: >-
  Ensuring new members of an organization have company-approved email prevents 
  existing members of the organization from inviting arbitrary new users to join. Without 
  this verification, they can invite anyone who is using the organization's version control 
  system or has an active email account, thus allowing outside users (and potential threat 
  actors) to easily gain access to company private code and resources. This practice will 
  subsequently reduce the chance of human error or typos when inviting a new member.
impact: >-
  Existing members would not be able to invite new users who do not have a company-
  approved email address.
audit: >-
  For each group in use, verify for every invitation that the invited email address is 
  company-approved by performing the following: 
  On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group. 
  Select Manage > Members. 
  Members that are not automatically added are displayed on the Invited tab. 
  Verify that each invitation email is company approved by your company. 
remediation: >-
  For each group, allow only users with company-approved email to be invited. If a user 
  was invited without company-approved email, perform the following: 
  On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group. 
  Select Manage > Members. 
  Members that are not automatically added are displayed on the Invited tab. 
  Verify that each invitation email is company approved by your company. 
  To cancel the user's invitation to join your organization, click Cancel invitation.
