title: Ensure Git access is limited based on IP addresses
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: contribution_access
description: >-
  Limit Git access based on IP addresses by having a allowlist of IP addresses from which connection is possible.
rationale: >-
  Allowing access to Git repositories (source code) only from specific IP addresses adds 
  yet another layer of restriction and reduces the risk of unauthorized connection to the 
  organization's assets. This will prevent attackers from accessing Source Code 
  Management (SCM), as they would first need to know the allowed IP addresses to gain 
  access to them.
impact: >-
  Only members with allowlisted IP addresses will be able to access the organization's Git 
  repositories.

  To ensure only people from your organization can access particular resources, you can restrict access to groups by IP address. This top-level group setting applies to:
  The GitLab UI, including subgroups, projects, and issues. It does not apply to GitLab Pages.

  In GitLab 12.3 and later, the API.
  
  In self-managed installations of GitLab 15.1 and later, you can also configure globally-allowed IP address ranges at the group level.
  To determine whether IP restrictions are in place:
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group.
    • Select Settings > General.
    • Expand the Permissions and group features section.
    • In the Restrict access by IP address text box, view the list of IP addresses.

  To restrict group access by IP address:
    1. On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group.
    2. Select Settings > General.
    3. Expand the Permissions and group features section.
    4. In the Restrict access by IP address text box, enter a list of IPv4 or IPv6 address ranges in CIDR notation. This list:
      • Has no limit on the number of IP address ranges.
      • Has a size limit of 1 GB.
      • Applies to both SSH or HTTP authorized IP address ranges. You cannot split this list by type of authorization.
    5. Select Save changes.
