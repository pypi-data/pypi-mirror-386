title: Ensure Source Code Management (SCM) email notifications are restricted to verified domains
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: contribution_access
description: >-
  Restrict the Source Code Management (SCM) organization's email notifications to approved domains only.
rationale: >-
  Restricting Source Code Management email notifications to verified domains only 
  prevents data leaks, as personal emails and custom domains are more prone to 
  account takeover via DNS hijacking or password breach.
impact: >-
  Only members with approved email would be able to receive Source Code Management 
  notifications.
