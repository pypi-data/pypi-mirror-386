description: >-
  Ensure the organization has a minimum number of administrators.
rationale: >-
  Organization administrators have the highest level of permissions, including the ability 
  to add/remove collaborators, create or delete repositories, change branch protection 
  policy, and convert to a publicly-accessible repository. Due to the permissive access 
  granted to an organization administrator, it is highly recommended to keep the number 
  of administrator accounts as minimal as possible.
