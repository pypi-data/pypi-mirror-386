title: Ensure code owners are set for extra sensitive code or configuration
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: code_changes
description: >-
  Code owners are trusted users that are responsible for reviewing and managing an 
  important piece of code or configuration. An organization is advised to set code owners 
  for every extremely sensitive code or configuration.
rationale: >-
  Configuring code owners protects data by verifying that trusted users will notice and 
  review every edit, thus preventing unwanted or malicious changes from potentially 
  compromising sensitive code or configurations.
impact: >-
  Code owner users will receive notifications for every change that occurs to the code and
  subsequently added as reviewers of merge requests automatically.
audit: |
  In every project, view the Code Owners of a file or directory:
    1. On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    2. Select Code > Repository.
    3. Go to the file or directory you want to see the Code Owners for.
    4. Optional. Select a branch or tag.
  GitLab shows the Code Owners at the top of the page.
