description: |
  Manage all code projects in a version control platform.
rationale: |
  Version control platforms keep track of every modification to code. They represent the 
  cornerstone of code security, as well as allowing for better code collaboration within 
  engineering teams. With granular access management, change tracking, and key 
  signing of code edits, version control platforms are the first step in securing the software 
  supply chain.
audit: |
  Ensure that all code activity is managed in a GitLab repository for every micro-
  service or application developed by your organization.

remediation: |
  Upload existing code projects to a Gitlab group or instance and create an identity for 
  each active team member who might contribute or need access to it.
