title: Ensure all public repositories contain a SECURITY.md file
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: repository_management
description: >-
  A SECURITY.md file is a security policy file that offers instruction on reporting security 
  vulnerabilities in a project. When someone creates an issue within a specific project, a 
  link to the SECURITY.md file will subsequently be shown.
rationale: >-
  A SECURITY.md file provides users with crucial security information. It can also serve 
  an important role in project maintenance, encouraging users to think ahead about how 
  to properly handle potential security issues, updates, and general security practices.
impact: >-
audit: |
  Verify that each public repository has a SECURITY.md file by performing the following:
    • Navigate to the main page of a GitLab repository.
    • Verify that the repository has a SECURITY.md file with crucial security information at the top-level.
remediation: |
  Ensure that each public repository has a SECURITY.md file by performing the following:
    • Navigate to the main page of a repository without a SECURITY.md file in GitLab.
    • Create a SECURITY.md file (in the web UI or locally) with security information like supported versions of your project and how to report a vulnerability.
    • Commit this file to the repository and push your changes.
    • If you open a merge request to add the SECURITY.md file, make sure this change is merged to your repository's default branch.

    name: Establish and Maintain a Process to Accept and Address Software Vulnerabilities
    description: >-
      Establish and maintain a process to accept and address reports of software 
      vulnerabilities, including providing a means for external entities to report. The 
      process is to include such items as: a vulnerability handling policy that identifies 
      reporting process, responsible party for handling vulnerability reports, and a process 
      for intake, assignment, remediation, and remediation testing. As part of the process, 
      use a vulnerability tracking system that includes severity ratings, and metrics for 
      measuring timing for identification, analysis, and remediation of 
      vulnerabilities. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant 
      enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. Third-party application 
      developers need to consider this an externally-facing policy that helps to set 
      expectations for outside stakeholders.
