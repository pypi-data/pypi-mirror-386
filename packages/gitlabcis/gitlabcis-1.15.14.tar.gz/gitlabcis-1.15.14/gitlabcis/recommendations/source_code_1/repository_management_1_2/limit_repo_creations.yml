title: Ensure repository creation is limited to specific members
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: repository_management
description: >-
  Limit the ability to create repositories to trusted users and teams.
rationale: >-
  Restricting repository creation to trusted users and teams is recommended in order to 
  keep the organization properly structured, track fewer items, prevent impersonation, and 
  to not overload the version-control system. It will allow administrators easier source 
  code tracking and management capabilities, as they will have fewer repositories to 
  track. The process of detecting potential attacks also becomes far more straightforward, 
  as well, since the easier it is to track the source code, the easier it is to detect malicious 
  acts within it. Additionally, the possibility of a member creating a public repository and 
  sharing the organization's data externally is significantly decreased.
impact: >-
  Specific users will not be permitted to create repositories.
audit: |
  Verify that only trusted users and teams can create repositories by performing the following. As an administrator:
    • Navigate to the Admin Area
    • In the sidebar, select Settings > General
    • Expand the Sign-up restrictions section
    • If 'Sign up enabled' is disabled, the instance is compliant.
    • If 'Sign-up enabled' and 'Require admin approval for new sign-ups' are selected, and if 'Email confirmation settings' is set to Hard, the instance is compliant.

    name: Protect Information through Access Control Lists
    description: >-
      Protect all information stored on systems with file system, network share, 
      claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will 
      enforce the principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the 
      information based on their need to access the information as a part of their 
      responsibilities.
