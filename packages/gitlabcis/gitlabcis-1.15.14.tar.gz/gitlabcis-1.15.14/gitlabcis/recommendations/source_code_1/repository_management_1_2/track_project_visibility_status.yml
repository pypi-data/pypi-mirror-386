title: Ensure all code projects are tracked for changes in visibility status
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: repository_management
description: >-
  Ensure every change in visibility of projects is tracked.
rationale: >-
  Visibility of projects determines who can access a project and/or fork it: anyone, 
  designated users, or only members of the organization. If a private project becomes 
  public, this may point to a potential attack, which can ultimately lead to data loss, the 
  leaking of sensitive information, and finally to a supply chain attack. It is crucial to track 
  these changes in order to prevent such incidents.

  Ensure that every change in project visibility is investigated by performing the following regularly. As an administrator:
    • Navigate to the Admin Area.
    • In the sidebar, select Monitoring > Audit Events.
    • Review the log for Actions with the content 'Changed visibility from Private to Public' or 'Changed visibility from Internal to Public'.
    • Ensure every change is reasonable and secure and is investigated if it is not.

    • (Optional) Use Instance Audit Event Streaming (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_event_streaming/#instance-streaming-destinations) to send visibility change events to a third party alerting tool. Integrate these alerts in to your change management and/or incident response processes.

    name: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory
    description: >-
      Establish and maintain a detailed inventory of all licensed software installed on 
      enterprise assets. The software inventory must document the title, publisher, initial 
      install/use date, and business purpose for each entry; where appropriate, include 
      the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), app store(s), version(s), deployment 
      mechanism, and decommission date. Review and update the software inventory bi-
      annually, or more frequently.
