title: Ensure issue deletion is limited to specific users

description: >-
  Ensure only trusted and responsible users can delete issues.
rationale: >-
  Issues are a way to keep track of things happening in repositories, such as setting new 
  milestones or requesting urgent fixes. Deleting an issue is not a benign activity, as it 
  might harm the development workflow or attempt to hide malicious behavior. Because 
  of this, it should be restricted and allowed only by trusted and responsible users.
impact: >-
  Certain users will not be permitted to delete issues.
audit: |
  Verify that only a limited number of trusted users can delete issues by performing either of the following steps:
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • Select Manage > Members.
    • At the top of the member list, from the dropdown list, select Max role the members have in the group and descending order.
    • If there are minimum number of members with Owner/Maintainer role in the list, you are compliant.
remediation: |
  Enforce issue deletion by a few trusted and responsible users only by performing either of the following steps:
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • Select Manage > Members.
    • At the top of the member list, from the dropdown list, select Max role the members have in the group and descending order.
    • Next to the project member you want to remove, select Remove member.
default_value: Only organization owners or members with admin privileges can delete issues.
