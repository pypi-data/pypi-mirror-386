title: Ensure all copies (forks) of code are tracked and accounted for
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: repository_management
description: >-
  Track every fork of code and ensure it is accounted for.
rationale: >-
  A fork is a copy of a repository. On top of being a plain copy, any updates to the original 
  repository itself can be pulled and reflected by the fork under certain conditions. A large 
  number of repository copies (forks) become difficult to manage and properly secure. 
  New and sensitive changes can often be pushed into a critical repository without 
  developer knowledge of an updated copy of the very same repository. If there is no limit 
  on doing this, then it is recommended to track and delete copies of organization 
  repositories as needed.
impact: >-
  Disabling forks completely may slow down the development process as more actions 
  will be necessary to take in order to fork a repository.

    name: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory
    description: >-
      Establish and maintain a detailed inventory of all licensed software installed on 
      enterprise assets. The software inventory must document the title, publisher, initial 
      install/use date, and business purpose for each entry; where appropriate, include 
      the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), app store(s), version(s), deployment 
      mechanism, and decommission date. Review and update the software inventory bi- 
      annually, or more frequently
