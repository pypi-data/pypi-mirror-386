# 1.2 Repository Management

This section consists of security recommendations for proper code repository management.

Code repositories are where the application code is stored and organized. It is important to keep code repositories organized and maintained to avoid data loss, data theft and other attacks that may happen unknowingly when a repository is not maintained well. The recommendations of this section are setting guides to do so.
