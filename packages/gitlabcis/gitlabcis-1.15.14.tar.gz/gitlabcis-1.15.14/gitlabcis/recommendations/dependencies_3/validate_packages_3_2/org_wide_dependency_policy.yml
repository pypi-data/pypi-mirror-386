title: Ensure an organization-wide dependency usage policy is enforced
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: validate_packages
description: >-
  Enforce a policy for dependency usage across the organization. For example, disallow 
  the use of packages less than 60 days old.
rationale: >-
  Enforcing a policy for dependency usage in an organization helps to manage 
  dependencies across the organization and ensure that all usage is compliant with 
  security policy. If, for example, the policy limits the package managers that can be used, 
  enforcing it will make sure that every dependency is installed only from these package 
  managers, and limit the risk of installing from any untrusted source.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Verify that a policy for dependency usage is enforced across the organization.
remediation: >-
  Enforce policies for dependency usage across the organization.
