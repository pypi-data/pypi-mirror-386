title: Ensure packages are automatically scanned for ownership change
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: validate_packages
description: >-
  Scan every package automatically for ownership change.
rationale: >-
  A change in package ownership is not a regular action. In some cases it can lead to a 
  massive problem (for example, the "event-stream" incident). Open-source contributors 
  are not always trusted, since by its very nature everyone can contribute. This means 
  malicious actors can become contributors as well. Package maintainers might transfer 
  their ownership to someone they do not know if maintaining the package is too much for 
  them, in some cases without the other user's knowledge. This has led to known security 
  breaches in the past. It is best to be aware of such activity as soon as it happens and to 
  carefully examine the situation before continuing using the package in order to 
  determine its safety.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Ensure automatic scanning of packages for ownership change is set.
remediation: >-
  Set automatic scanning of packages for ownership change.
