title: Ensure third-party artifacts and open-source libraries are verified
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: third_party_packages
description: >-
  Ensure third-party artifacts and open-source libraries in use are trusted and verified.
rationale: >-
  Verify third-party artifacts used in code are trusted and have not been infected by a 
  malicious actor before use. This can be accomplished, for example, by comparing the 
  checksum of the dependency to its checksum in a trusted source. If a difference arises, 
  this may be a sign that someone interfered and added malicious code. If this 
  dependency is used, it will infect the environment and could end in a massive breach, 
  leaving the organization exposed to data leaks and more.

audit: >-
  Ensure third-party artifacts and open-source libraries are verified.
remediation: >-
  Set third-party artifacts and open-source libraries to be verified.
