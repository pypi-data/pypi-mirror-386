title: Ensure all packages used are more than 60 days old
profile: 2
category: dependencies
sub_category: third_party_packages
description: >-
  Use packages that are more than 60 days old.
rationale: >-
  Third-party packages are a major risk since an organization cannot control their source 
  code, and there is always the possibility these packages could be malicious. It is 
  therefore good practice to remain cautious with any third-party or open-source package, 
  especially new ones, until they can be verified that they are safe to use. Avoiding a new 
  package allows the organization to fully examine it, its maintainer, and its behavior, and 
  gives enough time to determine whether or not to use it.
impact: >-
  Developers may not use packages that are less than 60 days old.
audit: >-
  For every package used, ensure it is more than 60 days old.
remediation: >-
  If a package used is less than 60 days old, stop using it and find another solution.
