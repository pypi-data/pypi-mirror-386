title: Ensure signed metadata of the build process is required and verified
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: third_party_packages
description: >-
  Require and verify signed metadata of the build process for all dependencies in use.
rationale: >-
  The metadata of a build process lists every action that took place during an artifact 
  build. It is used to ensure that an artifact has not been compromised during the build, 
  that no malicious code was injected into it, and that no nefarious dependencies were 
  added during the build phase. This creates trust between user and vendor that the 
  software supplied is exactly the software that was promised. Signing this metadata adds 
  a checksum to ensure there have been no revisions since its creation, as this checksum 
  changes when the metadata is altered. Verification of proper metadata signature with 
  Certificate Authority confirms that the signature was produced by a trusted entity.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each artifact used, ensure it was supplied with verified and signed metadata of its 
  build process. The signature should be the organizational signature and should be 
  verifiable by common Certificate Authority servers.
remediation: >-
  For each artifact in use, require and verify signed metadata of the build process.
