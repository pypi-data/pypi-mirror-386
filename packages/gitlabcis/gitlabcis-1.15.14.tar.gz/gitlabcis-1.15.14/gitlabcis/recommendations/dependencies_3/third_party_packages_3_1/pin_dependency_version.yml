title: Ensure dependencies are pinned to a specific, verified version
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: third_party_packages
description: >-
  Pin dependencies to a specific version. Avoid using the "latest" tag or broad version.
rationale: >-
  When using a wildcard version of a package, or the "latest" tag, the risk of encountering 
  a new, potentially malicious package increases. The "latest" tag pulls the last package 
  pushed to the registry. This means that if an attacker pushes a new, malicious package 
  successfully to the registry, the next user who pulls the "latest" will pull it and risk attack. 
  This same rule applies to a wildcard version - assuming one is using version v1.*, it will 
  install the latest version of the major version 1, meaning that if an attacker can push a 
  malicious package with that same version, those using it will be subject to possible 
  attack. By using a secure, verified version, use is restricted to this version only and no 
  other may be pulled, decreasing the risk for any malicious package.

  For every dependency in use, ensure it is pinned to a specific version.

  For every dependency in use, pin to a specific version.
