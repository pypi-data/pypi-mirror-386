# 4 Artifacts

This section consists of security recommendations for the management of artifacts produced by build pipelines, as well as ones used by the application in the build process itself.

Artifacts are packaged versions of software. They are stored in package registries (or artifact managers) and require securing from the moment they are created, through the time they are copied and updated, and up to deployment to their relevant environment.
