# 4.3 Package Registries

This section consists of security recommendations for management of package registries and artifacts that are stored in them.

Package registries are where the organization artifacts are stored. To keep an artifact safe, you must keep the registry where it is stored safe too. furthermore, you need to ensure that every artifact that reaches the registry is safe to use and doesn't put the registry in danger.
