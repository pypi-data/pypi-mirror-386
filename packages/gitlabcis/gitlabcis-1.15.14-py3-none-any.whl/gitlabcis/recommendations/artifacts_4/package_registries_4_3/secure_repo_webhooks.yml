title: Ensure webhooks of the repository are secured
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: package_registries
description: >-
  Use secured webhooks to reduce the possibility of malicious payloads.
rationale: >-
  Webhooks are used for triggering an HTTP request based on an action made in the 
  platform. Typically, package registries feature webhooks when a package receives an 
  update. Since webhooks are an HTTP POST request, they can be malformed if not 
  secured over SSL. To prevent a potential hack and compromise of the webhook or to 
  the registry or web server excepting the request, use only secured webhooks.
impact: >-
  Reduces the payloads that the web hook can listen for and receive.
audit: >-
remediation: >-
  For each webhook in use, change it to secured (over HTTPS).
