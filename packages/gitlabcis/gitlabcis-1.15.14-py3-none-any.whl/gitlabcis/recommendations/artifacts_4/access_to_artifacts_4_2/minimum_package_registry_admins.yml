title: Ensure minimum number of administrators are set for the package registry
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: access_to_artifacts
description: >-
  Ensure the package registry has a minimum number of administrators.
rationale: >-
  Package registry admins have the ability to add/remove users, repositories, packages. 
  Due to the permissive access granted to an admin, it is highly recommended to keep 
  the number of administrator accounts as minimal as possible.
impact: >-
  Administrator privileges are required to provide and maintain a secure and stable 
  platform but allowing extraneous administrator accounts can create a vulnerability.
audit: >-
  Verify that your package registry has only the minimum number of administrators. For 
  each project that you administer on GitLab, you can see every team or person with 
  access to the project. Project-level permissions determine actions such as downloading, 
  pushing, or deleting packages.
remediation: >-
  Set the minimum number of administrators in your package registry. To accomplish this: 
  For each project that you administer on GitLab, you can see an overview of every team 
  or person with access to the repository. Provide access to the appropriate people or 
  teams.

    name: Ensure the Use of Dedicated Administrative Accounts
    description: >-
      Ensure that all users with administrative account access use a dedicated or
