title: Ensure the authority to certify artifacts is limited
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: access_to_artifacts
description: >-
  Software certification is used to verify the safety of certain software usage and to 
  establish trust between the supplier and the consumer. Any artifact can be certified. 
  Limit the authority to certify different artifacts.
rationale: >-
  Artifact certification is a powerful tool in establishing trust. Clients use a software 
  certificate to verify that the artifact is safe to use according to their security policies. 
  Because of this, certifying artifacts is considered sensitive. If an artifact is for debugging 
  or internal use, or if it were compromised, the organization would not want certification. 
  An attacker gaining access to both certificate authority and the artifact registry might 
  also be able to certify its own artifact and cause a major breach. To prevent these 
  issues, limit which artifacts can be certified by which platform so there will be minimal 
  access to certification.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Ensure only certain artifacts can be certified by certain parties.
remediation: >-
  Limit which artifact can be certified by which authority.

    name: Protect Information through Access Control Lists
    description: >-
      Protect all information stored on systems with file system, network share, 
      claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will 
      enforce the principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the 
      information based on their need to access the information as a part of their 
      responsibilities.
