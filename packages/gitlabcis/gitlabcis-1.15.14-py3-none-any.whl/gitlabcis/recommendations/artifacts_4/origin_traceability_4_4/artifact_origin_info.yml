title: Ensure artifacts contain information about their origin
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: origin_traceability
description: >-
  When delivering artifacts, ensure they have information about their origin. This may be 
  done by providing a Software Bill of Manufacture (SBOM) or some metadata files.
rationale: >-
  Information about artifact origin can be used for verification purposes. Having this kind 
  of information allows the user to decide if the organization supplying the artifact is 
  trusted. In a case of potential vulnerability or version update, this can be used to verify 
  that the organization issuing it is the actual origin and not someone else. If users need 
  to report problems with the artifact, they will have an address to contact as well.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each artifact, ensure it has information about its origin.
remediation: >-
  For each artifact supplied, supply information about its origin. For each artifact in use, 
  ask for information about its origin.

    name: Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory
    description: >-
      Establish and maintain an accurate, detailed, and up-to-date inventory of all 
      enterprise assets with the potential to store or process data, to include: end-user 
      devices (including portable and mobile), network devices, non-computing/IoT 
      devices, and servers. Ensure the inventory records the network address (if static), 
      hardware address, machine name, enterprise asset owner, department for each 
      asset, and whether the asset has been approved to connect to the network. For 
      mobile end-user devices, MDM type tools can support this process, where 
      appropriate. This inventory includes assets connected to the infrastructure 
      physically, virtually, remotely, and those within cloud environments. Additionally, it 
      includes assets that are regularly connected to the enterprise's etwork 
      infrastructure, even if they are not under control of the enterprise. Review and 
      update the inventory of all enterprise assets bi-annually, or more frequently.
