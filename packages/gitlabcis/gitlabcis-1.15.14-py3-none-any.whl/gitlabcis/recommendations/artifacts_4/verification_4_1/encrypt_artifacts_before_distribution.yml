title: Ensure artifacts are encrypted before distribution
profile: 1
category: artifacts
sub_category: verification
description: >-
  Encrypt artifacts before they are distributed and ensure only trusted platforms have 
  decryption capabilities.
rationale: >-
  Build artifacts might contain sensitive data such as production configurations. In order to 
  protect them and decrease the risk for breach, it is recommended to encrypt them 
  before delivery. Encryption makes data unreadable, so even if attackers gain access to 
  these artifacts, they won't be able to harvest sensitive data from them without the 
  decryption key.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Ensure every artifact is encrypted before it is delivered.
remediation: >-
  Encrypt every artifact before distribution.
default_value: Artifacts do not get encrypted by default.

    name: Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest
    description: >-
      Encrypt sensitive data at rest on servers, applications, and databases containing 
      sensitive data. Storage-layer encryption, also known as server-side encryption, 
      meets the minimum requirement of this Safeguard. Additional encryption methods 
      may include application-layer encryption, also known as client-side encryption, 
      where access to the data storage device(s) does not permit access to the plain-text 
      data.

    description: >-
      Encrypt all sensitive information at rest using a tool that requires a secondary 
      authentication mechanism not integrated into the operating system, in order to 
      access the information.
