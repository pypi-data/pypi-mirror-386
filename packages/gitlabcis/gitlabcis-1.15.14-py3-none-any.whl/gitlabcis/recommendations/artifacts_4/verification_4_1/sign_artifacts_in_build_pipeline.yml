title: Ensure all artifacts are signed by the build pipeline itself
profile: 2
category: artifacts
sub_category: verification
description: >-
  Configure the build pipeline to sign every artifact it produces and verify that each artifact 
  has the appropriate signature.
rationale: >-
  A cryptographic signature can be used to verify artifact authenticity. The signature 
  created with a certain key is unique and not reversible, thus making it unique to the 
  author. This means that an attacker tampering with a signed artifact will be noticed 
  immediately using a simple verification step because the signature will change. Signing 
  artifacts by the build pipeline that produces them ensures the integrity of those artifacts.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Verify that the build pipeline signs every new artifact it produces and all artifacts are signed. 
  There are many different signing tools or options each have there own method or 
  commands to verify that the code or package created is signed.
remediation: >-
  Sign every artifact produced with the build pipeline that created it. Configure the build 
  pipeline to sign each artifact.
default_value: Artifacts are not signed by Default.
