title: Ensure deployments are automated
profile: 1
category: deployment
sub_category: deployment_environment
description: >-
  Automate deployments of production environment and application.
rationale: >-
  Automating the deployments of both production environment and applications reduces 
  the risk for human mistakes — such as a wrong configuration or exposure of sensitive 
  data — because it requires less human interaction or intervention. It also eases 
  redeployment of the environment. It is best to automate with Infrastructure as Code 
  (IaC) because it offers more control over changes made to the environment creation 
  configuration and stores to a version control platform.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each deployment process, ensure it is automated.
remediation: >-
  Automate each deployment process of the production environment and application.
