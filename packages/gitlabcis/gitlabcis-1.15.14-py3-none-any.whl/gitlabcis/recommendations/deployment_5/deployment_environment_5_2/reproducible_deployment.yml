title: Ensure the deployment environment is reproducible
profile: 1
category: deployment
sub_category: deployment_environment
description: >-
  Verify that the deployment environment - the orchestrator and the production 
  environment where the application is deployed - is reproducible. This means that the 
  environment stays the same in each deployment if the configuration has not changed.
rationale: >-
  A reproducible build is a build that produces the same artifact when given the same 
  input data, and in this case the same environment. Ensuring that the same environment 
  is produced when given the same input helps verify that no change has been made to it. 
  This action allows an organization to trust that its deployment environment is built only 
  from safe code and configuration that has been reviewed and tested and has not been 
  tainted or changed abruptly.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Verify that the deployment/production environment is reproducible.
remediation: >-
  Adjust the process that deploys the deployment/production environment to build the 
  same environment each time when the configuration has not changed.
