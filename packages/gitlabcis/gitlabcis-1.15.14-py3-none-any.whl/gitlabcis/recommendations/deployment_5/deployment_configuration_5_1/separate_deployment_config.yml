description: >-
  Deployment configurations are often stored in a version control system. Separate 
  deployment configuration files from source code repositories.
rationale: >-
  Deployment configuration manifests are often stored in version control systems. Storing 
  them in dedicated repositories, separately from source code repositories, has several 
  benefits. First, it adds order to both maintenance and version control history. This 
  makes it easier to track code or manifest changes, as well as spot any malicious code 
  or misconfigurations. Second, it helps achieve the Least Privilege principle. Because 
  access can be configured differently for each repository, fewer users will have access to 
  this configuration, which is typically sensitive.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Ensure each deployment configuration file is stored separately from source code.
remediation: >-
  Store each deployment configuration file in a dedicated repository separately from 
  source code.
