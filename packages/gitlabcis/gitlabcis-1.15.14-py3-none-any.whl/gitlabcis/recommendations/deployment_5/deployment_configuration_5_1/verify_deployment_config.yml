description: >-
  Verify the deployment configuration manifests.
rationale: >-
  To ensure that the configuration manifests used are trusted and have not been infected 
  by malicious actors before arriving at the platform, it is important to verify the manifests. 
  This may be done by comparing the checksum of the manifest file to its checksum in a 
  trusted source. If a difference arises, this is a sign that an unknown actor has interfered 
  and may have added malicious instructions. If this manifest is used, it might harm the 
  environment and application deployment, which could end in a massive breach and 
  leave the organization exposed to data leaks, etc.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each deployment configuration manifest in use, ensure it has been verified.
remediation: >-
  Verify each deployment configuration manifest in use.
