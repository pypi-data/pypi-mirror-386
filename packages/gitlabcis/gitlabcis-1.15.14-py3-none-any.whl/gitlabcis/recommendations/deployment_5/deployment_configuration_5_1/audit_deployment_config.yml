description: >-
  Audit and track changes made in deployment configuration.
rationale: >-
  Deployment configuration is sensitive in nature. The tiniest mistake can lead to 
  downtime or bugs in production, which consequently may have a direct effect on both 
  product integrity and customer trust. Misconfigurations might also be used by malicious 
  actors to attack the production platform. Because of this, every change in the 
  configuration needs a review and possible "revert" in case of a mistake or malicious 
  change. Auditing every change and tracking them helps detect and fix such incidents 
  more quickly.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each deployment configuration, ensure changes made to it are audited and tracked.
remediation: >-
  For each deployment configuration, track and audit changes made to it.
