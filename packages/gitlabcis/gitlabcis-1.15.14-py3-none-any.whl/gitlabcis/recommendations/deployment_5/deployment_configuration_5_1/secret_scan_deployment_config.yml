title: Ensure scanners are in place to identify and prevent sensitive data in deployment configuration
profile: 1
category: deployment
sub_category: deployment_configuration
description: >-
  Detect and prevent sensitive data - such as confidential ID numbers, passwords, etc. -
  in deployment configurations.
rationale: >-
  Sensitive data in deployment configurations might create a major incident if an attacker 
  gains access to it, as this can cause data loss and theft. It is important to keep sensitive 
  data safe and to not expose it in the configuration. In order to prevent a possible 
  exposure, set scanners that will identify and prevent such data in deployment 
  configurations.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each deployment configuration file, verify that scanners are set to identify and 
  prevent the existence of sensitive data within it.
remediation: >-
  For each deployment configuration file, set scanners to identify and prevent sensitive 
  data within it.
