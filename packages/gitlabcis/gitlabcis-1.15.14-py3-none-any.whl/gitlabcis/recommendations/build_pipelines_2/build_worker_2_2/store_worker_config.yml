title: Ensure build workers' deployment configuration is stored in a version control platform
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: build_worker
description: >-
  Store the deployment configuration of build workers in a version control platform, such 
  as GitLab.
rationale: >-
  Build workers are a sensitive part of the build phase. They generally have access to the 
  code repository, the Continuous Integration platform, the deployment platform, etc. This 
  means that an attacker gaining access to a build worker may compromise other 
  platforms in the organization and cause a major incident. One thing that can protect 
  workers is to ensure that their deployment configuration is safe and well-configured. 
  Storing the deployment configuration in version control enables more observability of 
  these configurations because everything is catalogued in a single place. It adds another 
  layer of security, as every change will be reviewed and noticed, and thus malicious 
  changes will theoretically occur less. In the case of a mistake, bug, or security incident, 
  it also offers an easier way to "revert" back to a safe version or add a "hot fix" quickly.
impact: >-
  Changes in deployment configuration may only be applied by declaration in the version 
  control platform. This could potentially slow down the development process.
audit: |
  Verify that the deployment configuration of build workers is stored in a version control platform.
    • On the left sidebar, select Code > Repository.
    • Check if a .gitlab-ci.yml file is at the root of your repository.
remediation: |
  Document and store every deployment configuration of build workers in a version control platform.
    • On the left sidebar, select Code > Repository.
    • Above the file list, select the branch you want to commit to. If you're not sure, leave master or main. Then select the plus icon () and New file:
    • For the Filename, type .gitlab-ci.yml.
    • Select Commit changes.

    name: Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process
    description: >-
      Establish and maintain a secure configuration process for enterprise assets 
      (end-user devices, including portable and mobile, non-computing/IoT devices, and 
      servers) and software (operating systems and applications). Review and update 
      documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could 
      impact this Safeguard.
