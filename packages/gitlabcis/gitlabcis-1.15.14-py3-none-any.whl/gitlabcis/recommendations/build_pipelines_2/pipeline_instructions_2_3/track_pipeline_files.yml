description: >-
  Track and review changes to pipeline files.
rationale: >-
  Pipeline files are sensitive files. They have the ability to access sensitive data and 
  control the build process, thus it is just as important to review changes to pipeline files 
  as it is to verify source code. Malicious actors can potentially add harmful code to these 
  files, which may lead to sensitive data exposure and hijacking of the build environment 
  or artifacts.

  For each pipeline file, ensure changes to it are being tracked and reviewed.
    • On the left sidebar, select Code > Repository.
    • Check if a .gitlab-ci.yml file is at the root of your repository
    • If it exists, all changes will be tracked via Git.
    • In the upper-right corner, select History to review the history of the gitlab-ci.yml file
