title: Ensure pipelines are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: pipeline_instructions
description: >-
  Scan pipelines for vulnerabilities. It is recommended that this be implemented 
  automatically.
rationale: >-
  Automatic scanning for vulnerabilities detects known vulnerabilities in pipeline 
  instructions and components, allowing faster patching in case one is found. These 
  vulnerabilities can lead to a potentially massive breach if not handled as fast as 
  possible, as attackers might also be aware of such vulnerabilities.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each pipeline, verify that it is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities.
remediation: >-
  For each pipeline, set automated vulnerability scanning.
