title: Ensure all artifacts on all releases are signed
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: pipeline_integrity
description: >-
  Sign all artifacts in all releases with user or organization keys.
rationale: >-
  Signing artifacts is used to validate both their integrity and security. Organizations signal 
  that artifacts may be trusted and they themselves produced them by ensuring that every 
  artifact is properly signed. The presence of this signature also makes potentially 
  malicious activity far more difficult.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Ensure every artifact in every release is signed.
remediation: >-
  For every artifact in every release, verify that all are properly signed.
