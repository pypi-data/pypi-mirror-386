title: Ensure pipeline steps sign the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) produced
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: pipeline_integrity
description: >-
  SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is a file that specifies each component of software or 
  a build process. It should be generated after every pipeline run. After it is generated, it 
  must then be signed.
rationale: >-
  Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a file used to validate the integrity and security of a 
  build pipeline. Signing it ensures that no one tampered with the file when it was 
  delivered. Such interference can happen if someone tries to hide unusual activity. 
  Validating the SBOM signature can detect this activity and prevent much greater 
  incident.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each pipeline, ensure it signs the Software Bill of Materials it produces on every run.
remediation: >-
  For each pipeline, configure it to sign its produced Software Bill of Materials on every run.
