title: Ensure access to build environments is limited
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: build_environment
description: >-
  Restrict access to the build environment (orchestrator, pipeline executor, their 
  environment, etc.) to trusted and qualified users only.
rationale: >-
  A build environment contains sensitive data such as environment variables, secrets, 
  and the source code itself. Any user that has access to this environment can make 
  changes to the build process, including changes to the code within it. Restricting access 
  to the build environment to trusted and qualified users only will reduce the risk for 
  mistakes such as exposure of secrets or misconfiguration. Limiting access also reduces 
  the number of accounts that are vulnerable to hijacking in order to potentially harm the 
  build environment.
impact: >-
  Reducing the number of users who have access to the build process means those
  users would lose their ability to make direct changes to that process.
audit: |
  Verify each build environment is accessible only to known and authorized users.
  In GitLab, viewing environments in private projects is limited to Reporter roles at least and you must have at least the Developer role to create a new environment
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • Select Manage > Members.
    • At the top of the member list, from the dropdown list, select Max role the members have in the group and descending order.
    • If there are minimum number of members with Reporter/Developer role or above in the list, you are compliant.

    name: Protect Information through Access Control Lists
    description: >-
      Protect all information stored on systems with file system, network share, claims,
      application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will enforce the
      principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the information
      based on their need to access the information as a part of their responsibilities.
