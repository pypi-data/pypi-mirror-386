title: Ensure all aspects of the pipeline infrastructure and configuration are immutable
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: build_environment
description: >-
  Ensure the pipeline orchestrator and its configuration are immutable.
rationale: >-
  An immutable infrastructure is one that cannot be changed during execution of the 
  pipeline. This can be done, for example, by using Infrastructure as Code for configuring 
  the pipeline and the pipeline environment. Utilizing such infrastructure creates a more 
  predictable environment because updates will require re-deployment to prevent any 
  previous configuration from interfering. Because it is dependent on automation, it is 
  easier to revert changes. Testing code is also simpler because it is based on 
  virtualization. Most importantly, an immutable pipeline infrastructure ensures that a 
  potential attacker seeking to compromise the build environment itself would not be able 
  to do so if the orchestrator, its configuration, and any other component cannot be 
  changed. Verifying that all aspects of the pipeline infrastructure and configuration are 
  immutable therefore keeps them safe from malicious tampering attempts.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Verify that the pipeline orchestrator, its configuration, and all other aspects of the build 
  environment are immutable.
remediation: >-
  Use an immutable pipeline orchestrator and ensure that its configuration and all other 
  aspects of the built environment are immutable, as well.

    name: Establish and Maintain a Secure Application Development Process
    description: >-
      Establish and maintain a secure application development process. In the 
      process, address such items as: secure application design standards, secure coding 
      practices, developer training, vulnerability management, security of third-party code, 
      and application security testing procedures. Review and update documentation 
      annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this 
      Safeguard.

    description: >-
      Establish and maintain a penetration testing program appropriate to the size, 
      complexity, and maturity of the enterprise. Penetration testing program 
      characteristics include scope, such as network, web application, Application 
      Programming Interface (API), hosted services, and physical premise controls; 
      frequency; limitations, such as acceptable hours, and excluded attack types; point of 
      contact information; remediation, such as how findings will be routed internally; and 
      retrospective requirements.
