title: Ensure users must authenticate to access the build environment
profile: 1
category: build_pipelines
sub_category: build_environment
description: >-
  Require users to login in to access the build environment - where the orchestrator, the
  pipeline executer, where the build workers are running, etc.
rationale: >-
  Requiring users to authenticate and disabling anonymous access to the build 
  environment allows organization to track every action on that environment, good or bad, 
  to its actor. This will help recognizing attack and its attacker becuase the authentication 
  is required.
impact: >-
  Anonymous users won't be able to access the build environment.
audit: |
  Ensure authentication is required to access the build environment.
  In GitLab, viewing environments in private projects is limited to Reporter roles at least and you must have at least the Developer role to create a new environment. Both require prior authentication.
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • Select Manage > Members.
    • At the top of the member list, from the dropdown list, select Max role the members have in the group and descending order.
    • If there are minimum number of members with Reporter/Developer role or above in the list, you are compliant.
