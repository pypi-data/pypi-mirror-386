title: Ensure minimum number of administrators are set for the build environment
profile: 1

description: >-
  Ensure the build environment has a minimum number of administrators.
rationale: >-
  Build environment administrators have the highest level of permissions, including the 
  ability to add/remove users, create or delete pipelines, control build workers, change 
  build trigger permissions and more. Due to the permissive access granted to a build 
  environment administrator, it is highly recommended to keep the number of 
  administrator accounts as minimal as possible.
