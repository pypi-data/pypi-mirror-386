description: >-
  Detect and prevent misconfigurations and insecure instructions in CI pipelines
rationale: >-
  Detecting and fixing misconfigurations or insecure instructions in CI pipelines decreases 
  the risk for a successful attack through or on the CI pipeline. The more secure the 
  pipeline, the less risk there is for potential exposure of sensitive data, a deployment 
  being compromised, or external access mistakenly being granted to the CI infrastructure 
  or the source code.
impact: >-
audit: |
  For every project:
    • Identify if one or more CI configuration files exist
    • Review CI configuration files for misconfigurations or insecure instructions
    • Review whether the absence of any CI configuration is itself a misconfiguration
remediation: |
  For every project identified during the Audit as having misconfigured or insecure CI instructions:
    • Update the CI instructions
    • Consider using Scan Execution Policies at the project or group level to enforce security scans
    • Consider using the Compliance Framework feature to enforce pipeline configuration
    • Consider procuring and enabling a CI instructions scanning tool to identify and
    prevent misconfigurations and insecure instructions and scans all CI pipelines.
