title: Ensure scanners are in place for open-source vulnerabilities in used packages
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: code_risks
description: >-
  Detect, prevent and monitor known open-source vulnerabilities in packages that are 
  being used.
rationale: >-
  Open-source vulnerabilities might exist before one starts to use a package, but they are 
  also discovered over time. New attacks and vulnerabilities are announced every now 
  and then. It is important to keep track of these and to monitor whether the dependencies 
  used are affected by the recent vulnerability. Detecting and fixing those packages' 
  vulnerabilities decreases the attack surface within deployed and running applications 
  that use such packages. It prevents security flaws from reaching the production 
  environment which could eventually lead to a security breach.

audit: |
  For every repository that is in use, verify that a dependency scanning tool is set to detect, prevent, and monitor vulnerabilities in project dependencies by performing the following:
    1. On GitLab, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    2. Review the CI pipeline configuration to verify that Dependency Scanning has been configured to run on this project.

    description: >-
      Use up-to-date and trusted third-party software components. When possible, 
      choose established and proven frameworks and libraries that provide adequate 
      security. Acquire these components from trusted sources or evaluate the software 
      for vulnerabilities before use.

  GitLab Dependency Scanning is only available in GitLab Ultimate. If you're not 
  using GitLab Ultimate, consider using a free open-source dependency scanner as part 
  of your CI pipeline.
