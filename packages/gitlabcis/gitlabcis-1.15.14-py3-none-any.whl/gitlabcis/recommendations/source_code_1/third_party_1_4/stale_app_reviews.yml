title: Ensure stale applications are reviewed and inactive ones are removed
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: third_party
description: >-
  Ensure stale (inactive) applications are reviewed and removed if no longer in use.
rationale: >-
  Applications that have been inactive for a long period of time are enlarging the surface 
  of attack for data leaks. They are more likely to be improperly managed, and could 
  possibly be accessed by third-party developers as a tool for collecting internal data of 
  the organization or repository in which they are installed. It is important to remove these 
  inactive applications as soon as possible.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Verify that all the applications in the organization are actively used, and remove those 
  that are no longer in use. Ensure that Dependency scanning is enabled, which enables 
  Continuous Vulnerability scanning by default and identifies vulnerabilities applications, 
  even if they are stale.
remediation: |
  1. Review all stale applications and periodically remove them.
  2. Enable dependency scanning to automatically detect vulnerabilities in stale applications.
  3. Add the following to your .gitlab-ci.yml file:
      include:
        - template: Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

    name: Ensure Authorized Software is Currently Supported
    description: >-
      Ensure that only currently supported software is designated as authorized in the 
      software inventory for enterprise assets. If software is unsupported, yet necessary 
      for the fulfillment of the enterprise's mission, document an exception detailing 
      mitigating controls and residual risk acceptance. For any unsupported software 
      without an exception documentation, designate as unauthorized. Review the 
      software list to verify software support at least monthly, or more frequently.
