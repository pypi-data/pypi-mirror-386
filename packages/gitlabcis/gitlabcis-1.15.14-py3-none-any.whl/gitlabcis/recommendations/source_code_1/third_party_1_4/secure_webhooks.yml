  A webhook is an event listener, attached to critical and sensitive parts of the software 
  delivery process. It is triggered by a list of events (such as a new code being 
  committed), and when triggered, the webhook sends out a notification with some 
  payload to specific internet endpoints. Since the payload of the webhook contains 
  sensitive organization data, it's important all webhooks are directed to an endpoint 
  (URL) protected by SSL verification (HTTPS). This helps ensure that the data sent is 
  delivered to securely without any man-in-the-middle, who could easily access and even 
  alter the payload of the request.
