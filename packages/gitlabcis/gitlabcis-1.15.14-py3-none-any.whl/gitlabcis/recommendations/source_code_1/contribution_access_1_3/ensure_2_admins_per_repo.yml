title: Ensure two administrators are set for each repository
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: contribution_access
description: >-
  Ensure every repository has two users with administrative permissions.
rationale: >-
  Repository administrators have the highest permissions to said repository. These 
  include the ability to add/remove collaborators, change branch protection policy, and 
  convert to a publicly-accessible repository. Due to the liberal access granted to a 
  repository administrator, it is highly recommended that only two contributors occupy this 
  role.
impact: >-
  Removing administrative users from a repository would result in them losing high-level 
  access to that repository.

    name: Protect Information through Access Control Lists
    description: >-
      Protect all information stored on systems with file system, network share, 
      claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will 
      enforce the principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the 
      information based on their need to access the information as a part of their 
      responsibilities.
