title: Ensure top-level group creation is limited to specific members
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: contribution_access
description: >-
  Limit ability to create teams to trusted and specific users.
rationale: >-
  The ability to create new teams should be restricted to specific members in order to 
  keep the organization orderly and ensure users have access to only the lowest privilege 
  level necessary. Teams typically inherit permissions from their parent team, thus if base 
  permissions are less restricted and any user has the ability to create a team, a 
  permission leverage could occur in which certain data is made available to users who 
  should not have access to it. Such a situation could potentially lead to the creation of 
  shadow teams by an attacker. Restricting team creation will also reduce additional 
  clutter in the organizational structure, and as a result will make it easier to track 
  changes and anomalies.
impact: >-
  Only specific users will be able to create new teams.
