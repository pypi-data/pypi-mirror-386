title: Ensure an organization's identity is confirmed with a “Verified” badge
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: contribution_access
description: >-
  Confirm the domains an organization owns with a "Verified" badge.
rationale: >-
  Verifying the organization's domain gives developers assurance that a given domain is 
  truly the official home for a public organization. Attackers can pretend to be an 
  organization and steal information via a faked/spoof domain, therefore the use of a 
  "Verified" badge instills more confidence and trust between developers and the open-
  source community.

    Step 1:
      • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your top-level group.
      • Select Settings > Domain Verification.
      • In the upper-right corner, select Add Domain.
      • In Domain, enter the domain name.
      • In Project, link to a project.
      • In Certificate:
        • If you do not have or do not want to use an SSL certificate, leave Automatic certificate management using Let's Encrypt selected.
        • Optional. Turn on the Manually enter certificate information toggle to add an SSL/TLS certificate. You can also add the certificate and key later.
      • Select Add Domain.
    Step 2:
      • After you create a new domain, the verification code prompts you. Copy the values from GitLab and paste them in your domain's control panel as a TXT record.
    Step 3:
      After you have added all the DNS records:
      • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group.
      • Select Settings > Domain Verification.
      • On the domain table row, Select Retry verification ().
