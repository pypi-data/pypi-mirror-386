title: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for contributors of new code
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: contribution_access
description: >-
  Require collaborators from outside the organization to use Multi-Factor Authentication 
  (MFA) in addition to a standard user name and password when authenticating to the 
  source code management platform.
rationale: >-
  By default every user authenticates within the system by password only. If the password 
  of a user is compromised, however, the user account and every repository to which they 
  have access are in danger of data loss, malicious code commits, and data theft. It is 
  therefore recommended that each user has Multi-Factor Authentication enabled. This 
  adds an additional layer of protection to ensure the account remains secure even if the 
  user's password is compromised.
impact: >-
  A member without enabled Multi-Factor Authentication cannot contribute to the project. 
  They must enable Multi-Factor Authentication a before they can contribute any code.
audit: |
  For your top-level group, verify that Multi-Factor Authentication is enforced for contributors and is the only way to authenticate, by doing the following:
    • On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select Admin Area.
    • Select Settings > General.
    • Expand Sign-in restrictions:
    • Check if Enforce two-factor authentication is enabled. If so, you are compliant.
remediation: |
  For your top-level group, enforce that Multi-Factor Authentication is enforced for contributors and is the only way to authenticate, by doing the following:
    • On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select Admin Area.
    • Select Settings > General.
    • Expand Sign-in restrictions:
    • Select Enforce two-factor authentication to enable this feature.

    description: >-
      Require all externally-exposed enterprise or third-party applications to enforce 
      MFA, where supported. Enforcing MFA through a directory service or SSO 
      provider is a satisfactory implementation of this Safeguard.
