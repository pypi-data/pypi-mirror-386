description: >-
  Track inactive user accounts and periodically remove them.
rationale: >-
  User accounts that have been inactive for a long period of time are enlarging the 
  surface of attack. Inactive users with high-level privileges are of particular concern, as 
  these accounts are more likely to be targets for attackers. This could potentially allow 
  access to large portions of an organization should such an attack prove successful. It is 
  recommended to remove them as soon as possible in order to prevent this.
