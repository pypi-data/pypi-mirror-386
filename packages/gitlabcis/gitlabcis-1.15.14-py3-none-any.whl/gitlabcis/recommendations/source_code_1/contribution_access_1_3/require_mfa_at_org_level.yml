title: Ensure the organization is requiring members to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: contribution_access
description: >-
  Require members of the organization to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in 
  addition to a standard user name and password when authenticating to the source code 
  management platform.
rationale: >-
  By default every user authenticates within the system by password only. If the password 
  of a user is compromised, however, the user account and every repository to which they 
  have access are in danger of data loss, malicious code commits, and data theft. It is 
  therefore recommended that each user has Multi-Factor Authentication enabled. This 
  adds an additional layer of protection to ensure the account remains secure even if the 
  user's password is compromised.
impact: >-
  Members will be removed from the organization if they don't have Multi-Factor 
  Authentication already enabled. If this is the case, it is recommended that an invitation 
  be sent to reinstate the user's access and former privileges. They must enable Multi-
  Factor Authentication to accept the invitation.

  For every organization that exists in your GitLab platform, verify that Two-Factor Authentication is enforced and is the only way to authenticate. Administrators can enforce 2FA for all users in two different ways:
  • Enforce on next sign in.
  • Suggest on next sign in, but allow a grace period before enforcing.

  Use the UI:
    1. On the left sidebar, select Search or go to.
    2. Select Admin Area.
    3. On the left sidebar, select Settings > General.
    4. Expand the Sign-in restrictions section:
    5. Verify that Enforce two-factor authentication is enabled.

    description: >-
      Require all externally-exposed enterprise or third-party applications to enforce 
      MFA, where supported. Enforcing MFA through a directory service or SSO 
      provider is a satisfactory implementation of this Safeguard.
