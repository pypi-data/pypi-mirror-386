title: Ensure inactive repositories are reviewed and archived periodically
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: repository_management
description: >-
  Track inactive repositories and remove them periodically.
rationale: >-
  Inactive repositories (i.e., no new changes introduced for a long period of time) can 
  enlarge the surface of a potential attack or data leak. These repositories are more likely 
  to be improperly managed, and thus could possibly be accessed by a large number of 
  users in an organization.
impact: >-
  Bug fixes and deployment of necessary changes could prove complicated for archived repositories.
audit: |
  Perform the following to ensure that all the projects in the organization are active. For each group:
    • Navigate to the group homepage.
    • Expand any sub-groups.
    • For each project, review the updated date and ensure it has been updated within the last 6 months.
remediation: |
  Perform the following to remediate the presence of inactive projects. For each inactive project identified during the audit:

    • Select 'Archive project'.
