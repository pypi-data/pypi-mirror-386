title: Ensure repository deletion is limited to specific users
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: repository_management
description: >-
  Ensure only a limited number of trusted users can delete repositories.
rationale: >-
  Restricting the ability to delete repositories protects the organization from intentional 
  and unintentional data loss. This ensures that users cannot delete repositories or cause 
  other potential damage — whether by accident or due to their account being hacked — 
  unless they have the correct privileges.
impact: >-
  Certain users will not be permitted to delete repositories.
audit: |
  Verify that only a limited number of trusted users can delete repositories by performing either of the following steps:
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • Select Manage > Members.
    • At the top of the member list, from the dropdown list, select Max role the members have in the group and descending order.
    • If there are minimum number of members with Owner/Maintainer role in the list, you are compliant.
remediation: |
  Enforce repository deletion by a few trusted and responsible users only by performing either of the following steps:
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • Select Manage > Members.
    • At the top of the member list, from the dropdown list, select Max role the members have in the group and descending order.
    • Next to the project member you want to remove, select Remove member.
default_value: Only organization owners or members with admin privileges can delete repositories.
