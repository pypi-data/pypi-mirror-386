title: Ensure any change to code can be traced back to its associated task
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: code_changes
description: >-
  Use a task management system to trace any code back to its associated task.
rationale: >-
  The ability to trace each piece of code back to its associated task simplifies the Agile 
  and DevOps process by enabling transparency of any code changes. This allows faster 
  remediation of bugs and security issues, while also making it harder to push 
  unauthorized code changes to sensitive projects. Additionally, using a task 
  management system simplifies achieving compliance, as it is easier to track each 
  regulation.

audit: >-
  Ensure every code change can be traced back to its origin task in a task management 
  system.
remediation: >-
  Use GitLab issues to manage tasks as the starting point for each code change. Whether 
  it is a new feature, bug fix, or security fix - all should originate from a dedicated task 
  (GitLab issue) in your organization's task management system. Tasks (issues) should 
  be linked to Merge Requests, and Merge requests should be linked to Issues.
