title: Ensure there are restrictions on who can dismiss code change reviews
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: code_changes
description: >-
  Only trusted users should be allowed to dismiss code change reviews.
rationale: >-
  Dismissing a code change review permits users to merge new suggested code changes 
  without going through the standard process of approvals. Controlling who can perform 
  this action will prevent malicious actors from simply dismissing the required reviews to 
  code changes and merging malicious or dysfunctional code into the code base.
impact: >-
  In cases where a code change proposal has been updated since it was last reviewed 
  and the person who reviewed it isn't available for approval, a general collaborator would 
  not be able to merge their code changes until a user with "dismiss review" abilities could 
  dismiss the open review. 
  Users who are not allowed to dismiss code change reviews will not be permitted to do 
  so, and thus are unable to waive the standard flow of approvals.
audit: |
  For each code repository in use, perform the next steps to verify that only trusted users are allowed to dismiss code change reviews:
  To verify that restrictions are in place around who can dismiss code change reviews, view your branch protection settings for a project.
  You must have at least the Maintainer role.
    1. On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    2. Select Settings > Repository.
    3. Expand Protected branches.
remediation: |
  Prerequisites:

    You must have at least the Maintainer role. When granting a group Allowed to merge or Allowed to push and merge permissions on a protected branch, the group must be added to the project. To protect a branch:
      1. On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
      2. Select Settings > Repository.
      3. Expand Protected branches.
      4. Select Add protected branch.
      5. From the Branch dropdown list, select the branch you want to protect.
      6. From the Allowed to merge list, select a role that can merge into this branch.
      7. From the Allowed to push and merge list, select a role that can push to this branch.
  
  In GitLab Premium and Ultimate, you can also add groups or individual users to Allowed to merge and Allowed to push and merge. Select Protect. The protected branch displays in the list of protected branches.
default_value: By default, all users who have write access to the code repository are able to dismiss code change reviews.

    description: >-
