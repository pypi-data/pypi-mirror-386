title: Ensure verification of signed commits for new changes before merging
profile: 2
category: source_code
sub_category: code_changes
description: >-
  Ensure every commit in a merge request is signed and verified before merging.
rationale: >-
  Signing commits, or requiring to sign commits, gives other users confidence about the 
  origin of a specific code change. It ensures that the author of the change is not hidden 
  and is verified by the version control system, thus the change comes from a trusted 
  source.
impact: >-
  Merge requests with unsigned commits cannot be merged.
audit: |
  Identify which projects permit unsigned commits by performing the following steps for each project:
    • Navigate to the main page of the project.
    • In the sidebar, select Settings > Repository.
    • Expand the Push rules section.
    • Identify the Select push rules section.
    • If 'Reject unsigned commits' is selected the project is compliant.
remediation: |
  Ensure only signed commits can be merged for every branch via branch protection rules by performing the following steps for each project:
    • Navigate to the main page of the project.
    • In the sidebar, select Settings > Repository.
    • Expand the Push rules section.
    • Under Select push rules select 'Reject unsigned commits'.
    • Select 'Save push rules'.
  
  As an administrator you can configure a secure default for new projects by performing the following steps:
    • Navigate to the Admin Area.
    • In the sidebar, select Push Rules.
    • Select 'Reject unsigned commits'.
    • Select 'Save push rules'.
