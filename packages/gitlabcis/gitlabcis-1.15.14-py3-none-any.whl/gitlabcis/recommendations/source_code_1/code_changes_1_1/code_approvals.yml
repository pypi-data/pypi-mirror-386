title: Ensure any change to code receives approval of two strongly authenticated users
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: code_changes
description: >-
  Ensure that every code change is reviewed and approved by two authorized 
  contributors who are both strongly authenticated - using Multi-Factor Authentication 
  (MFA), from the team relevant to the code change.
rationale: >-
  To prevent malicious or unauthorized code changes, the first layer of protection is the 
  process of code review. This process involves engineer teammates reviewing each 
  other's code for errors, optimizations, and general knowledge-sharing. With proper peer 
  reviews in place, an organization can detect unwanted code changes very early in the 
  process of release. In order to help facilitate code review, companies should employ 
  automation to verify that every code change has been reviewed and approved by at 
  least two team members before it is pushed into the code base. These team members 
  should be from the team that is related to the code change, so it will be a meaningful 
  review.
impact: >-
  To enforce a code review requirement, verification for a minimum of two reviewers must
  be put into place. This will ensure new code will not be able to be pushed to the code
  base before it has received two independent approvals.

  For every project in use, perform the next steps to verify that two approvals from the specific project team are required to push new code to the code base:
    • On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    • Select Settings > Merge requests.
    • In the Merge request approvals section, in the Approval rules section, next to the rule you want to edit, select Edit.
    • Review the field In Approvals required, if the number is 2 or above, you are compliant.
