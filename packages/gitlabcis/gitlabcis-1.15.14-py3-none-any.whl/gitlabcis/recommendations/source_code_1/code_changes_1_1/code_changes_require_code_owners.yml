title: Ensure code owner's review is required when a change affects owned code
profile: 1
category: source_code
sub_category: code_changes
description: >-
  Ensure trusted code owners are required to review and approve any code change 
  proposal made to their respective owned areas in the code base.
rationale: >-
  Configuring code owners ensures that no code, especially code which could prove 
  malicious, will slip into the source code or configuration files of a repository. This allows 
  an organization to mark areas in the code base that are especially sensitive or more 
  prone to an attack. It can also enforce review by specific individuals who are designated 
  as owners to those areas so that they may filter out unauthorized or unwanted changes 
  beforehand.
impact: >-
  If an organization enforces code owner-based reviews, some code change proposals 
  would not be able to be merged to the codebase before specific, trusted individuals 
  approve them.
audit: |
  With merge request approval rules, you can set the minimum number of required approvals by code owners before work can merge into your project.
    1. On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    2. Select Settings > Repository.
    3. Expand Protected branches.
    4. Next to the default branch, turn on the toggle under Code owner approval.

  Prerequisites:
    • You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.
    • To add a group as an approver in GitLab.com, you must be a member of the group or the group must be public.
  To add a merge request approval rule:
    1. On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
    2. Select Settings > Merge requests.
    3. In the Merge request approvals section, in the Approval rules section, select Add approval rule.
    4. Complete the fields:
      • In Approvals required, a value of 0 makes the rule optional, and any number greater than 0 creates a required rule. Maximum number of required approvals is 100.
      • From Add approvers, select users or groups that are eligible to approve. GitLab suggests approvers based on previous authors of the files changed by the merge request.
    5. Select Add approval rule. You can add multiple approval rules.
default_value: Code owners are not required to review changes by default.
