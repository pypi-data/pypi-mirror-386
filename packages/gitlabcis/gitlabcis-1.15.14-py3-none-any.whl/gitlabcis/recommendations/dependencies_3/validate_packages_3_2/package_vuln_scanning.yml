title: Ensure packages are automatically scanned for known vulnerabilities
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: validate_packages
description: >-
  Automatically scan every package for vulnerabilities.
rationale: >-
  Automatic scanning for vulnerabilities detects known vulnerabilities in packages and 
  dependencies in use, allowing faster patching when one is found. Such vulnerabilities 
  can lead to a massive breach if not handled as fast as possible, as attackers will also 
  know about those vulnerabilities and swiftly try to take advantage of them. Scanning 
  packages regularly for vulnerabilities can also verify usage compliance with the 
  organization's security policy.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Once Dependency Scanning is enabled for your project, continuous scanning of 
  packages for dependency vulnerabilities is enabled.
remediation: |
  Enable Dependency scanning in order to automatically scan packages for vulnerabilities. To enable the analyzer, either:
    • Enable Auto DevOps, which includes dependency scanning.
    • Edit the .gitlab-ci.yml file manually. Use this method if your .gitlab-ci.yml file is complex.
    • Use a preconfigured merge request.
    • Create a scan execution policy that enforces dependency scanning.
