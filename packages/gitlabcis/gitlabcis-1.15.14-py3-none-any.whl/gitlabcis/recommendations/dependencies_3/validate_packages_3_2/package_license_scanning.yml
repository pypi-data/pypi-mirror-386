title: Ensure packages are automatically scanned for license implications
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: validate_packages
description: >-
  A software license is a document that provides legal conditions and guidelines for the 
  use and distribution of software, usually defined by the author. It is recommended to 
  scan for any legal implications automatically.
rationale: >-
  When using packages with software licenses, especially commercial ones which tend to 
  be the strictest, it is important to verify that the use of the package meets the conditions 
  of the license. If the use of the package violates the licensing agreement, it exposes the 
  organization to possible lawsuits. Scanning used packages for such license implications 
  leads to faster detection and quicker fixes of such violations, and also reduces the risk 
  for a lawsuit.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  Ensure license implication rules are configured and are scanned automatically. Once 
  Dependency Scanning is enabled for your project, continuous license scanning is 
  enabled.
remediation: |
  Enable Dependency scanning in order to automatically scan packages for license implications. To enable the analyzer, either:
    • Enable Auto DevOps, which includes dependency scanning.
    • Edit the .gitlab-ci.yml file manually. Use this method if your .gitlab-ci.yml file is complex.
    • Use a preconfigured merge request.
    • Create a scan execution policy that enforces dependency scanning.
