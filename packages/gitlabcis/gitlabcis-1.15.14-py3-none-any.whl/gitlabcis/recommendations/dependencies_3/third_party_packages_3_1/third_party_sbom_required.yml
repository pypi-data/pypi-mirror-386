title: Ensure Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is required from all third-party suppliers
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: third_party_packages
description: >-
  A Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) is a file that specifies each component of software 
  or a build process. Require an SBOM from every third-party provider.
rationale: >-
  A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for every third-party artifact helps to ensure an 
  artifact is safe to use and fully compliant. This file lists all important metadata, especially 
  all the dependencies of an artifact, and allows for verification of each dependency. If 
  one of the dependencies/artifacts are attacked or has a new vulnerability (for example, 
  the "SolarWinds" or even "log4j" attacks), it is easier to detect what has been affected 
  by this incident because dependencies in use are listed in the SBOM file.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For every third-party dependency in use, ensure it has a Software Bill of Materials.
remediation: >-
  For every third-party dependency in use, require a Software Bill of Materials from its supplier.

    name: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory
    description: >-
      Establish and maintain a detailed inventory of all licensed software installed on 
      enterprise assets. The software inventory must document the title, publisher, initial 
      install/use date, and business purpose for each entry; where appropriate, include 
      the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), app store(s), version(s), deployment 
      mechanism, and decommission date. Review and update the software inventory bi-
      annually, or more frequently.

    description: >-
      Use up-to-date and trusted third-party software components. When possible, 
      choose established and proven frameworks and libraries that provide adequate 
      security. Acquire these components from trusted sources or evaluate the software 
      for vulnerabilities before use.
