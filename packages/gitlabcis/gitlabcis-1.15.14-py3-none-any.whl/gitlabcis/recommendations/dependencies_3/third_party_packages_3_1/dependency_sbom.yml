title: Ensure a signed Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) of the code is supplied
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: third_party_packages
description: >-
  A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a file that specifies each component of software 
  or a build process. When using a dependency, demand its SBOM and ensure it is 
  signed for validation purposes.
rationale: >-
  A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) creates trust between its provider and its users by 
  ensuring that the software supplied is the software described, without any potential 
  interference in between. Signing an SBOM creates a checksum for it, which will change 
  if the SBOM's content was changed. With that checksum, a software user can be 
  certain nothing had happened to it during the supply chain, engendering trust in the 
  software. When there is no such trust in the software, the risk surface is increased 
  because one cannot know if the software is potentially vulnerable. Demanding a signed 
  SBOM and validating it decreases that risk.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For every artifact supplied, ensure it has a validated, signed Software Bill of Materials. 
  To view the SBOMs associated with your projects, Navigate to 
  Secure --> Dependency list 
  You may export the SBOM in .json format
remediation: |
  For every artifact supplied, require and verify a signed Software Bill of Materials from its supplier.
    1. To create an SBOM, you must run a dependency scan.
    2. Enable dependency scanning, and an SBOM will be automatically generated for your project.

    name: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory
    description: >-
      Establish and maintain a detailed inventory of all licensed software installed on 
      enterprise assets. The software inventory must document the title, publisher, initial 
      install/use date, and business purpose for each entry; where appropriate, include 
      the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), app store(s), version(s), deployment 
      mechanism, and decommission date. Review and update the software inventory bi-
      annually, or more frequently.

    name: Ensure Authorized Software is Currently Supported
    description: >-
      Ensure that only currently supported software is designated as authorized in the 
      software inventory for enterprise assets. If software is unsupported, yet necessary 
      for the fulfillment of the enterprise's mission, document an exception detailing 
      mitigating controls and residual risk acceptance. For any unsupported software 
      without an exception documentation, designate as unauthorized. Review the 
      software list to verify software support at least monthly, or more frequently.
