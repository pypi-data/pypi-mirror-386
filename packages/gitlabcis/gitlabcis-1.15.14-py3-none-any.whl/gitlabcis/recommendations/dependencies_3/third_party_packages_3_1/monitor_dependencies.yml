title: Ensure dependencies are monitored between open-source components
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: third_party_packages
description: >-
  Monitor, or ask software suppliers to monitor, dependencies between open-source components in use.
rationale: >-
  Monitoring dependencies between open-source components helps to detect if software 
  has fallen victim to attack on a common open-source component. Swift detection can 
  aid in quick application of a fix. It also helps find potential compliance problems with 
  components usage. Some dependencies might not be compatible with the 
  organization's policies, and other dependencies might have a license that is not 
  compatible with how the organization uses this specific dependency. If dependencies 
  are monitored, such situations can be detected and mitigated sooner, potentially 
  deterring malicious attacks.

audit: |
  For each project, ensure that dependency scanning and container scanning are enabled in order to monitor dependencies.
    1. On GitLab, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    2. Review the CI pipeline configuration to verify that Dependency Scanning and that Container Scanning have been configured to run on this project.
remediation: |
  For every repository that is in use, set a dependency scanning and container scanning tools to detect, prevent, and monitor vulnerabilities in project packages and container images by performing the following:
    1. On GitLab, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    2. Configure Dependency Scanning and Container Scanning to run on this project
