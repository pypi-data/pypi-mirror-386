title: Ensure trusted package managers and repositories are defined and prioritized
profile: 1
category: dependencies
sub_category: third_party_packages
description: >-
  Prioritize trusted package registries over others when pulling a package.
rationale: >-
  When pulling a package by name, the package manager might look for it in several 
  package registries, some of which may be untrusted or badly configured. If the package 
  is pulled from such a registry, there is a higher likelihood that it could prove malicious. In 
  order to avoid this, configure packages to be pulled from trusted package registries.
impact: >-
audit: >-
  For each package registry in use, ensure it is trusted. The GitLab package registry is 
  enabled by default.
remediation: >-
  For each package to be downloaded, configure it to be downloaded from a trusted 
  source. To view your GitLab package registry and its contents, click on "Deploy" --> 
  "Package Registry."
