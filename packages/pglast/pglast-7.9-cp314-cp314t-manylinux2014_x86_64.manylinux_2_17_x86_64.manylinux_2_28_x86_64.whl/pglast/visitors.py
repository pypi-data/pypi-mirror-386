class Ancestor:
    """Simple object to keep track of the node's ancestors while it's being visited.

    :param Ancestor parent: the parent of the new instance
    :param node: the tracked object
    :param member: either the name of the attribute or the index in the sequence
                   that points to the tracked object in the parent container

    An instance of this class represent a particular ancestor in the hierarchy chain: it
    carries a reference that points to the higher item in the chain, the associated
    :class:`.ast.Node` instance and a *member*, either the attribute name or sequential index
    in the parent node: the latter happens when the parent node is actually a tuple, not an
    ``Node`` instance.

    Accessing an instance with a positive index returns the nth node up in the hierarchy.

    When applied (using the ``@`` operator) to an :class:`.ast.Node` instance will traverse
    that node returning the leaf one corresponding to the whole chain.

    Example:

    .. testsetup:: *

        from pglast import parse_sql
        from pglast.visitors import Ancestor

    .. doctest::

        >>> tree = parse_sql('select 1')
        >>> root = Ancestor()
        >>> root
        ROOT
        >>> root@tree is tree
        True
        >>> root[0] is None
        True
        >>> select_stmt_path = root / (tree, 0) / (tree[0], 'stmt')
        >>> select_stmt_path
        ROOT → 0 → stmt
        >>> select_stmt_path@tree is tree[0].stmt
        True
        >>> select_stmt_path[0] is tree[0]
        True
        >>> columns_path = (select_stmt_path
        ...                 / (tree[0].stmt, 'targetList'))
        >>> first_col_path = (columns_path
        ...                   / (tree[0].stmt.targetList[0], 0))
        >>> first_col_path
        ROOT → 0 → stmt → targetList → 0
        >>> first_col_path[0]
        <ResTarget val=<A_Const isnull=False val=<Integer ival=1>>>
        >>> first_col_path[1] is columns_path[0]
        True

    As said, the `node` is not always a :class:`.ast.Node`, but may be a tuple, possibly
    containing *subtuples*, for example the ``functions`` slot of :class:`~.ast.RangeFunction`
    that is a tuple of tuples, each containing a :class:`~.ast.FuncCall` and possibly other
    values:

    .. testsetup:: *

        from pglast.visitors import Visitor

    .. doctest::

        >>> tree = parse_sql('SELECT * FROM ROWS'
        ...                  ' FROM (generate_series(10,11),'
        ...                  '       get_users())')
        >>> class VerboseVisitor(Visitor):
        ...   all_ancestors = []
        ...   def visit(self, ancestors, node):
        ...     print(f'{len(self.all_ancestors):2d}.',
        ...           "node:", type(node).__name__,
        ...           "ancestor:", type(ancestors.node).__name__)
        ...     self.all_ancestors.append(ancestors)
        >>> VerboseVisitor()(tree)
         0. node: RawStmt ancestor: tuple
         1. node: SelectStmt ancestor: RawStmt
         2. node: ResTarget ancestor: tuple
         3. node: RangeFunction ancestor: tuple
         4. node: ColumnRef ancestor: ResTarget
         5. node: A_Star ancestor: tuple
         6. node: FuncCall ancestor: tuple
         7. node: FuncCall ancestor: tuple
         8. node: String ancestor: tuple
         9. node: A_Const ancestor: tuple
        10. node: A_Const ancestor: tuple
        11. node: String ancestor: tuple
        12. node: Integer ancestor: A_Const
        13. node: Integer ancestor: A_Const
        ...

    To find the closest ancestor that is actually pointing to an AST node you may use the
    ``abs()`` function:

    .. doctest::

        >>> range_function = tree[0].stmt.fromClause[0]
        >>> gen_series_funccall = range_function.functions[0][0]
        >>> gen_series_funccall
        <FuncCall funcname=(<String sval='generate_series'>,) ...>
        >>> generate_series_ancestry = VerboseVisitor.all_ancestors[6]
        >>> generate_series_ancestry@tree is gen_series_funccall
        True
        >>> abs(generate_series_ancestry).node is range_function
        True

    As an aid to visitors that apply changes to the AST, there are two methods, :meth:`update`
    and :meth:`apply`, that takes care of the different cases, when `node` is an AST instance
    or instead it's a tuple (or subtuple); the former does not directly change the AST tree,
    but postpones that when the latter is called.

    To use it, you shall write a subclass that implements a set of particular named methods,
    specifically ``visit_XYZ`` where ``XYZ`` is the name of a class name defined in the
    :mod:`pglast.ast` module.

    Instances of this class are *callables* and accept either a :class:`.ast.Node`
    instance or a sequence of instances, typically the result of :func:`parse_sql
    <pglast.parser.parse_sql>`. The argument will be *traversed* in a `breadth first`__ order
    and each :class:`Node <.ast.Node>` instance will be passed to the corresponding
    ``visit_XYZ`` method if it is implemented, falling back to the default ``visit`` method. If
    none of them are defined, the node will be ignored.

    The ``visit_XYZ`` methods receive two arguments: the *ancestry chain* of the node, an
    instance of :class:`Ancestor` and the :class:`Node <.ast.Node>` instance itself. The
    methods may return either ``None``, an *action* or a new node that will replace the
