# Specification Quality Checklist: CLI & Core Agent Engine (v0.1)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [001-cli-core-engine/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Specification Quality Summary

âœ… **PASSED** - All checklist items complete. Specification is ready for planning phase.

### Validation Details

**Content Quality**: The specification avoids implementation details (no specific Python frameworks, database engines, or API libraries mentioned). All requirements are business-focused and center on user workflows (developers initializing projects, defining agents through YAML, testing, and deploying).

**Requirement Completeness**: 30 functional requirements are clearly defined and testable. No unclear areas remain - all requirements can be verified through concrete acceptance criteria. 7 user stories with priorities (5 P1, 2 P2) provide clear prioritization for implementation phases. 10 measurable success criteria focus on user outcomes and system behavior.

**Feature Readiness**: Each user story is independently testable (can implement Story 1 alone and still deliver value). Requirements map directly to acceptance scenarios that can be automated or manually verified. Success criteria avoid implementation details - they measure user-facing outcomes like "response time under 3 seconds" rather than "API latency under 200ms".

### Key Strengths

1. **Clear MVP Definition**: P1 stories provide foundational value; P2 stories enhance workflow but aren't blocking
2. **Technology-Agnostic Success Criteria**: Metrics like "tool tracking works with 100% accuracy" and "response time under 3 seconds" focus on user experience, not implementation
3. **Comprehensive Tool Coverage**: All tool types mentioned in VISION.md (vectorstore, function, MCP) are included with clear requirements
4. **Error Handling**: Requirements explicitly address validation, missing files, API failures, and evaluation failures
5. **Scope Clarity**: Out of Scope section clearly delineates what's for v0.2+, reducing implementation ambiguity

### Areas Ready for Planning

- CLI command structure is well-defined and can be spec'd in detail
- Agent YAML schema can be formally defined based on FR-004 through FR-007
- Tool execution pipeline requirements are clear (FR-008 through FR-012)
- Test/evaluation flow is unambiguous (FR-013 through FR-018)
- API endpoint contract is defined (FR-024, FR-025)

## Next Steps

Specification approved for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` workflow. No clarifications needed.
