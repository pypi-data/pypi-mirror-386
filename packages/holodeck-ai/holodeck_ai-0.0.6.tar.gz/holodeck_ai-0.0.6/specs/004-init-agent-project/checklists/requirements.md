# Specification Quality Checklist: Initialize New Agent Project

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [004-init-agent-project/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **PASSED - Specification is ready for planning phase**

### Validation Summary

All checklist items have been verified as complete:

1. **Content Quality**: Spec avoids implementation details, focuses on user value, and uses business/user language. No technical stack specifications or framework-specific discussions.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 22 functional requirements are clearly stated and testable. No clarification markers needed - requirements are specific and unambiguous. All 5 user stories are P1 or P2 with clear priorities.

3. **Success Criteria**: 7 measurable outcomes defined that are technology-agnostic and verifiable without knowing implementation. Example: "under 30 seconds", "0 schema validation errors", "80% of users", "without additional setup".

4. **Feature Readiness**: All functional requirements have acceptance scenarios. Five user stories define primary flows covering basic project creation (US1), template selection (US2), example generation (US3), validation (US4), and metadata (US5). Edge cases cover 6 common failure scenarios.

### Quality Assessment

- **Completeness**: 100% - All mandatory sections filled with substantive content
- **Testability**: 100% - Every acceptance scenario is independently verifiable
- **Clarity**: 100% - Requirements use specific, measurable language
- **Scope**: Well-bounded - 9 clear assumptions and 6 out-of-scope items define boundaries

## Notes

- Specification directly references parent spec (001-cli-core-engine) for context alignment
- All user stories are independently deployable - each provides value in isolation
- Success criteria emphasize developer experience metrics (speed, error rate, learning curve)
- Templates (conversational, research, customer-support) align with use cases mentioned in parent spec
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers required - reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section
