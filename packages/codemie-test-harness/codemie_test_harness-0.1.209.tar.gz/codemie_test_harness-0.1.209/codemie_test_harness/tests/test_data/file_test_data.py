            Context

            Scenario:
            Travelers planning international trips often need to compare accommodation prices in their local currency to better understand overall costs. Currently, the search functionality in the travel booking system allows filtering only by destination, travel dates, and the number of passengers. However, it does not provide an option to view prices in different currencies. This limitation can lead to confusion and make budgeting difficult, as travelers must manually convert prices using external tools.

            Challenges:
            •	Inability to filter prices by currency:
            Users cannot view accommodation prices in their preferred or local currency. This gap results in confusion and increases the potential for errors in cost estimation.
            •	Manual Currency Conversions:
            Without built-in currency conversion, users must rely on external tools or websites. These extra steps waste time and increase the risk of conversion mistakes.

            Requirements for User Story Generation:
            Add an advanced filtering option that allows users to view and compare accommodation prices in the following currencies:
            •	US Dollar
            •	Euro
            •	Japanese Yen
            •	British Pound Sterling
            •	Swiss Franc
            •	Canadian Dollar
            •	Australian Dollar
            •	Chinese Yuan Renminbi
            The system should display costs in the chosen currency, along with the currency code and numeric identifier, to help travelers more accurately budget and decide on accommodations. For example, AUD 36 Australian dollar.

            #### What is Software Testing?
            Software testing is defined as the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application operates as expected.

            #### Types of Software Testing
            - **Unit Testing**
            - **Integration Testing**
            - **System Testing**
            - **Acceptance Testing**

            #### Example Test Case
            - **Test Case:** Verify Login Functionality
                - **Steps:**
                    1. Open the login page.
                    2. Enter valid credentials.
                    3. Click login.
                    4. Verify successful login.

            #### Conclusion
            The document concludes by emphasizing that software testing is crucial for ensuring applications work as intended, thereby reducing bugs and enhancing quality.pptx
