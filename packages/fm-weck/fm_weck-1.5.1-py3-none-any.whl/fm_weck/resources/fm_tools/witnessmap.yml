description: |
  WitnessMap is a simple tool with the same input and output as a verifier that
  only copies witnesses contained in validation tasks
  to its output folder.
  It is used by SV-COMP to place existing verification witnesses
  at the location where the competition infrastructure expects them
  (this way, the witness is technically 'produced' by a tool
  with the same interface as a verifier).
