# Multi-Agent Task Execution System

This repository implements a multi-agent system that decomposes complex tasks into discrete steps, routing them to specialized agents for execution. The system comprises three main components:

1. **Planner Agent**: Orchestrates the workflow by planning task execution and routing subtasks to worker agents.
2. **Researcher Agent**: Gathers information, formulas, and reference materials without performing calculations.
3. **Coder Agent**: Executes calculations and evaluates formulas with specific values.

Each agent operates independently and can be deployed as a separate process, while still being packaged together as part of an Orchestrator Agent Package.

## System Architecture

The system utilizes LangGraph to create a directed graph of agents that can communicate and share state.

## Agent Responsibilities

- **Planner Agent**:
  - Takes user questions and formulates execution plans.
  - Routes tasks to appropriate worker agents.
  - Manages execution flow and state tracking.
  - Returns final results to the user.

- **Researcher Agent**:
  - Retrieves information using a Tavily search tool.
  - Provides factual content, definitions, and formulas.
  - Does not perform calculations (strictly enforced).

- **Coder Agent**:
  - Executes calculations using Python code.
  - Evaluates formulas with specific input values.
  - Returns precise numerical results.

## Usage

### Running the System

To run the entire system, use the following command with the complete JSON input:

```bash
uipath run planner '{"question": "First, please state the Pythagorean theorem. Give only the formula, using variables a, b, and c. Then apply this formula to calculate the value when a=2 and b=3."}'
```

### Debugging Individual Agents

You can debug individual agents by invoking them directly:

#### Researcher Agent
Run the researcher agent with:

```bash
uipath run researcher '{"messages":[{"content":"State the Pythagorean theorem formula using variables a, b, and c","type":"human"}]}'
```

#### Coder Agent
Run the coder agent with:

```bash
uipath run coder '{"messages":[{"content":"Let me help you state the Pythagorean theorem formula. The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental mathematical formula that describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle.\n\nThe formula is:\n\naÂ² + bÂ² = cÂ²\n\nWhere:\n- a and b are the lengths of the two legs (the sides adjacent to the right angle)\n- c is the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite to the right angle).","type":"human","name":"researcher-agent"},{"content":"Calculate the result using the formula when a=2 and b=3","type":"human"}]}'
```

## Sample Workflow

1. User submits a question about the Pythagorean theorem.
2. Planner creates an execution plan with two steps:
   - Step 1: Researcher agent retrieves the Pythagorean theorem formula.
   - Step 2: Coder agent applies the formula to calculate the result for a=2, b=3.
3. Planner executes Step 1 by invoking the researcher agent.
4. Researcher agent returns the formula aÂ² + bÂ² = cÂ².
5. Planner executes Step 2 by invoking the coder agent.
6. Coder agent calculates c = âˆš(2Â² + 3Â²) = âˆš(4 + 9) = âˆš13 â‰ˆ 3.606.
7. Planner combines the responses and returns the final answer to the user.

   > **Note:** Ensure that the display names for the coder and researcher agent processes are *coder-agent* and *researcher-agent*,
        and that all 3 agents are placed in the same folder.

7. **Run the Planner Agent with Any Input Question**
   > **Tip:** For a five-step action plan, consider using the following input:
   ```
   Could you find a Python solution for the N-Queens puzzle for N=8? Please analyze why this solution works,
   considering the key programming concepts it employs.
   Then, revise the solution to handle a dynamic value of N, where N is any positive integer.
   After that, research the time and space complexity of this new solution.
   Lastly, demonstrate this revised Python solution with N=10.
   ```
