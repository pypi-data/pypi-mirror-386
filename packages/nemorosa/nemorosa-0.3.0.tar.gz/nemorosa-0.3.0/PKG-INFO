`nemorosa` is a specialized cross-seeding tool designed specifically for music torrents, designed to work alongside [cross-seed](https://github.com/cross-seed/cross-seed).

Compared to existing music torrent cross-seeding tools, `nemorosa` offers the strongest matching capabilities and the widest range of supported trackers, and the most natural and human-friendly user experience.

Unlike traditional music torrent cross-seeding tools that can only match torrents with identical hashes, `nemorosa` excels at partial matching and automatic file mapping, enabling cross-seeding from **any source site** to Gazelle-based trackers.

## Features

- **Natural User Experience**: Automatically reads torrents from your client, finds cross-seeding opportunities, and seamlessly injects matched torrents
- **Advanced Partial Matching**: Handles cases like different block sizes, missing artwork, or modified covers that would fail with traditional tools
- **Automatic File Mapping**: Automatically renames folders and files to match your existing content, including handling zero-width spaces and other encoding issues seamlessly, entirely through torrent client's built-in renaming functionality without hard/soft links, so you don't need to worry about linking problems.
- **Wide Site Support**: Supports cross-seeding from **any source site** (including non-Gazelle trackers, public trackers, or any other torrent source) to Gazelle-based target trackers:
  - **GazelleJSONAPI**: RED/OPS/DIC (modern Gazelle with API support)
  - **Gazelle (Legacy)**: LZTR/Libble (legacy Gazelle with parser support)
- **Web Server Mode**: HTTP API and webhook support for integration with other tools and automation
  - **Scheduled Jobs**: Automated search and cleanup tasks with configurable intervals
  - **Announce Matching**: Automatically matches cross-seeds from IRC announces or RSS feeds by processing torrent announces from autobrr.
  - **Triggering Searches**: Enables immediate cross-seed searches when torrents finish downloading by adding on-completion scripts to your torrent client that call `nemorosa`'s HTTP API.
- **Smart Retry System**: Automatically retry failed downloads and track undownloaded torrents
- **Multi-Client Support**: Works with Transmission, qBittorrent, Deluge, and rTorrent

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- One of the supported torrent clients with remote access enabled:
  - **Transmission**
  - **qBittorrent**
  - **Deluge**
  - **rTorrent**

  **Note**: If using qBittorrent < 4.5.0, Transmission, Deluge, or rTorrent, `nemorosa` needs access to the client's torrents directory. When running in Docker, ensure you map the torrents directory to the `nemorosa` container.
- Access to Gazelle-based target trackers for cross-seeding (**source sites can be ANY type**):
  - **GazelleJSONAPI**: RED, OPS, DIC
  - **Gazelle (Legacy)**: LZTR, Libble
- Valid API key or cookie for target tracker authentication
