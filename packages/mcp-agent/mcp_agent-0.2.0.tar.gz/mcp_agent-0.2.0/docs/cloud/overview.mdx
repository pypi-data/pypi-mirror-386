description: "[In beta] Deploy and manage AI agents as MCP servers"
---

## Overview

**mcp-agent cloud** deploys your agents as MCP servers, where agent workflows become long-running MCP tools executed in a durable workflow orchestration engine (Temporal). This architecture enables:

- **Agents as MCP Servers**: Your agents are exposed as standard MCP servers that any MCP client can connect to
- **Workflows as Durable Tools**: Agent workflows are exposed as MCP tools that run durably via Temporal
- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Built-in retry logic, fault tolerance, and state persistence

## Key Features

- **Agent Deployment**: Deploy agents as MCP servers accessible via HTTP/WebSocket
- **Temporal Integration**: Durable workflow execution with automatic retries
- **Secrets Management**: Secure storage and injection of API keys
- **Monitoring**: Real-time logs, metrics, and workflow tracking

## Preparing your mcp-agent app as a server

1. Double check that your entrypoint python file is named `main.py`

<Note>When packaging your mcp-agent app for the cloud, our CLI will be searching for `main.py`. The entire directory will be deployed, so you can reference other files and upload other assets.</Note>

<Note>You can optionally exclude files from the bundle using an ignore file (gitignore syntax). Precedence: 1) `--ignore-file <path>` (explicit override), 2) `.mcpacignore` in `--config-dir`, 3) `.mcpacignore` in the working directory (CWD).</Note>

2. Make sure you have either a `pyproject.toml` or a `requirements.txt` file in your app directory.

3. Mark your functions that you'd like to be tool calls with the `@app.tool` decorators

```python main.py
# Your agent definition
@app.tool
async def research(query) -> str:
  # this is where your agent logic exists (functions and calls)
  return results

# Becomes an MCP tool when deployed:
# Tool: "research"
```

## Deploying your mcp-agent app

1. Login into mcp-agent cloud to get your `api key`

```bash
uv run mcp-agent login
```

2. Deploy your app

```bash
uv run mcp-agent deploy my-first-agent
```

<Note>During the deployment flow, you will be guided through how you'd like your secrets to be managed.</Note>

## Connect to your deployed mcp-agent server

### Claude Desktop integration

Configure Claude Desktop to access your agent server

```json .claude-desktop/config.json
"my-agent-server": {
  "command": "/path/to/npx",
  "args": [
    "mcp-remote",
    "https://[your-agent-server-id].deployments.mcp-agent.com/sse",
    "--header",
    "Authorization: Bearer ${BEARER_TOKEN}"
  ],
  "env": {
        "BEARER_TOKEN": "your-mcp-agent-cloud-api-token"
      }
}
```

### MCP Inspector

Run your local MCP Inspector
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector 
```

Connect with the following settings
| Setting | Value | 
|---|---|
| *Transport Type* | *SSE* |
| *SSE* | *https://[your-agent-server-id].deployments.mcp-agent.com/sse* |
| *Header Name* | *Authorization* | 
| *Bearer Token* | *your-mcp-agent-cloud-api-token* |
