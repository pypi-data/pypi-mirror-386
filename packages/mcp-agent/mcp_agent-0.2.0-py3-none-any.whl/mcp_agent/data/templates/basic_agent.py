"""
Welcome to mcp-agent! We believe MCP is all you need to build and deploy agents.
This is a canonical getting-started example that covers everything you need to know to get started.

We will cover:
  - Hello world agent: Setting up a basic Agent that uses the fetch and filesystem MCP servers to do cool stuff.
  - @app.tool and @app.async_tool decorators to expose your agents as long-running tools on an MCP server.
  - Advanced MCP features: Notifications, sampling, and elicitation

You can run this example locally using "uv run main.py", and also deploy it as an MCP server using "mcp-agent deploy".

Let's get started!
