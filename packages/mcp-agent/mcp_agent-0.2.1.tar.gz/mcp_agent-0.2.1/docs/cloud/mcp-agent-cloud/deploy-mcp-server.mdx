title: "Deploying MCP Servers"
description: "Ship FastMCP or custom MCP servers on mcp-agent cloud infrastructure"
---

`mcp-agent cloud` is not limited to full agent workflows—you can deploy any MCP-compliant server (Python, Node, Rust, etc.) and let the platform handle hosting, auth, and observability. This is ideal for tool libraries, data access APIs, or bridge services that you want to publish without maintaining infrastructure.

## Why deploy plain MCP servers?

- **Standard MCP interface** – Serve tools, resources, and prompts that any MCP client can consume.
- **Managed runtime** – Containers, TLS, load balancing, and scaling handled automatically.
- **Security** – Secrets vault, per-client API keys, optional unauthenticated mode for public registries.
- **Observability** – Consistent logging + OTEL pipeline and CLI integration (`mcp-agent cloud logger tail`).
- **Upgrade path** – When you are ready for long-running workflows, migrate the project to `MCPApp` without changing deployment tooling.

### Side-by-side capabilities

| Capability | Managed MCP server | Full mcp-agent app |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tools & resources | ✅ Standard MCP tools/resources | ✅ Same, plus workflow-generated tools |
| Long-running work | ⚠️ Request lifetime only | ✅ Temporal workflows with pause/resume |
| Human input | Manual implementation | ✅ Built-in `request_human_input` APIs |
| Retry & durability | Manual retries/logging | ✅ Automatic retries, state persistence |
| Observability | ✅ Logs + OTEL forwarding | ✅ All of the left, plus workflow history |
| Client integration | ✅ SSE/HTTP endpoints | ✅ Same endpoints |

## FastMCP example

```python
# main.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("utilities")

@mcp.tool()
async def hash_text(text: str, algorithm: str = "sha256") -> str:
    """Generate a hash of text using hashlib."""
    import hashlib
    h = hashlib.new(algorithm)
    h.update(text.encode())
    return h.hexdigest()

@mcp.resource("utils://algorithms")
async def list_algorithms():
    return {"algorithms": ["md5", "sha1", "sha256", "sha3_512"]}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

Configuration (`mcp_agent.config.yaml`) only needs to reference the entrypoint:

```yaml
name: utilities-server
description: "Handy utility tools exposed over MCP"

execution_engine: asyncio           # No workflows required

mcp:
  servers:
    utilities:
      command: "uvx"
      args: ["python", "main.py"]

logger:
  transports: [console]
  level: info
```

`mcp_agent.secrets.yaml` remains optional unless your server calls external APIs.

## MCPApp-only example (no workflows)

If you prefer to stay inside the `mcp-agent` API surface (to reuse `context`, logging, etc.) you can create tools with decorators and skip workflow definitions.

```python
from mcp_agent.app import MCPApp

app = MCPApp(name="markdown_tools")

@app.tool
async def to_title_case(text: str) -> str:
    return text.title()

@app.tool
async def count_words(text: str) -> int:
    return len(text.split())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(app.run())
```

Config:

```yaml
name: markdown-tools
execution_engine: asyncio
logger:
  transports: [console]
  level: info
```

Because there are no workflows, the app behaves like a standard MCP server but you can add Temporal-backed workflows later without changing the deployment process.

## Deploy the server

1. **Authenticate** (once per environment):

   ```bash
   mcp-agent login          # stores MCP_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Deploy from the directory that contains `main.py` and `mcp_agent.config.yaml`:**

   ```bash
   mcp-agent deploy utilities-server \
     --app-description "Utility functions as MCP tools"
   ```

   - Use `--config-dir path/to/server` if deploying from a monorepo.
   - Add `--no-auth` to expose a public endpoint (e.g., for ChatGPT Apps).
   - Use `--non-interactive` in CI/CD to reuse stored secrets.

3. **Describe the deployment:**

   ```bash
   mcp-agent cloud servers describe utilities-server
   ```

   Copy the `Server URL` for client integration.

## Configure clients

Use either `mcp-agent install` (writes files automatically) or `mcp-agent configure --client` (prints snippets).

```bash
mcp-agent install https://<app_id>.deployments.mcp-agent.com/sse \
  --client cursor

mcp-agent configure https://<app_id>.deployments.mcp-agent.com/sse \
  --client vscode --write
```

`<app_id>` is the hostname reported by the CLI (for example, `app_abc123xyz.deployments.mcp-agent.com`).

For unauthenticated deployments (e.g., ChatGPT Apps), remember to deploy with `--no-auth` and run:

```bash
mcp-agent install <server-url> --client chatgpt
```

## Operate and monitor

Even though these servers do not use Temporal, you still get the operational surface:

- `mcp-agent cloud servers list` – inventory of deployed servers.
- `mcp-agent cloud logger tail utilities-server --follow` – live logs.
- `mcp-agent cloud servers delete utilities-server` – tear down when finished.
- `mcp-agent cloud configure --id <url>` – collect user-specific secrets if needed.

## Upgrade path to full agents

Start simple and layer on durability when required:

```python
# Initial FastMCP tool
@mcp.tool()
async def fetch_issue(repo: str, number: int) -> dict: ...

# Later: wrap inside MCPApp to reuse the tool and add workflows
from mcp_agent.app import MCPApp
app = MCPApp(name="issue_triage")

@app.tool
async def fetch_issue(repo: str, number: int) -> dict: ...

@app.async_tool
async def triage_issue(repo: str, number: int) -> dict:
    # Durable workflow that assigns, notifies, etc.
    ...
```

Redeploy with the same name and clients keep working while gaining new capabilities (`workflows-get_status`, pause/resume, etc.).

## Checklist for MCP server deployments

- [ ] Entrypoint (`main.py`) starts the server when executed.
- [ ] `mcp_agent.config.yaml` references the command + args.
- [ ] `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` included.
- [ ] Secrets captured in `mcp_agent.secrets.yaml` (if needed).
- [ ] `.mcpacignore` excludes large/unnecessary files.
- [ ] Deployment tested locally with `uv run main.py` or `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`.
- [ ] Documentation for consumers (URL, sample tool calls, auth mode).
