## Overview

mcp-agent provides two execution engines that determine how agent workflows are executed and managed. Each engine offers different capabilities for reliability, persistence, and deployment scenarios.

## Execution Engines

### asyncio Engine

The asyncio engine runs workflows in-memory using Python's native async/await capabilities.

**Characteristics:**
- In-memory execution
- No external dependencies
- Fast startup and iteration
- Best for development and simple deployments
- State lost on process restart

**Configuration:**
```yaml
execution_engine: asyncio
```

**Use cases:**
- Local development
- Quick prototyping
- Stateless operations
- Single-node deployments

### Temporal Engine

The Temporal engine provides durable workflow execution with automatic state persistence.

**Characteristics:**
- Durable execution across restarts
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Workflow history and replay
- Distributed execution support
- Requires Temporal server

**Configuration:**
```yaml
execution_engine: temporal
temporal:
  host: "localhost:7233"
  namespace: "default"
  task_queue: "mcp-agent"
```

**Use cases:**
- Production deployments
- Long-running workflows
- Critical operations requiring reliability
- Multi-node deployments
- Workflows requiring pause/resume

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** The [Temporal workflow gallery](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent/tree/main/examples/temporal) showcases orchestrator, router, and evaluator/optimizer patterns running on this engine.

## Executors

Executors are the runtime components that actually execute workflows within an engine.

### AsyncioExecutor

Handles workflow execution for the asyncio engine:

```python
from mcp_agent.executor.executor import AsyncioExecutor

async def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hi {name}"

executor = AsyncioExecutor()
result = await executor.execute(greet, "Ada")
print(result)  # "Hi Ada"
```

**Features:**
- Direct Python function execution
- Native async/await support
- Minimal overhead

See it in action in the [basic workflows examples](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent/tree/main/examples/workflows) where tasks run entirely in-process.

### TemporalExecutor

Manages workflow execution for the Temporal engine:

```python
from mcp_agent.executor.temporal import TemporalExecutor
from mcp_agent.config import TemporalSettings

executor = TemporalExecutor(config=TemporalSettings(
    host="localhost:7233",
    namespace="default",
    task_queue="mcp-agent",
))
handle = await executor.start_workflow("ResearchWorkflow", {"topic": "LLMs"})
result = await handle.result()
```

**Features:**
- Workflow versioning
- Activity retries
- Distributed execution
- Workflow queries and signals

The [`examples/oauth/pre_authorize`](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent/tree/main/examples/oauth/pre_authorize) project combines this executor with OAuth-aware workflows.

## Choosing an Execution Engine

### Development Phase

Use asyncio engine during development:
- Fast iteration cycles
- No infrastructure requirements
- Immediate feedback
- Simple debugging

### Production Phase

Consider Temporal engine for production:
- Workflow reliability
- Automatic failure handling
- Audit trail via workflow history
- Horizontal scaling

## Execution Context

Both engines provide an execution context to workflows:

```python
@app.workflow
async def my_workflow(ctx: WorkflowContext, params: dict):
    # Access execution context
    workflow_id = ctx.workflow_id
    run_id = ctx.run_id
    
    # Engine-specific features
    if ctx.engine == "temporal":
        # Temporal-specific operations
        await ctx.sleep(timedelta(hours=1))
    
    return result
```

## Engine-Specific Features

### asyncio Features

- **Direct execution**: Workflows run as standard Python functions
- **Memory state**: State maintained in process memory
- **Simple cancellation**: Standard asyncio cancellation

### Temporal Features

- **Workflow replay**: Deterministic replay from history
- **Signals**: Send data to running workflows
- **Queries**: Query workflow state without affecting execution
- **Child workflows**: Spawn and manage child workflow instances
- **Timers**: Durable sleep and timeouts
- **Activities**: Retryable units of work

## Migration Between Engines

Workflows written for mcp-agent can run on either engine without modification:

```python
# This workflow runs on both engines
@app.workflow
async def portable_workflow(ctx: WorkflowContext, input: dict):
    agent = Agent(
        name="researcher",
        instruction="Research the topic",
        server_names=["fetch"]
    )
    
    async with agent:
        llm = await agent.attach_llm(OpenAIAugmentedLLM)
        result = await llm.generate_str(input["query"])
    
    return result
```

## Performance Considerations

### asyncio Engine
- **Latency**: Microseconds for workflow start
- **Throughput**: Limited by single process
- **Memory**: All state in RAM
- **Reliability**: No persistence

### Temporal Engine
- **Latency**: Milliseconds for workflow start
- **Throughput**: Horizontally scalable
- **Memory**: State persisted to database
- **Reliability**: Survives crashes and restarts

## Configuration Examples

### Basic asyncio Setup
```yaml
execution_engine: asyncio
logger:
  level: info
```

### Production Temporal Setup
```yaml
execution_engine: temporal
temporal:
  host: "temporal.production.internal:7233"
  namespace: "production"
  task_queue: "agent-workflows"
  worker_count: 4
  max_concurrent_activities: 20
```

## Accessing the executor in an application

`MCPApp` exposes the active executor and engine selection:

```python
async with app.run() as running_app:
    executor = running_app.executor
    print(executor.execution_engine)  # "asyncio" or "temporal"
```

You typically call high-level helpers (`workflow.execute()`, `executor.start_workflow`) rather than invoking executor methods directly, but the property is available when you need advanced control or diagnostics.
