# Service Configuration Reference

This is a comprehensive reference. See also {doc}`../how-to/configuration` for a
practical guide with examples.

## Configuration merging rules

If there are multiple configuration files:

* At most one may contain an ``authentication:`` section.
* More than one may contain a ``tree:`` section, but if the same ``path``
  occurs in more than one file, or if colliding paths like ``/a`` and ``/a/b``
  are specified, an exception will be raised.
* If there is more than one ``allow_origins`` section their contents are merged.
* The behavior of other top-level collisions are currently undefined and will
  likely be made strict in the future.

The content below is automatically generated from a schema that is used
to validate configuration files when they are read.

## Environment variable expansion

Any values with environment variables, given as `$VAR` or `${VAR}`, will be
expanded (i.e. filled in) with their values.
