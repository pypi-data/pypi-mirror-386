    '''A table populated from a YOLO dataset, defined by a YAML file and a split.

    The `TableFromYolo` class is an interface between 3LC and the YOLO data format. The YAML file must contain the
    keys `path`, `names` and the provided `split`. If the path in the YAML file is relative, a set of alternatives are
    tried: The directory with the YAML file, the parent of this directory and the
    current working directory.

    :Example:
    ```python
    table = TableFromYolo(
        input_url="path/to/yaml/file.yaml",
        split="train",
    )
    print(table.table_rows[0])
    ```

    :param input_url: The Url to the YOLO YAML file to parse.
    :param split: The split of the dataset to use. Default is "val".
    :param datasets_dir_url: The Url to prepend to the \'path\' in the YAML file if it is relative. If not provided, the
        directory where the YAML sits is used.
    :param override_split_path: A list of paths to override the paths in the YAML file. If provided, the \'path\' and
        \'<split>\' in the YAML file are ignored.

    The keypoints are stored in YOLO label format, which consists of a single file per image, where each line contains
    the class index, the bounding box coordinates and the keypoint coordinates.

    The dataset YAML file must contain the keys `path`, `names` and the provided `split`. For pose estimation tasks,
    only a single class is expected.

    In addition, the dataset YAML file should contain the ultralytics-compatible keys `kpt_shape`, which is a list of
    two integers, the first being the number of keypoints and the second being the number of channels; 2 for keypoints
    only, 3 for keypoints with visibility flag, and `flip_idx`, which are stored in the Table's
    Schema, enabling flip-augmentation when used during training.

    Finally, for convenience, all keypoint related arguments can also be provided in the dataset yaml file.

    See (Table.from_yolo) for descriptions of all arguments.
