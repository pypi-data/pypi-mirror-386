    :::{admonition} Updating Runs with Metrics Tables
    A MetricsTableWriter is a specialized
    {class}`TableWriter<tlc.core.writers.table_writer.TableWriter>` that writes tables inside a run\'s directory. The
    MetricsTableWriter does not update the run to reference the newly written tables. To do that, call
    {func}`Run.update_metrics<tlc.core.objects.mutable_objects.run.Run.update_metrics>` with the return value of
    {func}`get_written_metrics_infos<tlc.core.writers.metrics_writer.MetricsTableWriter.get_written_metrics_infos>`.
    :::

    If a `foreign_table_url` is supplied, the written metrics table will also be associated with the given foreign
    table, indicating that each metric value is associated with a specific row in the foreign table.

    For this to work, each added metrics batch must contain a column called `example_id`. This is the foreign key that
    links the metrics table to the foreign table. The values of `example_id` are linear indices into the foreign table,
    starting from 0. A single metrics table can contain multiple values for the same `example_id`, and does not need to
    contain values for all `example_id`s in the foreign table.

    :Example:
    ```python
    from tlc import MetricsTableWriter

    # Assuming a input table of length 8 exists at the url "input_table_url"

    run = tlc.init()

    metrics_writer = MetricsTableWriter(
        run_url=run.url,
        foreign_table_url="input_table_url",
        foreign_table_display_name="Input Table",
    )

    # First batch of metrics, corresponding to the first 4 rows of the foreign table
    metrics_writer.add_batch({
        "loss": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], "example_id": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    })

    # Second batch of metrics, corresponding to the last 4 rows of the foreign table
    metrics_writer.add_batch({
        "loss": [0.2, 0.4, 0.1, 0.5], "example_id": [4, 5, 6, 7],
    })

    # Finalize the metrics writer to write the metrics table to persistent storage
    metrics_table = metrics_writer.finalize()

    # Add a reference to the written metrics table to the run
    run.update_metrics(metrics_writer.get_written_metrics_infos())
    ```
