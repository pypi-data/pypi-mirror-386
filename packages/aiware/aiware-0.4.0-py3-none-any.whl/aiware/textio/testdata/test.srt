00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,470
Hi, welcome to Yoga
for neck and shoulders. My name

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,000
is Rosa and I will be guiding
you through this practice. Our

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,200
focus today will be on the neck
and shoulder area where we want

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,680
to prevent pain or release
discomfort if you're already

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,470
experiencing it. And we're going
to work against the posture that

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,550
so many of us have when we sit
and work with our smartphones or

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,660
computers, so hunching forward,
and instead we want to lift up

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,630
an elevate through the spine,
especially through the neck,

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,400
rolling the shoulders back and
down and away from each other.

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,710
Let's combine that with our
breath and a little shoulder

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,570
rotation. So on your next
inhale, reach your shoulders up

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,260
to your ears and as you hunched
forward through the upper back

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,180
and exhaling slide your shoulder
blades back down and away from

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,100
each other. Inhale hunched
forward, shoulders to ears.

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,400
Exhale, shoulders back down and
away from each other. Close your

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,690
eyes. Inhale forward, up. Exhale
back down and away from each

17
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,480
other. And then take another two
rounds on your own breathing

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,300
deeply and feeling into your
shoulders.

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,860
And then on your next inhale,
open your eyes and come into all

20
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,370
fours, your pelvis is right on
top of your knees here and your

21
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,550
knees or hips width apart. That
means you can fit two fists in

22
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:56,340
between your knees. Your hands
come down under your shoulders,

23
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,730
fingers spreading super wide,
middle fingers facing forward

24
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:07,560
and your core is engaged. And
breathe deeply here. So in yoga,

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,530
we have a lot of poses where we
put weight on our hands such as

26
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,060
all fours and plank and down dog
and later on arm imbalances. And

27
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,210
it is crucial to have a healthy
alignment in your shoulders for

28
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,030
all of these poses because if
you don't you risk wrecking your

29
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,400
neck over time. So please take a
look as I show you how to align

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,290
your shoulders. Instead of
rolling your upper arms inwards

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,820
and hunching forward as I'm
doing here. Roll your upper arms

32
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,980
outwards, the soft part of your
elbows face forward and smile at

33
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,380
whatever is ahead of you. The
same time your shoulders pulled

34
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,470
back into their sockets and your
heart is reaching forward.

35
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:58,680
Again, core is engaged. So let's
do that together. As you inhale,

36
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,770
roll your upper arms inwards
hunching forward

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,930
and exhale, roll them outwards
insides of elbows facing

38
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:17,020
forward. Once more, inhale
forward and exhale, hunching. So

39
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,990
feeding tension in the neck
here. And then again in how come

40
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:29,620
forward and stay activating your
shoulders. Take deep breaths,

41
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,410
breathing space between your
shoulder blades as you push the

42
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,910
knuckles of your hands down.

43
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,140
So now breathing into the space
that you created in your

44
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:50,160
shoulders and your neck and then
let's do a few rounds of cat and

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,150
cow here. So on your inhale
slowly roll up arching the spine

46
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:01,830
and exhale, roll down rounding
inhale starting at the bottom of

47
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,980
your spine one vertebra at a
time arching into Cow and exhale

48
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:14,460
vertebra by vertebra rounding
into cat pose. Take tumor rounds

49
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,330
on your own, really noticing
every single vertebra as you

50
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:18,630
move

51
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,980
and then I'll meet you in all
fours with a neutral spine.

52
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,310
Inhaling, press down through
your left hand, reach the right

53
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,030
arm up and exhale, rest the
right shoulder and your head

54
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,180
under your left shoulder.
Inhale, reach up through the

55
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,330
left hand placing your left hand
on your pelvis making sure that

56
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,650
your hips stay parallel to the
ground. And then you could stay

57
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,800
here this is a beautiful place
to stay or you could grab a hold

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,060
of your right thigh with your
left hand and breathe deeply

59
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:14,610
here using the shoulders away
from the ears, and as you

60
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,640
inhale, lift your left hand up
again. Exhale, rest your left

61
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,510
arm next to your left ear.
coming onto your left fingertips

62
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,050
fingers far ahead of you.
Shoulders stay away from your

63
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,610
ears. Inhale, pull your
shoulders away from your ears

64
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,030
again, and exhale, rest that
left shoulder on your right

65
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,470
upper arms, releasing the
weight. take three deep breaths,

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:54,350
And on your third, inhale, reach
up through your left hand and

68
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,720
exhale, place your left hand
down under your left shoulder

69
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,950
again. Inhale, reach up through
the right arm. And exhale, place

70
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,840
your right hand down under your
right shoulder.

71
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,070
On your inhale, reach out
through the left arm now and

72
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,130
exhaling release the left arm

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,580

74
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,240
And exhale, resting your right
hand on your tailbone making

75
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,520
sure that the hips stay square.
Your core is engaged. You could

76
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,610
keep your hand on your tailbone
or grab a hold of that left

77
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:43,550
thigh. And again, deep breaths
here. On your next inhale,

78
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,400
release your right hand and rest

80
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,840

81
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,130

84
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,090

pose here. So your knees are as
wide as the mat and your big

87
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,400

your elbows and rest your hands

88
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:42,610
in prayer pose thumbs on your
neck. You don't know what I'm

89
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,740
talking about. Just take a look

90
00:07:47,740 --> 00:08:13,660
release your head soften your
jaw and breathe deeply. From

91
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,470

as far forward as possible.

92
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,380
Pressing your hands down

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,770

Inhale, pull your shoulders away

between your feet and your head

101
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,370

your fingers behind your back

102
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,150
and on your inhale. Pull your
hands forward and up towards the

103
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,950

them go towards the ground.

104
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,680
engaged with the belly. Shift
your weight further into the toe

105
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,380
side of your feet and take deep
breaths

106
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,250
then on your next exhale,
release your hands and place

107
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,940
your left hand on the ground of
foot length ahead and in between

108
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,930
your feet right underneath your
left shoulder. You could come

109
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,450
onto your fingertips if the
ground was easier to retrieve

110
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,110
that way. And then bend through
your left knee straight into the

111
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,290
right leg and press the left
hand or fingertips into the

112
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,040
ground. Inhale, pull your
shoulders away from your ears.

113
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,970
And exhale, twist towards the
right extending the right arm

114
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:04,250
up. Inhale here And exhale,
change sides. Right hand comes

115
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,270
down a foot length ahead and in
between your feet right

116
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,480
underneath your right shoulder.
Right knees bent, left leg is

117
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,820
straight, pressing the right
hand or fingertips into the

118
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,080
ground. Then reach out through
your left hand. Pull your

119
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,560
shoulders away from the ears,
take another deep breath. And

120
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,870
then come down, letting yourself
hang. On your next inhale, walk

121
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,780
your feet back, set your knees
down and come to sit on your

122
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,050
heels. You want to make sure
that you're comfortable here.

123
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,730
You'll stay here for a bit. So
feel free to press pause and

124
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,770
change your seat in any way that
you need to.

125
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,500
And then lift up through your
right arm, right shoulder stays

126
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,470
down, holding the right
fingertips up to the ceiling.

127
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,230
Take a deep inhale here,
engaging through your core.

128
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,970
Continually reaching up through
those fingertips. And then as

129
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,310
you exhale, place your right
hand between your shoulder

130
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,070
blades. You could take all that
space here. I really liked how

131
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,690
the skin feels in that area. So
maybe you can enjoy that. And

132
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,150
grab a hold of your right elbow
with your left hand gently

133
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,180
pulling the right elbow to
center shoulders stay low.

134
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,530
Inhale, reach to your heart,
reach to the crown of your head.

135
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,240
And then as you exhale, extend
the left arm to the side,

136
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:35,220
rotating the palm back and then
up. And now grab a hold of your

137
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,730
T shirt or another piece of
clothing or if it's available to

138
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,690
you your hand. It's important
that you establish tension here.

139
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,770
Then you're going to take three
breaths, keep reaching through

140
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,620
the heart and pulling down
through the shoulders gently

141
00:11:49,620 --> 00:12:23,880
leaning back in your upper back.
Soft face and strong core. Then

142
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,260
on your fourth inhale, very
slowly returned to center.

143
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,910
Bringing your arms into that T
shape again and rotating your

144
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,200
palms up and down, sharing some
love with your shoulders. And

145
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,910
then let's change sides when
you're ready to take your time.

146
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,590
Then you're going to lift up
through your left arm, your left

147
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,910
shoulder stays down, pulling the
left fingertips up to the

148
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:59,340
ceiling. Take an inhale here
engaging through the core. And

149
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,640
then as you exhale, place your
left hand between your shoulder

150
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,220
blades. Again, greeting that
space, Hello. Then grab a hold

151
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,760
of your left elbow with your
right hand. gently pulling the

152
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,040
left elbow to center shoulders
stay low. Inhale, reach through

153
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,120
your heart, reach to the crown
of your head. Exhale, gently

154
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,330
pull that elbow and then extend
the right arm to the side again

155
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,710
rotating the palm at first back
and then up and then grab a hold

156
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,000
on your T shirt or another piece
of clothing or if available your

157
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,990
hand. respect your boundaries
further isn't better. It's just

158
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,100
different. Then you're gonna
take three deep breaths,

159
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,370
reaching up through the heart
pulling down to the shoulders

160
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,720
again, you could start gently
leaning back in the upper back.

161
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:16,260
Keep engaging to the core then
on your fourth inhale slowly

162
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,710
return to center. Bring your
arms into that T shape again and

163
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,530
rotate your palms up and down
sharing some love with your

164
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,340
shoulders.

165
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,880
And then from here I will meet
you in plank pose so your hands

166
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,370
come down shoulder width apart
directly underneath your

167
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,430
shoulders. Your fingers are
spreading why and the knuckles

168
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,350
of your hands pressed down. Your
feet are hips width apart and

169
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,200
you have one long line from your
heels all the way to the crown

170
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,910
of your head. And then release
your knees to the ground. Come

171
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,870
onto your forearms, slowly
lowering the legs and the pelvis

172
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,590
down and tuck your toes your
feet or hips width apart or

173
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,240
wider To make sure that you have
a right angle in your elbow

174
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,460
joints, elbows placed directly
underneath your shoulders. Check

175
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,850
if you're able to grab a hold of
opposite elbows here and then

176
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,490
bring your forearms down, hands
parallel to your elbows. And

177
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,000
it's important here to keep on
pressing your wrists down and at

178
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,180
the same time pulling your
elbows towards your upper body,

179
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:29,270
without that being visible, just
noticeable for you. Engage to

180
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,230
your legs, press your big
toenails down, pull your pubic

181
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,230
bone to your belly button. Then
pull your shoulders back away

182
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,970
from your ears. take three deep
breaths, reaching forward

183
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:57,590
through your heart and back
through your shoulders. Keep

184
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:04,820
engaging the core. Keep
activating the legs. On your

185
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,510
third exhale, slowly release the
upper body and extend the right

186
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:13,010
arm forward. slowly rolling over
your right side come onto your

187
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:23,270
back and then walk your feet as
close to the pelvis as possible.

188
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,590
Make sure that your feet are
hips with apart. Your toes are

189
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,060
facing forward and your knees or
hips width apart to So feet and

190
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,990
knees are parallel that is
really important. And then from

191
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,850
here, lifting the pelvis began
to roll up one vertebra at a

192
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:48,350
time. coming towards bridge
pose. You could place your arms

193
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,660
parallel to each other
underneath your back or

194
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,520
interlace your fingers if
available to you. Rotate your

195
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,400
shoulders towards one another
creating a pillow for your neck

196
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:07,280
here. And take three more deep
breaths. Pressing your feet down

197
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,590
activating your legs with every
inhale.

198
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,900
with every exhale pulling your
sternum to your chin opening the

199
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:37,830
chest deep breaths don't let
your knees fall out here. On

200
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,490
your fourth inhale, release your
hands and one vertebra at a time

201
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,310
roll down as slowly as possible.

202
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,074
Really take your time here. and
once you're all the way down,

203
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:57,828
you are going to bring your feet
as wide as the mat let your

204
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:03,111
knees fall in towards one
another. And giving the lower

205
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:09,242
back permission to sink. Take a
deep inhale in through your nose

206
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:12,450
and exhale out the mouth, hahhhhh

207
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,410
Soften the shoulders, let the
head be heavy. then bring your

208
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:30,423
knees into your chest, grab a
hold of each knee with the

209
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:37,387
respective hand and breathe into
your hips here. Lower back stays

210
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:43,506

ground and when you're ready,

211
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:49,836

weight of your body and to the

213
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:03,024
ground. So some say that this is
the most important pose in yoga.

214
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:09,354
If you have time, I encourage
you to press pause and take a

215
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:11,570
good long rest here.

216
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,330
When you're ready, start to
deepen your breath, hugging your

forehead on your knees eyes are

221
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:49,788
