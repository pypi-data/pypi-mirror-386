Deepray is a repository of contributions that conform to well-
established API patterns, but implement new functionality not available
in core TensorFlow. TensorFlow natively supports a large number of
operators, layers, metrics, losses, and optimizers. However, in a fast
moving field like ML, there are many interesting new developments that
cannot be integrated into core TensorFlow (because their broad
applicability is not yet clear, or it is mostly used by a smaller subset
of the community).
