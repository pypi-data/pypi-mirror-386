    """
    Concurrent test for multiple MCP clients over different transports.

    This test verifies the functionality of the MCP client by:
    1. Launching a test server for the specified transport.
    2. Creating transport instances and MCP clients concurrently.
    3. Listing available tools and validating the response for each client.
    4. Calling a tool and verifying the result for each client.

    **Parameters:**
    - `run_fast_mcp_server`: Fixture to launch the test server.
    - `transport`: Transport type to test (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket).

    **Raises:**
    - `AssertionError`: If any validation fails.
    - `Exception`: If an unexpected error occurs during the test.
