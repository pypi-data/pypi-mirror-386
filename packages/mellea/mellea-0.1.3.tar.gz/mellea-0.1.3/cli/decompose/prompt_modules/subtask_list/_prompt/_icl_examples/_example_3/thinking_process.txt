To accomplish the task of writing a paper and then proposing refuting questions followed by a short essay, we need to break it down into logical steps. First, we need to gather information about Shanghai A Shipping Engineering Service Co., Ltd., focusing on its operational status. This information will be used to write a formal paper with a positive and steadily improving viewpoint. After completing the paper, we will generate three refuting questions from the perspective of a freshman majoring in marine engineering. These questions will challenge the views presented in the paper. Finally, we will select one of these questions and write a short essay that opposes the views expressed in the paper. The last step will be to piece together the formal paper, the three refuting questions, and the short essay to correctly answer what the task is asking.
