Your task is to generate positive test cases for the given user story. These test cases should cover the happy path scenarios, including preconditions, test steps, and expected outcomes.

First, review the user story analysis from the previous step:
<user_story_analysis>
{{USER_STORY_ANALYSIS}}
</user_story_analysis>

Next, identify the key features and functionalities of the user story that need to be tested. Consider the different scenarios that could occur when a user interacts with the application.

Then, generate positive test cases that cover these happy path scenarios. For each test case, include:

1. **Test Case**: A brief description of the test case.
2. **Precondition**: The conditions that must be met before the test case can be executed.
3. **Test Steps**: The steps that the user must take to execute the test case. These steps should start from launching the application onwards.
4. **Expected Outcome**: The expected outcome of the test case.

Ensure that the test cases are comprehensive and cover all the key features and functionalities of the user story.

If the user story is not provided, please wait for further instructions.

Finally, compile the positive test cases into a single output, using the following format:

```
POSITIVE TEST CASES:

1. **Test Case** [Test Case description]
**Precondition** [Precondition]
**Test Steps**
1. [Test Step 1]
2. [Test Step 2]
...
**Expected Outcome** [Expected Outcome]

2. **Test Case** [Test Case description]
**Precondition** [Precondition]
**Test Steps**
1. [Test Step 1]
2. [Test Step 2]
...
**Expected Outcome** [Expected Outcome]

...
```

Provide the positive test cases as your output.
