Identify the key features and functionalities of the user story that need to be tested. Consider the different scenarios that could occur when a user interacts with the application.

For each test case, include:
1. **Test Case**: A brief description of the test case.
2. **Precondition**: The conditions that must be met before the test case can be executed.
3. **Test Steps**: The steps that the user must take to execute the test case. These steps should start from launching the application onwards.
4. **Expected Outcome**: The expected outcome of the test case.

Ensure that the test cases are comprehensive and cover all the key features and functionalities of the user story.

Compile the positive test cases into a single output, using the following format:

```

1. **Test Case** [Test Case description]
