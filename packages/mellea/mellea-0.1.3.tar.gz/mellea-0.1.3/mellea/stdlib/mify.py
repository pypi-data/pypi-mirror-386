    Allows the object (or instances of the class) to be used in m sessions and with m functions.

    For the args below, only specify an _include or an _exclude of for fields and funcs. If both are specified,
    include takes precedence. If you specify the same item to be included and excluded, nothing will be included.

    If fields_include or fields_exclude are set:
    - the stringify_func will not be used to represent this object to the model
    - you must specify a template field or a template in the template_order field that handles a dict with those fields as keys
    - it's advised to use fields_include due to the many dunder fields and inherited fields an object/class might have

    Mify sets attributes on the object/class. If the object isn't already an mified/mobject, it will overwrite
    the attributes and methods of the object/class necessary for it to be mified.

    Args:
        obj: either a class or an instance of the class
        fields_include: fields of the object to include in its representation to models
        fields_exclude: fields of the object to exclude from its representation to models
        funcs_include: functions of the object to include in its representation to models
        funcs_exclude: functions of the object to exclude from its representation to models
        query_type: a specific query component type to use when querying a model
        transform_type: a specific transform component type to use when transforming with a model
        template: a string representation of a jinja template; takes precedence over template_order
        template_order: a template ordering to use when searching for applicable templates
        parsing_func: not yet implemented
        stringify_func: used to create a string representation of the object

    Returns:
        An object if an object was passed in or a decorator (callable) to mify classes.

        If an object is returned, that object will be the same object that was passed in.
        For example,
        ```
        obj = mify(obj)
        obj.format_for_llm()
        ```
        and
        ```
        mify(obj)
        obj.format_for_llm()
        ```
        are equivalent.

        Most IDEs will not correctly show the type hints for the newly added functions
        for either an mify object or instances of an mified class. For IDE support, write
