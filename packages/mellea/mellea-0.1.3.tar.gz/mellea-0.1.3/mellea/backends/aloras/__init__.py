    """Activated LoRAs (Aloras)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12397) are are [low-rank adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) that can reuse KV cache from their underlying model.

    This class should not be directly subclassed by a specific ALora. Each backend that supports ALora should provide a backend-specific abstract class that subclasses `ALora`. Individual ALoras should then be defined by subclassing the model-specific backend.

    ALoras are always attached to an underlying model and use the following calling convention:
    1. The underlying model is prompted (without the Alora active). We call this the `input`.
    2. The underlying model generates some tokens from the `input` context (again, without the ALora active). We call this the `response`.
    3. Then the adapter is activated and generates some tokens. We call then the `alora_response`.

    Args:
        name (str): An arbitrary name/label in the model serving engine (e.g. vllm, or local huggingface) to assign to an ALora. This is irrelevant from the alora's (huggingface) model id.
