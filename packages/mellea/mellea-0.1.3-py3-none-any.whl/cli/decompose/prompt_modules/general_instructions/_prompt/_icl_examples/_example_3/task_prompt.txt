Your task is to condense the summary to fit within the 600 character limit and format it into 3 paragraphs or less. 

First, review the news article understanding and celebrity inclusion from the previous steps:
<news_article_understanding>
{{ARTICLE_UNDERSTANDING}}
</news_article_understanding>
<celebrity_inclusion>
{{CELEBRITY_INCLUSION}}
</celebrity_inclusion>

Next, condense the summary while maintaining the essential information and the inclusion of the celebrity name. Ensure the summary is concise and clear.

Finally, format the condensed summary into 3 paragraphs or less, ensuring it does not exceed the 600 character limit.
