Here's a quick checklist in what to include:

- [ ] Include a detailed description of the bug. Describe what you were trying to get done. Tell us what happened, what went wrong, and what you expected to happen.
- [ ] Output of `intake_esgf.__version__`
- [ ] Minimal, self-contained copy-pastable example that generates the issue if possible. Please be concise with code posted. See guidelines below on how to provide a good bug report:

  - [Minimal Complete Verifiable Examples](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)
  - [Craft Minimal Bug Reports](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports)

Bug reports that follow these guidelines are easier to diagnose, and so are often handled much more quickly.
