# file-tag-parser
A tag-based filename parser for imaging data.

This library is designed to make parsing of arbitrary filenames attainable and searchable via a pandas-based database. 
Each filename can then be interpreted and/or manipulated for whatever processing and analysis is desired.

At the moment, the library is solely dedicated to the interpretation of complex filenames using
a "tagging system", to streamline their grouping and loading. This will likely be expanded in the future as needed.
