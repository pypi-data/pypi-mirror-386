## Installation

The GPL version of PyQt6-Graphs can be installed from PyPI:

    pip install PyQt6-Graphs

`pip` will also build and install the bindings from the sdist package but Qt's
`qmake` tool must be on `PATH`.

The `sip-install` tool will also install the bindings from the sdist package
but will allow you to configure many aspects of the installation.
