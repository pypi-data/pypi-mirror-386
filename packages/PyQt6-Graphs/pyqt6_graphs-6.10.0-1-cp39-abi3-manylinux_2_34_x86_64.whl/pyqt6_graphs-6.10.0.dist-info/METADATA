# PyQt6-Graphs - Python Bindings for the Qt Graphs Library

PyQt6-Graphs is a set of Python bindings for The Qt Company's Qt Graphs
library.  The bindings sit on top of PyQt6 and are implemented as two separate
modules corresponding to the different libraries that make up the framework.

## Installation

The GPL version of PyQt6-Graphs can be installed from PyPI:

    pip install PyQt6-Graphs

`pip` will also build and install the bindings from the sdist package but Qt's
`qmake` tool must be on `PATH`.

The `sip-install` tool will also install the bindings from the sdist package
but will allow you to configure many aspects of the installation.
