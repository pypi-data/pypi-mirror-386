"""Device health check routines for quantum dot devices operating in accumulation mode.

These routines are specifically designed for accumulation mode devices, where gates are
swept from depletion to accumulation to establish conductive channels. The algorithms
identify turn-on voltages where current begins to flow as gates transition from depleted
to accumulated states.

Voltage Bounds and Carrier Type Conventions
--------------------------------------------
The safe voltage bounds (max_safe_voltage_bound and min_safe_voltage_bound) represent the
extreme voltages that can be safely applied to gates without causing device damage or
unwanted leakage. The interpretation of these bounds depends on the charge carrier type:

For electron-based devices (n-channel, charge_carrier_type="electron"):
    - Accumulation occurs at POSITIVE gate voltages, which attract electrons to form
      a conductive channel
    - max_safe_voltage_bound is POSITIVE and represents the maximum safe positive voltage
    - min_safe_voltage_bound is NEGATIVE and represents the most negative voltage (depletion)
    - Current INCREASES as gate voltage sweeps from negative (depleted) to positive (accumulated)

For hole-based devices (p-channel, charge_carrier_type="hole"):
    - Accumulation occurs at NEGATIVE gate voltages, which attract holes to form
      a conductive channel
    - max_safe_voltage_bound is POSITIVE and represents the most positive voltage (depletion)
    - min_safe_voltage_bound is NEGATIVE and represents the maximum safe negative voltage
    - Current INCREASES as gate voltage sweeps from positive (depleted) to negative (accumulated)

In both cases, the routines sweep from depletion (low current) toward accumulation (high current),
but the voltage polarity is reversed between electron and hole devices. The charge_carrier_type
parameter determines which voltage bound is used for accumulation sweeps.

    This routine systematically tests for electrical leakage between all pairs of control gates
    by sweeping each gate through its voltage range and measuring the current response on all
    other gates. Leakage is quantified as resistance (dV/dI) between gate pairs. Gates with
    resistance below the threshold indicate potential shorts or unwanted crosstalk.

    The test sweeps both positive (max_voltage_bound) and negative (min_voltage_bound) directions
    from the initial voltages to detect asymmetric leakage behavior. Both bounds are tested
    independently, so failure at one bound does not prevent testing the other.

    Note on voltage bounds: max_safe_voltage_bound is typically positive and min_safe_voltage_bound
    is typically negative, representing the extreme safe operating voltages. For electron devices,
    max (positive) is used for accumulation sweeps; for hole devices, min (negative) is used for
    accumulation sweeps. See module-level docstring for detailed explanation.

    Args:
        ctx: Routine context containing device resources. Uses ctx.results.get("current_std")
             if available from noise_floor_measurement, otherwise defaults to 1e-10 A.

                                     Lower values indicate more stringent leakage requirements.
        leakage_threshold_count: Maximum number of leaky gate pairs allowed before failing the test.
                                Default is 0 (any leakage causes failure).
        num_points: Number of voltage steps to test in each direction. Default is 10.
        session: Optional logger session for recording leakage matrices and analysis results.
