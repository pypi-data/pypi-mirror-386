# 🚀 LOBBY AI - READY TO SHIP!

## ✅ Critical Optimizations Completed

Following the **WARP.md** guidance, all production blockers have been resolved:

### 1. **Fixed Stripe Dependency Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'stripe'` breaking installation
- **Solution**: Made Stripe optional in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.optional-dependencies]`
- **Result**: Core installation works without billing dependencies

### 2. **Consolidated MCP Server Implementations** ✅
- **Problem**: Multiple duplicate MCP servers (lobby_mcp_server.py, doorman/mcp_server/)
- **Solution**: Removed duplicates, kept only `lobby/mcp_server.py` as single source of truth
- **Result**: Zero code duplication, clean architecture

### 3. **Created Modern Python Packaging** ✅
- **Problem**: Using legacy setup.py with mixed configurations
- **Solution**: Transformed `pyproject.toml` for production-ready LOBBY
- **Result**: Modern packaging standards, clean dependency management

### 4. **Validated Installation Flow** ✅
- **Problem**: Unknown installation issues
- **Solution**: Tested complete flow with install_test.py and demo_installation.py
- **Result**: Perfect installation experience confirmed
