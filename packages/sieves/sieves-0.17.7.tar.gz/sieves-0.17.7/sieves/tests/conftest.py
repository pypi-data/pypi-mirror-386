            History is the systematic study of the past. As an academic discipline, it analyzes and interprets evidence
            to construct narratives about what happened and explain why it happened, focusing primarily on the human
            past. Some theorists categorize history as a social science, while others see it as part of the humanities

            its main aim is theoretical, to uncover the truth, or practical, to learn lessons from the past. In a
            slightly different sense, the term history refers not to an academic field but to the past itself or to
            individual texts about the past.

            Sociology is the scientific study of human society that focuses on society, human social behavior, patterns
            of social relationships, social interaction, and aspects of culture associated with everyday life. Regarded
            as a part of both the social sciences and humanities, sociology uses various methods of empirical
            investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order and social change.
            Sociological subject matter ranges from micro-level analyses of individual interaction and agency to
            macro-level analyses of social systems and social structure. Applied sociological research may be applied
            directly to social policy and welfare, whereas theoretical approaches may focus on the understanding of
            social processes and phenomenological method.

            After all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the people, a majority are
            permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule is not because they are most likely to be in the right,
            nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they are physically the strongest. But a
            government in which the majority rule in all cases cannot be based on justice, even as far as men
            understand it. Can there not be a government in which majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong,
            but conscience?- in which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is
            applicable? Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the
            legislation? Why has every man a conscience, then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects
            afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only
            obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right. It is truly enough
            said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with
            a conscience.
