   ```

3. **Configure API Keys** (for testing)
   - Copy the example configuration file
   - Add your test API keys (use test/sandbox keys when possible)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_specific_module.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=AgentCrew --cov-report=html
```

### Code Quality Checks

Before submitting your contribution, ensure your code passes quality checks:

```bash
# Code formatting (if using black)
black AgentCrew/ tests/

# Linting (if using flake8 or ruff)
flake8 AgentCrew/ tests/

# Type checking (if using mypy)
mypy AgentCrew/
```

## üêõ Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Clear Description**: What you expected vs. what happened
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to recreate the issue
- **Environment Details**: OS, Python version, AgentCrew version
- **Error Messages**: Full error traceback if available
- **Configuration**: Relevant parts of your config (remove sensitive data)

**Use our issue template when available** - it helps us understand and resolve
issues faster.

## üí° Suggesting Features

For feature requests:

- **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
- **Describe the problem** your feature would solve
- **Explain your proposed solution** with examples if possible
- **Consider alternatives** and mention any you've explored
- **Discuss impact** on existing functionality

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow **PEP 8** Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Add docstrings to classes and functions
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Architecture Principles

- **Modularity**: Keep components loosely coupled
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should have one clear purpose
- **Observer Pattern**: Use the existing Observable/Observer pattern for events
- **Service-Oriented**: Follow the existing service-based architecture
- **Configuration-Driven**: Make features configurable when possible

### Adding New Features

1. **Discuss First**: For significant features, open an issue to discuss the
   approach
2. **Follow Patterns**: Study existing code patterns (agents, tools, services)
3. **Update Documentation**: Include docstrings and update relevant docs
4. **Add Tests**: Include unit tests for new functionality
5. **Update Configuration**: Add any new config options to the schema

### Working with Agents

When creating or modifying agents:

- Extend `BaseAgent` or `LocalAgent` appropriately
- Implement all required methods
- Follow the established tool registration pattern
- Add appropriate error handling
- Test with multiple LLM providers when possible

### Working with Tools

For new tools:

- Create tool definition and handler functions
- Follow the existing tool registration pattern
- Include proper input validation
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Document tool capabilities and limitations

### GUI Development

For Qt GUI improvements:

- Follow the existing component-based structure
- Maintain consistency with current styling
- Test across different screen sizes
- Ensure accessibility considerations
- Update relevant themes if adding new UI elements

## üìù Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Fork the repository and create a feature branch
- [ ] Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Add tests for new functionality
- [ ] Check that your changes don't break existing features

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Use a Clear Title**: Summarize what your PR does
2. **Describe Changes**: Explain what you changed and why
3. **Reference Issues**: Link to related issues using "Fixes #123"
4. **Add Screenshots**: For UI changes, include before/after screenshots
5. **List Breaking Changes**: Highlight any breaking changes
6. **Update Changelog**: Add entry to CHANGELOG.md if one exists

### Review Process

- PRs require review from maintainers
- Address feedback promptly and constructively
- Be patient - reviews take time, especially for complex changes
- Feel free to ask questions if feedback isn't clear

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage

- Aim for high test coverage on new code
- Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Mock external services (APIs, databases) in tests

### Test Organization

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Mirror the source code structure in test files
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests in test classes

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows (use sparingly)
- **API Tests**: Test tool integrations and external service calls

## üìö Documentation

### Types of Documentation

- **Code Documentation**: Docstrings, inline comments
- **User Documentation**: README, installation guides, tutorials
- **API Documentation**: Tool definitions, service interfaces
- **Developer Documentation**: Architecture notes, design decisions

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use proper Markdown formatting
