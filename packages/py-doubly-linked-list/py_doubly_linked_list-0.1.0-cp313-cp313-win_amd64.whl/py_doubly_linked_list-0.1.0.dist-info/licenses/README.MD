# py-doubly-linked-list
## Description
This library provides an implementation of a doubly linked list for python written with the c api. It is meant to be as close as possible to a regular list in its interface, meaning you can interact with it in almost all of the same ways you interact with a regular python list.
## Methods
- append  
Append object to the end of the list. Set forward to false to append to the start.  
```Python
doubly_linked_list.append(object: Any, forward: bool = True)
```
- clear  
Remove all items from the list.  
```Python
doubly_linked_list.clear()
```
- copy  
Return a shallow copy of the list.  
```Python
doubly_linked_list.copy()
```
- count  
Return number of occurrences of value in the list.  
```Python
doubly_linked_list.count(value: Any)
```
- extend  
Extend list by appending elements from the iterable. Set forward to false to extend from the start.  
```Python
doubly_linked_list.extend(iterable: Iterable, forward: bool = True)
```
- index  
Return first index of value. Raises ValueError if the value is not present.  
```Python
doubly_linked_list.index(value: Any, start: int, stop: int)
```
- insert  
Insert object after index. Set forward to false to insert before index.  
```Python
doubly_linked_list.insert(object: Any, index: int, forward: bool = True)
```
- pop  
Remove and return item at index (default last). Raises IndexError if list is empty or index is out of range.  
```Python
doubly_linked_list.pop(index: int = -1)
```
- remove  
Remove first occurence of value. Raises ValueError if the value is not present.  
```Python
doubly_linked_list.remove(value: Any)
```
- reverse  
Reverse the order of the list.  
```Python
doubly_linked_list.reverse()
```
The DoublyLinkedList also supports:
- concatenation with other iterables
- in-place concatenation with other iterables
- indexing and assignment by index
- slicing
- iterating  

Things that are not currently supported but might be in the future:
- sorting
- assigning slices
- repeating, i.e list = [1] * 5 create a list with 1 repeated 5 times
