# LaunchAgent Permissions Solution Report

## Problem Summary

The Spiritual Library MCP Server's LaunchAgent service was experiencing a critical issue where it could not access documents in the CloudDocs directory. Despite correct environment variable configuration, the service consistently reported finding 0 documents while manual execution found 8,323 documents.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Investigation
- **Environment Variables**: ✅ Correctly set (`PERSONAL_LIBRARY_DOC_PATH` pointing to CloudDocs)
- **Path Resolution**: ✅ Logs showed correct CloudDocs path being used
- **Directory Existence**: ✅ Directory existed and was accessible manually

### The Core Issue: LaunchAgent Sandboxing
LaunchAgent services on macOS run with restricted permissions when executing Python scripts directly:
- **Sandboxed Environment**: Limited access to user directories like iCloud/CloudDocs
- **Permission Context**: Different from user shell context
- **File System Access**: Restricted `os.walk()` and file enumeration capabilities

### Evidence
- **Manual Execution**: `./scripts/run.sh` found 8,323 documents ✅
- **Direct LaunchAgent**: Python script via LaunchAgent found 0 documents ❌
- **Shell Script via LaunchAgent**: Found 8,200 documents ✅

## Solution: LaunchAgent → Shell Script → Python Architecture

### Implementation
Instead of LaunchAgent directly executing Python scripts:
```
OLD: LaunchAgent → Python Script (FAILED - 0 documents)
NEW: LaunchAgent → Shell Script → Python Script (SUCCESS - 8,200+ documents)
```

### Key Changes

#### 1. Service Wrapper Script (`scripts/index_monitor_service.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Service wrapper that inherits full user permissions
# Provides environment setup, signal handling, and process management

# Environment validation with document counting
doc_count=$(gtimeout 10 find "$PERSONAL_LIBRARY_DOC_PATH" -type f \( -name "*.pdf" -o -name "*.docx" -o -name "*.doc" -o -name "*.epub" \) 2>/dev/null | wc -l || echo "0")
log "Found $doc_count documents in books directory"

# Start Python indexer with proper environment
"$venv_python" "$python_script" --service \
    --books-dir "$PERSONAL_LIBRARY_DOC_PATH" \
    --db-dir "$PERSONAL_LIBRARY_DB_PATH" &
```

#### 2. Updated LaunchAgent Plist
```xml
<key>ProgramArguments</key>
<array>
    <string>/Users/KDP/AITools/scripts/index_monitor_service.sh</string>
    <string>run</string>
</array>
```

#### 3. Simplified Environment Variables
Removed complex Python-specific variables, kept only essential paths:
```xml
<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
<dict>
    <key>PATH</key>
    <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin</string>
    <key>PERSONAL_LIBRARY_DOC_PATH</key>
    <string>/Users/KDP/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/Books</string>
    <key>PERSONAL_LIBRARY_DB_PATH</key>
    <string>/Users/KDP/AITools/chroma_db</string>
</dict>
```

## Results

### Before (Direct Python Execution)
```
INFO:__main__:find_new_or_modified_documents returned 0 documents
INFO:__main__:All documents are up to date
```

### After (Shell Script Wrapper)
```
[2025-07-09 02:35:35] Found 8200 documents in books directory
[2025-07-09 02:35:35] Environment validation complete  
[2025-07-09 02:35:35] Started Python indexer with PID 46849
```

### Service Status
- **Service State**: ✅ RUNNING (stable, no restart loops)
- **Memory Usage**: 2MB (efficient)
- **Document Detection**: ✅ 8,200+ documents found
- **Lock System**: ✅ Working properly (confirmed via web monitor)
- **File Monitoring**: ✅ Active and responsive

## Technical Benefits

### 1. **Permission Inheritance**
Shell scripts inherit full user permissions when launched by LaunchAgent, bypassing sandboxing restrictions.

### 2. **Environment Consistency**
Same environment as manual execution, eliminating permission discrepancies.

### 3. **Robust Process Management**
- Clean signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
- Graceful shutdown with timeout
- PID tracking and health monitoring

### 4. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Separate logging for shell script vs Python process
- Environment validation with document counting
- Clear separation of concerns

### 5. **Production Reliability**
- No restart loops due to permission failures
- Stable service operation
- Proper resource management

## Best Practices Learned

### 1. **macOS LaunchAgent Architecture**
For services requiring full user directory access:
```
✅ RECOMMENDED: LaunchAgent → Shell Script → Application
❌ AVOID: LaunchAgent → Python/Application (direct)
```

### 2. **Environment Variable Strategy**
- Keep LaunchAgent environment minimal
- Let shell scripts handle complex environment setup
- Use explicit path passing to applications

### 3. **Permission Testing**
Always test with the exact service execution context:
```bash
# Test shell script independently
./scripts/service_wrapper.sh run

# Test LaunchAgent service
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/service.plist
```

### 4. **Debugging Approach**
- Implement validation logging in wrapper scripts
- Use timeouts for operations that might hang in service context
- Separate stdout/stderr for shell vs application logs

## Implementation Files

### Key Files Modified/Created
- ✅ `scripts/index_monitor_service.sh` - Service wrapper script
- ✅ `config/com.spiritual-library.index-monitor.plist` - Updated LaunchAgent config
- ✅ `scripts/install_service.sh` - Updated installation script

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check service status
./scripts/service_status.sh

# View service logs
tail -f logs/index_monitor_service.log
tail -f logs/index_monitor_stderr.log

# Test wrapper independently  
./scripts/index_monitor_service.sh run
```

## Conclusion

The LaunchAgent → Shell Script → Python architecture successfully resolved macOS permission restrictions for CloudDocs access. This pattern should be used for any LaunchAgent service requiring full user directory access on macOS.

**Key Takeaway**: When LaunchAgent services need to access user directories (especially iCloud/CloudDocs), use a shell script wrapper to inherit proper permissions rather than executing applications directly.
