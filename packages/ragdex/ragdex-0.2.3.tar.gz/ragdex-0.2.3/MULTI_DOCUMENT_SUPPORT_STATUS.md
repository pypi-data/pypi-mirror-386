## Impact on Existing Library

### Documents Ready for Indexing
With the new dependencies installed, the following previously failed documents can now be indexed:

- **30 Word documents** (.doc files) - Previously failed due to missing LibreOffice
- **6 EPUB books** - Previously failed due to missing pypandoc
- **Total: 36 documents** ready for re-indexing

### Current Library Status
- Total Word documents found: 144 (54 .doc + 90 .docx)
- Total EPUB books found: 6+
- These can be indexed by running: `./scripts/run.sh`

## Next Steps

1. **Re-index failed documents**: The 36 previously failed documents will be automatically indexed on the next server run

2. **Monitor indexing progress**: Use the web monitor to track progress
   ```bash
   python -m personal_doc_library.monitoring.monitor_web_enhanced
   ```

3. **Verify in Claude**: After indexing, test the new documents in Claude by asking about content from Word documents or EPUB books

## Technical Notes

- Document type detection is automatic based on file extension
- All document types are processed into the same vector store
- Search works seamlessly across all document types
- The `document_type` metadata field identifies the source format

## Updated Files
- `README.md`: Added installation instructions for Word and EPUB support
- `serviceInstall.sh`: Added automatic dependency installation
- `CLAUDE.md`: Updated status to reflect multi-document support
- `src/personal_doc_library/core/shared_rag.py`: Already supports multiple document types

The system is now fully operational with comprehensive document format support!
