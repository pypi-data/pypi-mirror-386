class  AbstractExecutor(ABC):
    """
    AbstractExecutor is an abstract base class for evaluating the fitness of test scenarios.
    
    Attributes:
        results_path (str): Path to store simulation results. If provided, the directory is created if it does not exist.
        test_dict (dict): Dictionary storing information about each executed test, including test data, fitness, info, and timestamp.
        generator (AbstractGenerator): Generator object responsible for converting genotypes to phenotypes and validating tests.
        _name (str): Name identifier for the executor.
        min_fitness (float): Minimum fitness threshold for test evaluation.
        exec_counter (int): Counter tracking the number of executed tests.
    
    Methods:
        __init__(generator, results_path=None, min_fitness=0.0):
            Initializes the AbstractExecutor with the given generator, results path, and minimum fitness.
        execute_test(test) -> Tuple[float, str]:
            Executes a test scenario, evaluates its fitness, and returns the fitness score and additional information.
            Handles test validity, execution timing, and error logging.
        _execute(test) -> float:
            Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses, defining how a test is executed and its fitness is computed.
            This method should be implemented for a specific system under test.
        name -> int:
            Property returning the name identifier of the executor.

        Notes:
            - Converts the genotype to phenotype using the generator.
            - Validates the test before execution; if invalid, returns a fitness of 0.
            - If an exception occurs during execution, logs the error and updates the test info accordingly.
