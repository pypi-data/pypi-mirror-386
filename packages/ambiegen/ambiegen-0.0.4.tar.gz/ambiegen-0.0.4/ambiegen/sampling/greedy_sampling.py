    """
    GreedySampling implements a sampling strategy that selects the best candidate out of k randomly generated tests based on their fitness, using a greedy approach.
    
    Arguments:
        generator (AbstractGenerator): An object capable of generating random tests and converting genotypes to phenotypes.
        greedy_executor (AbstractExecutor): An object capable of evaluating the fitness of a phenotype.
    
    Methods:
        _do(problem, n_samples, **kwargs): Generates `n_samples` test cases by repeatedly selecting the best out of k randomly generated candidates.
        _select_best_of_k(k): Generates k random test cases and selects the one with the best (lowest) fitness value.
