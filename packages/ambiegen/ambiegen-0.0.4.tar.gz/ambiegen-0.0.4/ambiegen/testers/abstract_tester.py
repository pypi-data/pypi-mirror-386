class AbstractTester(abc.ABC):
    '''
    Abstract base class for test generation and execution workflows.
    This class defines the interface for creating test generators, executors, and search algorithms,
    as well as running optimization processes for automated testing. Subclasses must implement the
    abstract methods to provide concrete functionality for initializing test generators, executors,
    search algorithms, and running the optimization process.
    
    Arguments:
        _name (str): Name of the test generator instance.
        config (Any): Configuration file or object for the test generator.
    
    Methods:
        initialize_test_generator():
            Main purpose of this method is to generate random tests. Must be implemented by subclasses.
        initialize_test_executors():
            This method should launch and evalute the target system or function. Must be implemented by subclasses.
        set_up_search_algorithm():
            Abstract method to set up the search algorithm. Must be implemented by subclasses.
        run_optimization():
            Abstract method to run the optimization process. Must be implemented by subclasses.
        start():
            Orchestrates the initialization and execution of the test generation and optimization
            process by calling the respective methods in sequence.
