## About

ROIExtractors provides a common API for various optical imaging and segmentation formats to streamline conversion and data analysis. ROI stands for Region Of Interest, which is the region in a set of acquired fluorescence images which the segmentation software has determined as a neuron.

Features:

* Reads data from 10+ popular optical imaging and segmentation data formats into a common API.
* Extracts relevant metadata from each format.
* Provides a handy set of methods to analyze data such as `get_roi_locations()`

## Installation

To install the latest stable release of **roiextractors** though PyPI, type:
```shell
pip install roiextractors
```

For more flexibility we recommend installing the latest version directly from GitHub. The following commands create an environment with all the required dependencies and the latest updates:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/catalystneuro/roiextractors
cd roiextractors
conda env create roiextractors_env
conda activate roiextractors_env
pip install -e .
```
Note that this will install the package in [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#editable-installs).

Finally, if you prefer to avoid `conda` altogether, the following commands provide a clean installation within the current environment:
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/catalystneuro/roiextractors.git@main
```

## Documentation
See our [ReadTheDocs page](https://roiextractors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for full documentation, including a gallery of all supported formats.

## Funding
ROIExtractors is funded by
