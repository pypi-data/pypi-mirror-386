"""
Provides development utilities.
Each utility attempts to be almost entirely standalone (although there is
a small amount of cross-talk within the packages).
In order of usefulness, the design is:
1. `Logging` provides a flexible logging interface where the log data can be
    reparsed and loggers can be passed around
2. `Serializers`/`Checkpointing` provides interfaces for writing/loading data
    to file and allows for easy checkpoint loading
3. `Jobs` provides simpler interfaces for running jobs using the existing utilities
4. `CLIs` provides simple command line interface helpers
