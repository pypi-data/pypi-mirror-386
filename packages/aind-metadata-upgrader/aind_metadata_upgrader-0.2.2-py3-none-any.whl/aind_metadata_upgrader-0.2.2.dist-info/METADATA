## I want to run the upgrader

```python
from aind_metadata_upgrader.upgrade import Upgrade

# <Your code here: load your data as a dictionary, e.g. json.load(f)>

upgraded_record = Upgrade(data)
upgraded_record.save()
```

## I want to develop new upgraders

Add a new `CoreUpgrader` class, then include it in the `MAPPINGS` object.

## I want to run the upgrader in sync mode, i.e. to upgrade all assets to DocDB

```python
from aind_metadata_upgrader.sync import run
run()
```
