# AgenticFleet Frontend

React-based frontend for AgenticFleet multi-agent system with real-time SSE streaming and Human-in-the-Loop approval workflow.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### With Backend

From the project root, run both services at once:

```bash
./scripts/start-with-frontend.sh
```

This starts:

- Backend on `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:8080`

### Frontend Only

```bash
cd src/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

> **Note:** The frontend expects the backend to be running on `http://localhost:8000`. Vite proxy is configured to forward API requests.
