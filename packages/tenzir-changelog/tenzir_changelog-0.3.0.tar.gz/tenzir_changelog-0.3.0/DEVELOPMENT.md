# Development Guide

This document outlines day-to-day workflows for contributors to
`tenzir-changelog`. You need Python 3.12+ and
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to get started.

## Setup

Install dependencies into the managed virtual environment:

```sh
uv sync --python 3.12
```

This creates `.venv/` containing runtime dependencies and the local tooling
stack.

## Using the Project Interpreter

Run commands inside the managed environment with `uv run`. For an interactive
shell:

```sh
uv run python
```

## Common Tasks

- Format & lint:
  ```sh
  uv run ruff format
  uv run ruff check
  ```
- Run the test suite:
  ```sh
  uv run pytest
  ```
- Type-check:
  ```sh
  uv run mypy
  ```
- Build distributions:
  ```sh
  uv build
  ```

- Aggregate quality gate:
  ```sh
  uv run check-release
  ```

## Changelog Workflow

We maintain this repository's changelog with the local CLI project in
`changelog/`. Always invoke the tool through `uv run` so it picks up the managed
environment:

```sh
uv run tenzir-changelog --root changelog --help
```

Add an entry for every notable change (files land in `changelog/unreleased/`):

```sh
uv run tenzir-changelog --root changelog add --title "Describe the change"
```

The CLI issues sequential filenames like `01-describe-the-change.md`, widening
automatically after entry 99 so entries always sort chronologically by their
numeric prefix.

Use `release create` when drafting release manifests. The command writes the
release notes to `releases/<version>/README.md`, moves all unreleased entries
into that directory, and leaves `unreleased/` ready for the next cycle. Run
`validate` to check the project before submitting a pull request:

```sh
uv run tenzir-changelog --root changelog validate
```

## Quality Gates

Before opening a pull request, ensure the combined workflow passes:

```sh
uv run check-release
```

The helper sequentially runs the formatter (diff-only), lint, type checks, the
test suite, and a distribution build. To run steps individually:

```sh
uv run ruff format --check
uv run ruff check
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
uv build
```

## Releasing

Releases use trusted publishing from GitHub Actions. When ready:

1. Confirm the tree is clean and checks pass:
   ```sh
   uv run check-release
   ```
2. Draft the release manifest and move unreleased entries:
   ```sh
   uv run tenzir-changelog --root changelog release create vX.Y.Z --description "Summary" --compact --yes
   uv run tenzir-changelog --root changelog validate
   ```
   You can provide additional context via `--intro-file` instead of editing files
   manually. The command relocates the contents of `changelog/unreleased/` into
   `changelog/releases/vX.Y.Z/entries/`, records release metadata in
   `manifest.yaml`, and renders human-friendly notes in `README.md`.
3. Bump the version:
   ```sh
   uv version --bump <part>
   ```
4. Commit changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -am "Bump version to vX.Y.Z"
   ```
5. Tag and push:
   ```sh
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git push && git push --tags
   ```
6. Draft and publish a GitHub release describing highlights.

Publishing the release triggers the automated workflow that builds, validates,
and uploads artifacts to PyPI before smoke-testing the package.

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused and reference related issues when possible.
- Update documentation and examples when behavior changes.
- Ensure continuous integration is green before requesting review.
