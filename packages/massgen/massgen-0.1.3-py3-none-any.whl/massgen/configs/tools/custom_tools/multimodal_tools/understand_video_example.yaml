# MassGen Configuration: Understand Video Example
#
# Use Case: Analyze a specific video file using the understand_video tool
#
# This demonstrates direct video analysis without needing to download.
# The video file is provided as a context path for agents to analyze.
#
# Run with:
#   uv run massgen --config massgen/configs/tools/custom_tools/multimodal_tools/understand_video_example.yaml "What is shown in this video?"

# What happens:
# 1. Agents have read access to the video file
# 2. They can use understand_video tool to analyze it
# 3. Tool extracts 8 frames and analyzes with GPT-4.1
# 4. Agents collaborate to provide comprehensive insights
