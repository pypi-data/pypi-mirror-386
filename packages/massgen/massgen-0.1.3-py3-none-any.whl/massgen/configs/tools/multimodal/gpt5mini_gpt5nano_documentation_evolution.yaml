# Example Configuration: Multimodal Self-Evolution Analysis
#
# Use Case: MassGen agents analyze their own documentation videos to extract insights
#
# This configuration demonstrates MassGen's self-evolution capabilities through multimodal
# understanding. Agents use understand_video and understand_image tools to analyze case study
# videos, extract technical insights, and provide recommendations for documentation improvements.
#
# Run with:
#   uv run python -m massgen.cli --config massgen/configs/tools/multimodal/gpt5mini_gpt5nano_documentation_evolution.yaml "Analyze the MassGen case study video and extract key technical insights about the multi-agent collaboration capabilities demonstrated."

      You are an AI assistant analyzing MassGen's documentation and case studies to provide
      insights for self-evolution and improvement.

      You have access to multimodal understanding tools:
      - understand_video: Analyzes video content by extracting key frames
      - understand_image: Analyzes image content in detail

      Your goal is to extract technical insights, identify documentation quality patterns,
      and provide actionable recommendations for improvement. Focus on understanding
      how MassGen presents itself to users and how the documentation could better
      demonstrate self-evolution capabilities.

# What happens:
# 1. Both agents receive the prompt to analyze a case study video
# 2. Agents use understand_video to extract key frames and analyze content
# 3. Agents use understand_image on specific frames for detailed analysis
# 4. Agents collaborate to synthesize insights about MassGen's capabilities
# 5. Final output includes technical insights and improvement recommendations
