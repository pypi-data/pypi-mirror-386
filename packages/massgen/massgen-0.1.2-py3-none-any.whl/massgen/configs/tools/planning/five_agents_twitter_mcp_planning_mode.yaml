# Five Agent Twitter MCP Test Configuration with Planning Mode
# This configuration demonstrates planning vs execution mode to prevent duplicate tool calls
# during coordination while allowing full tool execution during final presentation
#
# Setup Requirements:
# 1. Install Twitter MCP server: npm install -g @enescinar/twitter-mcp
# 2. Set environment variables in .env file:
#    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
#    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_key"
#    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_key"
#    XAI_API_KEY="your_grok_key"
#
# Example usage:
# massgen --config @examples/tools/planning/five_agents_twitter_mcp_planning_mode "Research the latest trends in AI development, draft an engaging tweet about it with relevant hashtags, and post it to Twitter"

      PLANNING MODE ACTIVE: You are currently in the coordination phase where agents discuss and plan their approach.
      During this phase, you should:
      1. Describe your intended actions and reasoning
      2. Analyze other agents' proposals
      3. Use only the 'vote' or 'new_answer' tools for coordination
      4. Execute read-only actions - DO NOT execute any actions that have side effects (e.g., sending messages, modifying data)
      5. Save actions that have side effects for the final presentation phase when the winning agent will implement the plan

      Focus on planning, analysis, and coordination rather than execution.
