# Command Execution with Additional Blacklist Filtering
# Blocks commands beyond the default safety checks
# Run with: uv run python -m massgen.cli --config massgen/configs/debug/code_execution/command_filtering_blacklist.yaml "Write and test a sorting algorithm in Python"
# Expected behavior: Agent cannot run Python commands or install packages, so will fail to complete the task and end or timeout.
# Note this is a test; we would never ask for the conflicting task in practice.
