# Docker Isolation Verification Config
# Run with: uv run python -m massgen.cli --config massgen/configs/debug/code_execution/docker_verification.yaml "Run these commands and save output to verification.txt: 1) hostname, 2) cat /etc/hostname, 3) whoami, 4) cat /proc/1/cgroup | head -5, 5) ls -la /. Then install numpy and pandas packages. Create a Python script that imports these packages and prints their versions and installation locations."

# Expected behavior: Output proves execution is in Docker container (different hostname, container user, docker cgroups). Packages install in container, not on host.
# The hostname should show a container ID (not your host), whoami should show 'massgen', and /proc/1/cgroup should show docker paths - this proves we're in a container!"
# Verification: Check verification.txt - hostname should be a hex ID like 'a1b2c3d4e5f6', NOT your computer's hostname
# Prerequisites: Docker installed and running, massgen/mcp-runtime:latest image built (run massgen/docker/build.sh)
