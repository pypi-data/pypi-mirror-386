# Two Agent Orchestration Restart Test Configuration (No Filesystem)
# This configuration demonstrates the orchestration restart feature for self-correcting coordination
# Uses debug_final_answer to force restart on first attempt for testing
#
# Setup Requirements:
# 1. Set environment variable in .env file:
#    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
#
# Example usage:
# massgen --config @examples/configs/debug/restart_test_controlled.yaml "Describe two famous Beatles members: John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Include their birth year, role in the band, and notable contributions."
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Attempt 1: Agents coordinate, final presentation shows debug override (incomplete answer)
# - Post-evaluation detects incomplete answer and calls restart_orchestration()
# - Restart banner displays with reason and instructions
# - Attempt 2: Agents see restart context and produce complete answer
# - Post-evaluation approves and calls submit()
# - Inspection menu appears

    John Lennon was born in 1940 in Liverpool, England. He was a founding member
    of The Beatles and served as rhythm guitarist and vocalist. He co-wrote many
    of the band's greatest hits with Paul McCartney. After the Beatles disbanded,
    he pursued a successful solo career and became known for his peace activism.
