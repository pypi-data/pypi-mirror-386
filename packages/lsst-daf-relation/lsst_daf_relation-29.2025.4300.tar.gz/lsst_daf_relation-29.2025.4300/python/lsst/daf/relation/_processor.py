class Processor(ABC):
    """An inheritable framework for processing multi-engine relation trees.

    Individual `Engine` classes have different definitions of what it means to
    process a relation tree, and no single engine can handle a tree with
    engines.  This class provides a recursive algorithm that fills that role,
    with abstract method hooks for implementing `Transfer` and `Materialize`
    operations.

    Notes
    -----
    The `Processor` algorithm walks the tree recursively until it either finds:

    - a `Relation` with a `Relation.payload` that is not `None`, which is
      returned as-is;

    - a `Materialization` operation, for which a payload is computed via a call
      to the `materialize` hook, and then attached to both the original
      relation (modifying it in-place) and the returned one;

    - a `Transfer` operation, for which a payload is computed via a call to
      the `transfer` hook, and then the attached to the returned relation only.

    In addition, `Processor` never calls either hook on
    `trivial <Relation.is_trivial>` methods -
    `Engine.get_join_identity_payload` and `Engine.get_doomed_payload` are
    called instead.  This can (for example) avoid executing asking a database
    to execute a SQL query when the relation tree knows in advance the result
    will have no real content.  It also special-cases `Transfer` operations
    that are followed immediately by a `Materialization`, allowing both
    operations to be handled by a single call.

        Parameters
        ----------
        relation : `Relation`
            Root of the relation tree to process.  On return, relations that
            hold a `Materialization` relation will have a new
            `~Relation.payload` attached, if they did not have one already.

        -------
        processed : `Relation`
            A version of the relation tree in which any relation with a
            `Transfer` operation has a copy of the original `Transfer` that
            has a `~Relation.payload` attached.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source : `Relation`
            Relation to be transferred.  Any upstream `Transfer` operations in
            this tree are guaranteed to already have a `~Relation.payload`
            already attached (or some intervening relation does), so the

            own.
        destination : `Engine`
            Engine the relation is being transferred to.
        materialize_as : `str` or `None`
            If not `None`, the name of a `Materialization` operation that
