# DocVault Memory System Setup

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**External ID:** `doc_vault_dev`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Successfully created 8 active memories for the DocVault project using agent-mem MCP. These memories provide essential context throughout development without overwhelming the AI with unnecessary details.

## Active Memories

### 1. Project Overview (ID: 19)
**Purpose:** High-level project context

**Sections:**
- `purpose` - What DocVault is and why it exists
- `core_features` - v1.0 features and Phase 2 roadmap
- `tech_stack` - Core technologies and dev tools
- `timeline` - 20-day implementation schedule

### 2. Architecture Design (ID: 20)
**Purpose:** Technical structure and patterns

**Sections:**
- `layers` - Three-layer architecture (SDK → Service → Repository → Storage)
- `component_responsibilities` - What each layer does
- `design_patterns` - Repository pattern, async-first, external ID pattern
- `storage_strategy` - MinIO bucket and path structure

### 3. Database Design (ID: 21)
**Purpose:** Schema and relationships

**Sections:**
- `tables` - organizations, agents, documents, document_versions, document_acl
- `relationships` - Foreign key relationships and cardinality
- `indexes` - Performance and full-text search indexes
- `triggers` - Auto-update triggers for timestamps and search vectors

### 4. API Design (ID: 22)
**Purpose:** SDK method signatures

**Sections:**
- `initialization` - How to create DocVaultSDK instances
- `document_operations` - upload, download, update, delete, search methods
- `access_control` - share, revoke, check_permission methods
- `version_management` - get_versions, restore_version methods

### 5. Configuration (ID: 23)
**Purpose:** Setup and dependencies

**Sections:**
- `environment_variables` - PostgreSQL, MinIO, DocVault env vars
- `dependencies` - Core and dev packages with versions
- `setup_steps` - How to set up development environment

### 6. Development Status (ID: 24)
**Purpose:** Track progress and blockers

**Sections:**
- `current_phase` - What phase we're in right now
- `completed_tasks` - Checkmarks for finished work
- `next_steps` - Immediate tasks to do
- `blockers` - Any impediments to progress

**Note:** This memory will be updated frequently throughout development.

### 7. Library References (ID: 25)
**Purpose:** How to use and find docs for libraries

**Sections:**
- `psqlpy_usage` - Key patterns, local reference, search strategy
- `minio_usage` - Key operations, search strategy
- `pydantic_usage` - Schemas, settings, search strategy
- `testing_tools` - pytest, pytest-asyncio, mocking

**Note:** Contains pointers to context-bridge MCP and local docs, not full documentation.

### 8. Issues and Bugs (ID: 26)
**Purpose:** Detailed bug tracking

**Sections:**
- `template_for_new_issues` - Format for reporting new bugs

**Note:** New sections will be added dynamically as bugs are discovered during development. Each bug gets its own section with ID format: `issue_{number}_{short_name}`.

## Memory Management Instructions

Comprehensive instructions have been created at:
```
.github/instructions/memory-management.instructions.md
```

This file defines:
- When to access memories (session start, before features, when stuck, when bugs found)
- How to update memories (examples for each common update pattern)
- Search best practices (good vs bad queries)
- Memory update frequency guidelines
- Integration with development workflow
- Quick reference commands
- Memory IDs reference table
- Important rules

## Usage Examples

### At Session Start
```python
mcp_agent-mem_get_active_memories(external_id="doc_vault_dev")
```

### Before Implementing a Feature
```python
mcp_agent-mem_search_memories(
    external_id="doc_vault_dev",
    query="Working on document upload, need database schema and storage path format",
    limit=10
)
```

### When Encountering a Bug
```python
mcp_agent-mem_update_memory_sections(
    external_id="doc_vault_dev",
    memory_id=26,
    sections=[{
        "section_id": "issue_001_psqlpy_ssl_error",
        "action": "replace",
        "new_content": "**Issue #001: PSQLPy SSL Connection Error**\n..."
    }]
)
```

### Updating Development Progress
```python
mcp_agent-mem_update_memory_sections(
    external_id="doc_vault_dev",
    memory_id=24,
    sections=[{
        "section_id": "current_phase",
        "action": "replace",
        "old_content": "**Phase: Pre-Implementation**...",
        "new_content": "**Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)**\n..."
    }]
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Contextual**: AI always has relevant project context without reading full plan
2. **Searchable**: Semantic search across all memories finds relevant info quickly
3. **Structured**: Consistent format makes information easy to find
4. **Evolving**: Memories update as project progresses
5. **Lightweight**: Only essential information, not overwhelming
6. **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects needed for development

## Next Steps

1. Review memory management instructions
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation
3. Update "Development Status" memory when starting Phase 1
4. Use search when needing specific context
5. Document bugs/issues as discovered
6. Update "Library References" with learnings

**Remember:** Always use `external_id="doc_vault_dev"` for all memory operations.
