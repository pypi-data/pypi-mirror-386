      message: >-
        A known keystone charm bug has been identified and is affecting this
        glance-simplestreams-sync unit whereby relation data received from
        keystone is missing keys 'internal_host' and 'internal_port'. Upgrading
        charm-keystone to version >= stable/539 should fix the problem.
