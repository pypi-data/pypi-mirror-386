      message: >-
        A known ceph-osd charm bug has been identified. The charm tried to zap
        a disk but failed since the disk has an LVM header. If you are sure the
        disk is not in active use by LVM you may run pvremove on it then
        'juju resolve {unit}' - see LP bug for details.
