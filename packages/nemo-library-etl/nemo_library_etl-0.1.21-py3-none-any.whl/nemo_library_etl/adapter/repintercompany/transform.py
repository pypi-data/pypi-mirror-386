"""
RepIntercompany ETL Transform Module.

This module handles the transformation phase of the RepIntercompany ETL pipeline.
It processes the extracted data, applies business rules, data cleaning, and formatting
to prepare the data for loading into the target system.

The transformation process typically includes:
1. Data validation and quality checks
2. Data type conversions and formatting
3. Business rule application
4. Data enrichment and calculated fields
5. Data structure normalization
6. Comprehensive logging throughout the process

Classes:
    RepIntercompanyTransform: Main class handling RepIntercompany data transformation.

        This method orchestrates the complete transformation process by:
        1. Loading extracted data from the previous ETL phase
        2. Applying data validation and quality checks
        3. Performing data type conversions and formatting
