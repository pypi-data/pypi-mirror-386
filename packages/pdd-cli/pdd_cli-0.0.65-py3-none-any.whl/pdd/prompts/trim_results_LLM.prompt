% You are an expert JSON editor. You are tasked with trimming potential overlap between a partially generated text and its continuation. This is crucial for seamlessly combining text segments without duplication.

% You will be given two pieces of text that will be appended together afterwards to form a coherent whole:
<inputs>
    1) This is the text that has been generated so far:
    <generated_results>
    {GENERATED_RESULTS}
    </generated_results>

    2) This is the continuation of the generation:
    <continued_generation>
    {CONTINUED_GENERATION}
    </continued_generation>
</inputs>

% Your task is to:
1. Compare the end of the generated_results with the beginning of the continued_generation.
2. Identify any overlapping text.
3. If overlap exists, trim it from the start of the continued_generation and be careful to keep or remove spaces so that the text makes sense.
4. If no overlap exists, leave the continued_generation as is.
5. Trim out the preamble text before the code block that starts with a triple backtick (```) including the triple backticks and language tag. Also, there might be a xml tag, 'llm_output', at the start or end of the continued_generation, which should be removed.

% After completing these steps, provide your output in JSON format with the following keys:
- explanation: A string explaining what was trimmed, if anything. If nothing was trimmed, explain why.
- trimmed_continued_generation: The trimmed continued_generation string. If no trimming was necessary, this should be identical to the original continued_generation.

% Ensure your JSON is properly formatted and contains only these two keys.

% Here are example of how your outputs should look like for given inputs:
<examples>
    <example1>
        <inputs>
            <generated_results>
            "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog and the "
            </generated_results>
            <continued_generation>
            """```text\n and the cat jumped over the lazy dog."""
            </continued_generation>
        </inputs>
        <output>
        {{
        "explanation": "Trimmed '```text\n and the ' from the start of the continued_generation as it overlapped with the end of generated_results and the triple backticks indicate a start of a code block.",
        "trimmed_continued_generation": "cat jumped over the lazy dog."
        }}
        </output>
    </example1>

    <example2>
        <inputs>
            <generated_results>
            ""
            </generated_results>
            <continued_generation>
            "Telling a short story. ```text\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
            </continued_generation>
        </inputs>
        <output>
        {{
        "explanation": "There was no overlap between the generated_results and the continued_generation. Trimmed preamble.","trimmed_continued_generation": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
        }}
        </output>
    </example2>

    <example3>
        <inputs>
            <generated_results>
            '''\n        input_strings, output_file_paths, language = construct_paths(\n            input_file_paths=input_'''
            </generated_results>
            <continued_generation>
            '''file_paths,\n            force=global_opts.force,\n            quiet=global_opts.quiet,\n            '''
            </continued_generation>
        </inputs>
        <output>
        {{
        "explanation": "'file_paths' is a continuation of 'input_' so there is no overlap between the generated_results and the continued_generation.",
        "trimmed_continued_generation": "file_paths,\n            force=global_opts.force,\n            quiet=global_opts.quiet,\n            "
        }}
        </output>
    </example3>
<examples>

% Remember to carefully compare the texts to ensure accurate trimming and provide a clear explanation of your actions so that the trimmed_continued_generation can be properly appended to generated_results without needed further edits.
