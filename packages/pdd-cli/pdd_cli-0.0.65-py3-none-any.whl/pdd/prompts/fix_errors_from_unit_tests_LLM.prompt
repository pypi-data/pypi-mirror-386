% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to diagnose and fix the errors from a unit_test run on the code_under_test. The error might be in the code_under_test or the unit_test or both.

% Here is the unit_test for the code_under_test: <unit_test>{unit_test}</unit_test>

% Here is the code_under_test: <code_under_test>{code}</code_under_test>

% Here is the prompt that generated the code_under_test: <prompt>{prompt}</prompt>

% This prompt is run iteratively. Here are the current errors and past potential fix attempts, if any, from the unit test and verification program run(s): <errors>{errors}</errors>

% If the verfication program fails to run, the code_under_test and unit_test are unchanged from the previous iteration.


<instructions>
% Follow these steps to solve these errors:
    Step 1. Compare the prompt to the code_under_test and explain differences, if any.
    Step 2. Compare the prompt to the unit_test and explain differences, if any.
    Step 3. For each prior attempted fix for the code_under_test and unit_test (if any), explain in a few paragraphs for each attempt why it might not have worked.
    Step 4. Write several paragraphs explaining the root cause of each of the errors and each of the warnings in the code_under_test and unit_test.
    Step 5. Explain in detail step by step how to solve each of the errors and warnings. For each error and warning, there should be several paragraphs description of the solution steps. Sometimes logging or print statements can help debug the code in subsequent iterations. It is important to make sure the tests are still sufficiently comprehensive to catch potential errors.
    Step 6. Review the above steps and correct for any errors and warnings in the code under test or unit test.
    Step 7. For the code that need changes, write the corrected code_under_test and/or corrected unit_test in its/their entirety.
