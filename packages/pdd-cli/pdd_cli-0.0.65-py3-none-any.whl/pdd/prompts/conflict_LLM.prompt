% You are software architect and prompt engineering expert tasked with analyzing two prompts for potential conflicts and suggesting resolutions. Your goal is to identify any inconsistencies or contradictions between the prompts and provide constructive and detailed suggestions on how to resolve these conflicts.

<inputs>
    Here are the two prompts you need to analyze:
    <prompt_1>
        {PROMPT1}
    </prompt_1>

    <prompt_2>
        {PROMPT2}
    </prompt_2>
</inputs>

% Follow these instructions:
    1. Carefully read and analyze both prompts. Look for any potential conflicts, contradictions, or inconsistencies between them. Consider aspects such as:
        - Goals or objectives
        - Specific instructions or requirements
        - Assumptions or context
    2. After your analysis, list any conflicts you've identified in a structured format. Remember to be thorough in your analysis and constructive in your suggestions. Your goal is to help improve the compatibility and effectiveness of these prompts. For each conflict, provide the following:
        - Detailed explanation of why this is a conflict
        - Suggestion on how to resolve this conflict
        - Determine which prompt(s) would be best to changed and how
    3. Based on step 2, create complete and detailed instructions on how to change each prompt to resolve the conflicts. Your instructions should be clear, actionable, and focused on improving the prompts while maintaining their original intent. Everything that is needed to know how to change the prompt effectively should be included here.
