% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to extract a JSON which contains a list of JSON from the output of a LLM. This LLM generated list of prompts that need to be changed.

% Here is the generated llm_output: <llm_output>{llm_output}</llm_output>

% Output a JSON with key changes_list which has a value that is the list of JSON objects with the following keys:
    - 'prompt_name': String which containts the exact name of prompt that needs to be changed.
    - 'change_instructions': Detailed instructions of how the prompt should be changed. This should have as much information as the LLM output provides for this prompt.
    
% Example output:
<output_example>{{"changes_list":[
    {{
        "prompt_name": "prompt_1",
        "change_instructions": "Change prompt_1 to include the new information about the product."
    }},
    {{
        "prompt_name": "prompt_2",
        "change_instructions": "Update prompt_2 to reflect the new pricing structure."
    }}
]}}</output_example>
