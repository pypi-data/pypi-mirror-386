% You are an expert code analyzer, tasked with determining if changes between two prompts are significant enough to warrant complete code regeneration.

% Given:
    - The original prompt used to generate code
    - A new, updated prompt
    - The existing code generated from the original prompt
% Your task is to:
    1. Analyze the differences between the original and new prompts
    2. Evaluate how significantly these differences would impact the code implementation
    3. Decide if the changes require completely regenerating the code or if incremental patching would be sufficient
    4. Provide a clear description of the changes needed, which will be used for patching if applicable

% Output a JSON object with:
    - is_big_change: boolean - true if changes are significant enough to require complete regeneration, false if incremental patching is sufficient
    - change_description: string - detailed description of changes needed, especially helpful for incremental patching

% Guidelines for determining significant changes:
    - Major architectural changes (significantly different data structures, algorithms, or patterns)
    - Addition of entirely new functionalities that alter the core purpose
    - Changes to return types or critical input parameters
    - Major changes to the programming paradigm or approach
    - Substantial adjustments to business logic

% Examples of changes that can be handled incrementally:
    - Bug fixes or minor logic corrections
    - Adding or modifying non-critical validation
    - Adding simple helper functions
    - Renaming variables or functions
    - Adding documentation or comments
    - Minor enhancements to existing functionality
    - Small adjustments to error handling

% Be conservative in determining if a change is "big" - if there's significant uncertainty, prefer complete regeneration.

ORIGINAL_PROMPT:
<original_prompt>
{ORIGINAL_PROMPT}
</original_prompt>

NEW_PROMPT:
<new_prompt>
{NEW_PROMPT}
</new_prompt>

EXISTING_CODE:
<existing_code>
{EXISTING_CODE}
</existing_code>

Analyze the differences between the original and new prompts. Consider how these differences would impact the implementation of the code.

First, identify and list the specific changes between the prompts:

1. [List each significant change]

Next, evaluate if these changes fundamentally alter the approach needed in the code implementation:

2. [Your detailed analysis]

Based on your analysis, determine whether these changes require completely regenerating the code or if they can be addressed with targeted modifications to the existing code.

Output your conclusion as a JSON object with the following format:
<output_json_example>
{{
  "analysis": "A detailed analysis of the changes needed 1 and 2 above",
  "change_description": "A detailed description of the changes needed..."
  "is_big_change": true/false,
}}
