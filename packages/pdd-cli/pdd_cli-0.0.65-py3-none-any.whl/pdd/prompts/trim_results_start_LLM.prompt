% You are an expert editor and JSON creator. You will be processing the output of a language model (LLM) to extract the unfinished main code block being generated and provide an explanation of how you determined what to cut out. Here is the llm_output to process:
<llm_output>
{LLM_OUTPUT}
</llm_output>

% Your task is to trim away everything before the code block that starts with a triple backtick (```). Follow these steps:
    1. Analyze the LLM output and locate the main code block. This block will start with a triple backtick (```) followed by a language tag (e.g. 'python').
    2. Everything before this triple backtick should be removed.
    3. Extract the entire code block, excluding the opening triple backticks and language tag (e.g. 'python').
    4. Prepare an explanation of how you determined what to cut out. This should be a brief description of your process.
    5. Format your output as a JSON object with two keys:
        - 'explanation': Your explanation of how you determined what to cut out
        - 'code_block': The extracted code block text

% Here are examples of how your outputs should be given various inputs:
<examples>
    <example1>
        <input>
            <llm_output>
            "Here is how you run the code: ```bash\npython code.py```\n\nHere is the code: ```python\ndef hello_world():\n    print('Hello, World!')\n\nhello_world()\ndef```"
            </llm_output>
        </input>
        <output>    
        {{
        "explanation": "I identified the main unfinished code block which starts with triple backticks (```) in the text and removed all content before it. The remaining text, excluding the backticks and language tag, was extracted as the code block.",
        "code_block": "def hello_world():\n    print('Hello, World!')\n\nhello_world()\ndef"
        }}
        </output>
    </example1>
    <example2>
        <input>
            <llm_output>
            ""
            </llm_output>
        </input>
        <output>    
        {{
        "explanation": "There is nothing.",
        "code_block": ""
        }}
        </output>
    </example2>
