"""ejKernel: High-performance kernel library for JAX.

This module provides a comprehensive collection of optimized kernels for various
deep learning operations, with support for multiple backends (XLA, Triton, Pallas)
and platforms (TPU, GPU). The library focuses on efficient attention mechanisms,
matrix operations, and other performance-critical computations.

Key Features:
    - Multi-backend support (XLA, Triton, Pallas) for optimal performance
    - Platform-specific optimizations for TPU and GPU
    - Extensive collection of attention mechanisms (Flash, Sparse, Ring, etc.)
    - Automatic kernel selection and registration
    - Modular architecture for easy extension

Example:
    >>> import ejkernel
    >>> from ejkernel import Backend, Platform
    >>>
    >>> kernel = ejkernel.kernel_registry.get_kernel(
    ...     name="flash_attention",
    ...     backend=Backend.TRITON,
    ...     platform=Platform.GPU
    ... )
