"""Utility functions and helpers for ejkernel.ops.

This module provides various utilities for device fingerprinting, serialization,
metadata extraction, and other supporting functionality.

Functions:

    device_fingerprint: Generate stable device identifier
    device_kind: Get device type (gpu, cpu, tpu)
    sharding_fingerprint: Extract sharding information from arrays
    abstractify: Convert arrays to shape/dtype specs for hashing
    stable_json: Deterministic JSON serialization
    short_hash: Generate short hash from object


    extract_labels_from_hlo_text: Find operation labels in HLO text
    find_labels_in_lowered: Extract labels from lowered JAX computation
    label: Generate operation label
    labels_to_configs: Map labels to configurations


    to_json: Serialize object to JSON string
    from_json: Deserialize object from JSON string
