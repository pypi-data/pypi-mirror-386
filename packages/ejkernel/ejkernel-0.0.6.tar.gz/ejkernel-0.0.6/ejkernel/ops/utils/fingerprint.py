"""Device fingerprinting and object hashing utilities for caching.

This module provides functions for generating stable, deterministic identifiers
for JAX devices, array shapes, and complex Python objects. These identifiers
are essential for the caching system to correctly match configurations across
different runs and environments.

Key Functions:
    device_fingerprint: Generate stable device identifiers
    short_hash: Create short hashes from complex objects
    stable_json: Deterministic JSON serialization
    abstractify: Convert arrays to abstract shape/dtype specs
    sharding_fingerprint: Extract sharding information for caching

The fingerprinting system handles:
    - JAX devices with platform version information
    - Complex nested data structures (PyTrees)
    - Functions and partial functions
    - Dataclasses and Pydantic models
    - JAX arrays with sharding information
    - NumPy arrays and dtypes

These utilities ensure that:
    - Cache keys are consistent across program runs
    - Device-specific optimizations are properly isolated
    - Complex objects can be reliably serialized and hashed
    - Sharding information is preserved for distributed computation

Example Usage:
    >>> device_id = device_fingerprint()
    >>> config_hash = short_hash(my_config)
    >>> abstract_tree = abstractify(data_with_arrays)
    >>> cache_key = default_key_builder_with_sharding(invocation)
