"""Type definitions for the ejkernel operations system.

This module defines the core type variables used throughout the operations
framework to provide type safety and generic programming support.

Type Variables:
    Cfg: Configuration type for kernel operations
        Represents the configuration parameter type for kernels.
        Can be any type (dict, dataclass, NamedTuple, etc.)

    Out: Output type for kernel operations
        Represents the return type of kernel operations.
        Can be any type (JAX arrays, tuples, complex structures)

These type variables enable:
    - Type-safe kernel implementations
    - Generic configuration handling
    - Clear documentation of input/output types
    - IDE support for type checking and autocompletion

Example Usage:
    >>> class MyKernel(Kernel[dict, jax.Array]):
    ...     def run(self, x: jax.Array, cfg: dict) -> jax.Array:
    ...         return x * cfg['multiplier']
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> kernel = MyKernel()
