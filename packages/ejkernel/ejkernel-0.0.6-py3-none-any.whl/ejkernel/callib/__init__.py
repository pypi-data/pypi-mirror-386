"""Calling library for Triton and JAX interoperability.

This module provides utilities for integrating Triton kernels with JAX,
including JIT compilation decorators, type conversions, and helper functions
for kernel development. It bridges the gap between Triton's GPU programming
model and JAX's functional array programming paradigm.

Key Components:
    - ejit: Enhanced JIT decorator for JAX functions
    - triton_call: Interface for calling Triton kernels from JAX
    - Type conversion utilities for Triton/JAX compatibility
    - Mathematical helper functions for kernel development
