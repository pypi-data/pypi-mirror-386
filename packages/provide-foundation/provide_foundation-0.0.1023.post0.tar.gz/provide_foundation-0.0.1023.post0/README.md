### Optional Dependencies

provide.foundation has optional feature sets that require additional dependencies:

| Feature | Install Command | Required For |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Basic logging** | `pip install provide-foundation` | Core logging functionality |
| **CLI framework** | `pip install provide-foundation[cli]` | Command-line interface features |
| **Cryptography** | `pip install provide-foundation[crypto]` | Hash functions, digital signatures, certificates |
| **HTTP Transport** | `pip install provide-foundation[transport]` | HTTP client utilities and transport features |
| **OpenTelemetry** | `pip install provide-foundation[opentelemetry]` | Distributed tracing and metrics |
| **All features** | `pip install provide-foundation[all]` | Everything above |

> **Quick Start Tip**: For immediate use with just logging, install the base package. Add extras as needed.

## What's Included

**provide.foundation** offers a comprehensive toolkit for building robust applications:

### Core Components

- **Structured Logging** - Beautiful, performant logging built on `structlog` with event-enriched structured logging and zero configuration required
- **Metrics** - Lightweight and extensible metrics collection with optional OpenTelemetry integration
- **CLI Framework** - Build command-line interfaces with automatic help generation and component registration (requires `[cli]` extra)
- **Configuration Management** - Flexible configuration system supporting environment variables, files, and runtime updates
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with retry logic and error boundaries
- **Resilience Patterns** - Suite of decorators for building reliable applications (retry, circuit breaker, bulkhead)
- **Concurrency Utilities** - High-level utilities for managing asynchronous tasks and thread-safe operations
- **Cryptographic Utilities** - Comprehensive cryptographic operations with modern algorithms and secure defaults (requires `[crypto]` extra)
- **File Operations** - Atomic file operations with format support and safety guarantees
- **Archive Operations** - Create and extract archives with support for TAR, ZIP, GZIP, and BZIP2 formats
- **Serialization** - Safe and consistent JSON serialization and deserialization
- **Console I/O** - Enhanced console input/output with color support, JSON mode, and interactive prompts
- **Formatting Utilities** - Collection of helpers for formatting text, numbers, and data structures
- **Platform Utilities** - Cross-platform detection and system information gathering
- **Process Execution** - Safe subprocess execution with streaming and async support
- **Hub and Registry** - Central system for managing application components, commands, and resources

## Architecture & Design Philosophy

provide.foundation is intentionally designed as a **foundation layer**, not a full-stack framework. Understanding our architectural decisions helps teams evaluate whether the library aligns with their requirements.

### When to Use provide.foundation

**Excellent fit:**
- CLI applications and developer tools
- Microservices with structured logging needs
- Data processing pipelines
- Background task processors

**Good fit (with awareness):**
- Web APIs (use for logging, not HTTP server)
- Task processors (Celery, RQ)
- Libraries needing structured logging

**Consider alternatives:**
- Ultra-low latency systems (<100Î¼s requirements)
- Full-stack framework needs (use Django, Rails)
- Tool stack incompatibility (Pydantic-only, loguru-only projects)

### Key Design Decisions

**Tool Stack Philosophy**: Built on proven tools (attrs, structlog, click) with strong opinions for consistency. Trade-off: less flexibility, but cohesive and well-tested stack.

**Threading Model**: Registry uses `threading.RLock` (not `asyncio.Lock`). Negligible impact for typical use cases (CLI apps, initialization-time registration, read-heavy workloads). For high-throughput async web services (>10k req/sec) with runtime registration in hot paths, consider async-native alternatives.

**Global State Pattern**: Singletons (`get_hub()`, `logger`) for ergonomic APIs. Mitigation: `provide-testkit` provides `reset_foundation_setup_for_testing()` for clean test state.

**Intentional Scope**: Provides logging, configuration, CLI patterns. Does NOT provide web frameworks, databases, auth, or templates. Integrate with FastAPI/Flask/Django for web applications.
