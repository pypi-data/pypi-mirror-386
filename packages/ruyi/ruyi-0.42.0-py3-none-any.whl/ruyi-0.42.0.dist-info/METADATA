            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
            1. Definitions.
         
               "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
               and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
               "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

               "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
               transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
               not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
               and conversions to other media types.
         
               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
               to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
               submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
               communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
         
               To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
               boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
               replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
               the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
               comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
               file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
               same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
               identification within third-party archives.

🌍 English | [简体中文](./README.zh.md)

## ⬇️ Installation

`ruyi` is available in two forms: the PyPI package or the one-file binary
distribution. Performance of various `ruyi` operations will be better with the
PyPI installation, but the one-file distribution is a bit easier to set up
because one doesn't have to first configure a Python environment. Either way,
the feature set should be the same.

Detailed installation instructions are also available [at our documentation site](https://ruyisdk.org/en/docs/Package-Manager/installation).

### ✅ Recommended: Install from PyPI

This is the recommended way to install `ruyi` on your machine. In any Python
virtual environment, simply type:

```sh
pip install ruyi
```

Or the equivalent with any other Python package manager you prefer. After the
installation completes, the `ruyi` command will then show up in the Python
virtual environment's `bin` directory; if you have already activated the
environment, you may now start using `ruyi`.

### Alternative: Use the one-file distribution

You can get pre-built binaries of `ruyi` from [GitHub Releases][ghr] or
[the RuyiSDK mirror][mirror-iscas] for easier testing.
Rename the downloaded file to `ruyi`, make it executable,
put inside your `$PATH` and you're ready to go.

[ghr]: https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases
[mirror-iscas]: https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/tags/

### Platform compatibility notes

Because `ruyi` is written in platform-independent Python, you may be able to
install `ruyi` on any system with a Python package manager. However, you may
not be able to install binary packages from the official RuyiSDK Software Repository
if you are on a system not listed on
[RuyiSDK's platform support documentation][ruyisdk-plat-support-en]
([中文][ruyisdk-plat-support-zh]), due to the packages being only built for the
officially supported systems. You may be able to obtain community-provided
support from [the RuyiSDK developer community][ruyisdk-community] in such cases.

[ruyisdk-plat-support-en]: https://ruyisdk.org/en/docs/Other/platform-support/
[ruyisdk-plat-support-zh]: https://ruyisdk.org/docs/Other/platform-support/
[ruyisdk-community]: https://ruyisdk.cn/

## 🖥️ Usage

You can browse our documentation at [the dedicated RuyiSDK docs site][docs-en]
([中文][docs-zh]). In case you need any assistance, feel
free to search and post on [our community forum][ruyisdk-community].

[docs-en]: https://ruyisdk.org/en/docs/intro/
[docs-zh]: https://ruyisdk.org/docs/intro/

## ⚙️ Configuration

Various aspects of `ruyi` can be configured with files or environment variables.

### Config search path

`ruyi` respects `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` settings, and will
look up its config accordingly. If these are not explicitly set though, as in
typical use cases, the default config directory is most likely `~/.config/ruyi`.

GNU/Linux distribution packagers and system administrators will find that the
directories `/usr/share/ruyi` and `/usr/local/share/ruyi` are searched for the
config file on such systems.

### Config file

Currently `ruyi` will look for an optional `config.toml` in its XDG config
directory. The file, if present, looks like this, with all values being default:

```toml
[packages]
# Consider pre-release versions when matching packages in repositories.
prereleases = false

[repo]
# Path to the local RuyiSDK metadata repository. Must be absolute or the setting
# will be ignored.
# If unset or empty, $XDG_CACHE_HOME/ruyi/packages-index is used.
local = ""
# Remote location of RuyiSDK metadata repository.
# If unset or empty, this default value is used.
remote = "https://github.com/ruyisdk/packages-index.git"
# Name of the branch to use.
# If unset or empty, this default value is used.
branch = "main"

[telemetry]
# Whether to collect telemetry information for improving RuyiSDK's developer
# experience, and whether to send the data periodically to RuyiSDK team.
# Valid values are `local`, `off` and `on` -- see the documentation for
# details.
#
# If unset or empty, this default value is used: data will be collected and
# stored locally; nothing will be uploaded automatically.
mode = "local"
# The time the user's consent is given to telemetry data uploading. If the
# system time is later than the time given here, telemetry consent banner will
# not be displayed any more each time `ruyi` is executed. The exact consent
# time is also useful should the telemetry policy get updated in the future.
#
# To hide the consent banner, set it to the current local time, for example:
#
#     upload_consent = 2024-12-02T15:61:00+08:00
#
# The timestamp is intentionally invalid for you to notice and modify to your
# need.
upload_consent = ""
# Override the telemetry server URL of the RuyiSDK package manager scope.
# If unset, the repo-configured default is used; if set to empty, telemetry
# uploading is disabled.
#pm_telemetry_url = ""
```

### Environment variables

Currently the following environment variables are supported by `ruyi`:

* `RUYI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` -- boolean, whether to opt-out of telemetry.
* `RUYI_VENV` -- string, explicitly specifies the Ruyi virtual environment to use.

For boolean variables, the values `1`, `true`, `x`, `y` or `yes` (all case-insensitive)
are all treated as "true".

## 📞 Telemetry

The Ruyi package manager collects usage data in order to help us improve your
experience. It is collected by the RuyiSDK team and shared with the community.
You can opt-out of telemetry by setting the `RUYI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`
environment variable to any of `1`, `true`, `x`, `y` or `yes` using your
favorite shell. Opting out of telemetry is equivalent to the `off` mode
described below.

There are 3 telemetry modes available:

* `local`: data will be collected but not uploaded without user action.
* `off`: data will not be collected nor uploaded.
* `on`: data will be collected and periodically uploaded.

By default the `local` mode is active from `ruyi` 0.42.0 (inclusive) on, which
means every `ruyi` invocation will record some non-sensitive information locally
alongside various other states of `ruyi`, but collected data will not be
uploaded automatically unless you explicitly request so (for example by
switching to the `on` mode, or by executing `ruyi telemetry upload`).

In case the `on` mode is active, collected data will be periodically uploaded
to servers managed by the RuyiSDK team in the People's Republic of China, in a
weekly fashion. The upload will happen on a random weekday which is determined
by the installation's anonymous ID alone.

You can change the telemetry mode by editing `ruyi`'s config file, or simply
disable telemetry altogether by setting the `RUYI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment
variable to any of the values accepted as truthy.

We collect the following information with `ruyi`:

* the running machine's basic information:
    * architecture and OS
    * if architecture is RISC-V:
        * ISA capabilities
        * model name of the board
        * number of logical CPUs
    * OS release ID (roughly equals the distribution type)
    * type and version of libc
    * type of the shell (bash, fish, zsh, etc.)
* the version of `ruyi` on data upload time
* invocation patterns of various `ruyi` subcommands:
    * without exposing any parameters
