This is a simple example of how to use Arcade with CrewAI.
The example authenticates into the user's Gmail account, retrieves their 5 most recent emails, and summarizes them.

The example assumes the following:
1. You have an Arcade API key and have set the ARCADE_API_KEY environment variable.
2. You have an OpenAI API key and have set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.
3. You have installed the necessary dependencies in the requirements.txt file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
