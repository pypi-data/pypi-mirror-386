# Changelog

All notable changes to FuseSell Local will be documented in this file.

# [1.3.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Bundled prompt seeding now copies packaged defaults into fusesell_data/config automatically, guaranteeing the initial outreach stage always finds the shipped templates on first run.

### Changed
- Updated the default initial-outreach and follow-up prompts to require fully wrapped <html><body> content, enforce first-name greetings, and eliminate placeholder signatures so LLM drafts arrive production-ready.
- Sanitization logic normalizes generated emails into HTML (including fallback/mock drafts), injects recipient metadata, and reuses the calculated first name across prompt, rewrite, and reminder flows.
- Reminder scheduling now records Unix timestamps (cron_ts) for every new entry, simplifying downstream polling in RealTimeX orchestration.

### Fixed
- Draft generation once again prioritises the LLM prompt path; fallback templates only trigger when the prompt fails to load, preventing duplicate plain-text emails.
- Rewrites, dry-run mocks, and fallback drafts no longer emit duplicate greetings or unresolved [Your ...] placeholders, and they retain HTML formatting for downstream mailers.

# [1.2.9] - 2025-10-24

### Changed
- Primary sales rep metadata from gs_team_rep now flows into draft prompts, reminders, and signatures so outreach reflects the configured sender.
- Reminder scheduling stores the Unix timestamp (cron_ts) alongside the ISO string for easier downstream filtering.
- Greeting sanitizer standardises the first paragraph and removes duplicate salutations while keeping HTML formatting intact.

### Fixed
- Removed [Your ...] placeholder leftovers inside LLM responses and ensured drafts remain valid HTML even when the model mixes plain text and bullet lists.
- Reminder creation no longer fails when the data acquisition stage supplies the email address, and follow-up reminders inherit the same customer metadata.

# [1.2.8] - 2025-10-24

### Changed
- Initial outreach resolves the primary sales rep from `gs_team_rep` and injects their identity into prompts, reminders, and draft metadata so outreach reflects real team settings.

### Fixed
- Sanitizes generated email bodies to replace or remove `[Your …]` placeholders, ensuring signatures contain actual values even when optional rep fields are missing.
- Reminder scheduling now preserves merged contact emails so follow-up records always carry `customer_email` for downstream automations.

# [1.2.7] - 2025-10-24

### Changed
- RealTimeX sales-process normalization now forwards `recipient_address`, `recipient_name`, and `customer_email` into the FuseSell pipeline so prompt generation and scheduling have complete context.
- Default outreach prompt replacements enrich customer metadata with toolkit-derived contact details and enforce first-name greetings to match server quality.

### Fixed
- Initial outreach stage now records generated drafts in the pipeline summary, seeds reminder_task rows with toolkit credentials, and schedules follow-up events when `send_immediately` is false.
- Prompt-based draft generation no longer skips scheduling due to missing email fields and guarantees outputs without unresolved placeholders.

# [1.2.6] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Automatically seed packaged prompt, scoring, and template JSON files into the writable `ffusesell_data/config` directory so fresh installs immediately pick up the default initial outreach draft prompt.
- Draft generation now records the scheduled reminder metadata in stage output while mirroring the server’s `schedule_auto_run` behaviour locally.

### Fixed
- Bundled configuration files are used as a fallback when the data directory is missing overrides, preventing empty prompt loads that previously produced low-quality duplicate drafts.

# [1.2.5] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Local `reminder_task` table and scheduler plumbing so scheduled outreach mirrors the server flow and can be consumed by RealTimeX orchestration.
- Initial outreach and follow-up stages now emit reminder metadata whenever emails are scheduled, including team/customer context.

### Changed
- Event scheduler returns reminder IDs alongside scheduled events while preserving immutable default prompts when layering team overrides.

# [1.2.3] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- `LocalDataManager.search_products()` for server-compatible product filtering (status, keyword, limit, sort).
- CLI `product list` flags and `list_products.py` filters wired to the new search helper.
- Regression tests covering keyword search, sorting, and limiting behavior.

### Changed
- `get_products_by_org` now delegates to the filtered search path to avoid loading inactive results.
- Product management documentation updated for RealTimeX flows and CLI filter usage.

# [1.2.2] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- LocalDataManager regression tests covering product/team CRUD flows and sales process tracking helpers.

### Fixed
- Default team settings seeding now targets the `gs_team_*` columns, preventing initialization failures on fresh databases.

# [1.2.1] - 2025-10-21

### Changed
- Expose `__version__`, `__author__`, and `__description__` at the top-level `fusesell` module for easier runtime inspection.

### Fixed
- `import fusesell; fusesell.__version__` now reports the installed version instead of `unknown`.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- Packaged CLI access via `FuseSellCLI` export to support embedded runtimes and automated tests.
- pytest coverage (`fusesell_local/tests/test_cli.py`) ensuring the CLI dry-run path remains stable.

### Changed
- Distribution renamed to `fusesell` to align with upcoming PyPI publication; console entry point now resolves to `fusesell_local.cli:main`.
- CLI implementation moved into `fusesell_local/cli.py`, with top-level `fusesell.py` delegating for backward compatibility.
- Documentation refreshed to instruct `pip install fusesell` and demonstrate programmatic CLI reuse.
- Published version `1.2.0` to PyPI under the `fusesell` distribution name.

### Fixed
- Ensured package metadata includes the CLI module so installations via pip expose the `fusesell` console script.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- Library-first API (`fusesell_local.api`) exposing `build_config`, `execute_pipeline`, and supporting helpers for embedding FuseSell in external runtimes.
- Public exports in `fusesell_local.__init__` so consumers can import `FuseSellPipeline` and the new helpers directly.
- Programmatic configuration validation error (`ConfigValidationError`) for clearer failures in host applications.

### Changed
- CLI now delegates configuration/build/validation/logging to the shared library utilities, ensuring consistent behaviour across CLI and embedded usage.
- Pipeline context now forwards scheduling preferences (timezone, send_immediately, business hour fields) from configuration to stages.

### Fixed
- Continuation validation correctly requires `selected_draft_id` when performing `draft_rewrite` or `send` actions.
