Tools for extracting JWST NIRSpec MSA spectra directly from the telescope exposures

Under heavy construction....

.. note::
    Please submit any questions/comments/problems you have through the `Issues <https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp/issues>`_ interface.

The overall procedure is demonstrated in these notebooks:

- `drizzled-nirspec.ipynb <https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp/blob/main/docs/examples/drizzled-nirspec.ipynb>`_: Demo of new drizzling and combination code (`0.6.0`) with prism data from JWST program `GO-1433 <https://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/get-proposal-info?id=1433&observatory=JWST>`_ (PI: Dan Coe)
- `process-rxj2129.ipynb <https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp/blob/main/docs/examples/process-rxj2129.ipynb>`_: Demo with prism data from JWST program `DD-2767 <https://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/get-proposal-info?id=2756&observatory=JWST>`_ (PI: Pat Kelly)
- `process-smacs0723.ipynb <https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp/blob/main/docs/examples/process-smacs0723.ipynb>`_: Demo with medium resolution data from the JWST `ERO-2736 <https://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/get-proposal-info?id=2736&observatory=JWST>`_ program on the cluster SMACS-0723 (PI: Klaus Pontoppidon)

Run the RXJ2129 demo notebook directly on GitHub in a Codespace:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  #. Fork the repository from https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp
  
  #. Start a codespace from the repo: `"<> Code"` pulldown // `"Codespaces"` // `"+"`
  
  #. Wait for the initialization to complete, which sets up `msaexp` and its dependencies
  
  #. Navigate to the `docs/examples/` directory in the codespace
  
  #. Open `process-rxj2129.ipynb` and run it
  
  #. Commit to your forked repository any changes to the notebook itself or files created that you want to save outside the codespace
  
  #. Profit!
