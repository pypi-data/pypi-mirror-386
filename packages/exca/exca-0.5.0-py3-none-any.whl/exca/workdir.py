    Parameters
    ----------
    copied: Sequence[str]
        list/tuple of names of files, or folders, or packages installed in editable mode
        to copy to the new working directory folder.
        Relative paths will be moved to the relative equivalent in the new folder, while for
        absolute path, the folder/file pointed by the path will be moved directly to the new
        folder.
    folder: Path/str
        folder to use as working directory,
        if not specified, infra will create one automatically :code:`<infra_uid_folder>/code/<date>-<random_uid>/`.
        The folder is logged so you should be able to see what happened in your stderr/stdout.
        This parameter can be used in particular to store the code in a specific location
        or reuse workdir from a previous run.
    includes: sequence of str
        file name pattern than must be included (recursively)
        folder are always included except if explitely excluded
        eg: :code:`["*.py"]` to include only python files
    excludes: sequence of str
        file/folder name pattern than mush be excluded
    log_commit: bool
        if True, raises if current working directory is in a git repository
        with uncommited changes and logs commit otherwise

    Notes
    -----
    - Since python privileges current working directory over installed packages,
      the copied packages should be the one running in the job
      (be careful there can be a few gotchas, eg: for debug cluster or with no cluster,
      the import cannot be not reloaded so the current working directory will be used,
      but that should not make a difference in theses cases)
    - The change of working directory (and possibly the copy) only happens when the
      infra is called for submitting the decorated function. Depending on your code,
      this may not be at the very beginning of your execution.
    - The context is reentrant, upon the second entrance nothing will be updated.
