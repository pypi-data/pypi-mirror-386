class AsyncServiceConnector:
    """
    Asynchronous base class for robust service connection management with retry, backoff, and circuit breaker logic.

    This class is intended to be subclassed for managing persistent connections to external services
    (such as devices, databases, or remote APIs) that may be unreliable or temporarily unavailable.

    Features:
        - Automatic retry with configurable backoff and jitter strategies.
        - Circuit breaker to prevent repeated connection attempts after multiple failures.
        - Connection state tracking (disconnected, connecting, connected, circuit open).

    Usage:
        1. Subclass `AsyncServiceConnector` and override the `connect_to_service()` coroutine with your
           actual connection logic. Optionally, override `health_check()` for custom health verification.
        2. Store the actual connection object (e.g., socket, transport) as an instance attribute in your subclass.
        3. Use `attempt_connection()` to initiate connection attempts; it will handle retries and backoff automatically.
        4. Use `is_connected()` to check connection status.

    Example:
        class MyConnector(AsyncServiceConnector):
