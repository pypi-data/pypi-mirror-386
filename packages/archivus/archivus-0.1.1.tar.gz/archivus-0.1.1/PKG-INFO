# PROJECT IS NOT DONE, THIS IS JUST A RESERVED NAME. 

# 🧙‍♂️ Archivus

> A command-line and (optional) TUI tool for syncing **World of Warcraft** addons, profiles, and configurations — across characters, accounts, and even friends.

---

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project was conceptualized and partially written with help from **ChatGPT (GPT-5)**, serving as an assistant in ideation, naming, and boilerplate creation.  
All final design, logic, and implementation are written and maintained by **Eivind Teig**.

---

## ✨ Overview

**Archivus** is a modern Python-based tool that goes beyond ordinary addon managers.  
It doesn’t just download addons — it *archives* and *syncs* your complete World of Warcraft setup:

- 🧩 Addons  
- ⚙️ Configurations  
- 🧙 Character profiles  
- 🪄 Pre-made collections (for sharing with friends or new characters)

Perfect for players who want to quickly bootstrap a new character or share a fully configured interface with others.

---

## 🚀 Quick start

### 1. Install
```bash
pip install archivus
```

### 2. Basic usage
```
# Sync your current setup to your WoW Retail folder
archivus sync --to /path/to/World\ of\ Warcraft/_retail_

# Optional TUI mode
archivus tui
```

If you have both batgrl
 and Textual
 installed,
archivus tui will prefer batgrl automatically, falling back to textual if unavailable.
