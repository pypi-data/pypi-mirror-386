# Ariadne UX Improvement Validation Plan
## Focus: CLI Simplification & Documentation Consolidation

## Executive Summary

This validation plan provides a comprehensive framework for measuring the success of Ariadne's UX improvements, with immediate focus on CLI simplification and documentation consolidation. The plan leverages available GitHub analytics and user surveys to provide actionable insights for continuous improvement.

## 1. Current State Analysis

### 1.1 CLI Complexity Baseline
**Current CLI Structure (7 subcommands):**
- `simulate` - Primary circuit simulation
- `config` - Configuration management (create, validate, show)
- `status` - System health monitoring
- `benchmark` - Performance testing
- `benchmark-suite` - Comprehensive benchmarking
- `education` - Educational tools (demo, quiz, visualize)
- `learning` - Learning resources (list, info)

**Identified Issues:**
- Cognitive overload from 7 primary commands
- Education tools buried in subcommands
- Complex configuration management
- Inconsistent command naming (`education` vs `learning`)
