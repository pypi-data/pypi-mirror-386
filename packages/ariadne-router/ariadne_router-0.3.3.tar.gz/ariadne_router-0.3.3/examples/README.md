# Ariadne Examples

This directory contains a variety of examples to help you get started with Ariadne.

## How to Run the Examples

The examples are provided in two formats: Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) and Python scripts (`.py`).

### Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)

Jupyter Notebooks are the best way to interactively explore Ariadne's features.

1.  **Install Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

2.  **Start JupyterLab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

3.  **Navigate and Run:**
    From the JupyterLab interface, navigate to the `examples` directory and open any `.ipynb` file to view and run the cells.

### Python Scripts (`.py`)

The Python scripts are straightforward, non-interactive demonstrations of Ariadne's capabilities. You can run them directly from your terminal.

**For example, to run the quickstart demo:**
```bash
python examples/quickstart.py
```

Each script is self-contained and can be run individually.
