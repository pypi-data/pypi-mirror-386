# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest minor release. Please upgrade to the most recent version to receive fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
- Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories to privately report:
  1. Go to the repository Security tab â†’ "Report a vulnerability".
  2. Provide a minimal reproduction and environment details.
- If Security Advisories are unavailable for any reason, you may alternatively open a private issue with minimal details and request conversion to a security advisory.

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and keep you informed of the remediation timeline. After a fix is released, we will credit reporters who wish to be acknowledged.
