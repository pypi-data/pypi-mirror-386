# Naming Conventions

When in doubt, take time to name things well. It's one of the hardest problems in
computer science.

## Importance

- Names are a form of documentation that never goes out of date
- Good names reduce cognitive load and make code self-documenting
- Names should reveal intent and provide context
- Time spent on naming is an investment in future understanding

## When to Pause and Consider Naming Carefully

The more permanent/harder to change, the more time to spend on naming:

- Creating new models or database tables
- Defining core functions or classes
- Establishing API endpoints or URLs
- Naming background jobs or tasks
- Creating new features or components
- Defining key variables that appear throughout codebase

Notably, don't spend excessive time on naming for simple things that are easy to change.

## When Names Aren't Obvious

When a name for a new file, function, class, etc. isn't immediately obvious:

- Pause and ask what we should name it. It's better to ask than to guess and have to
  rename later.
- Consider multiple alternatives
- Evaluate options based on:
  - Clarity and intuitiveness
  - Technical accuracy
  - Future flexibility
  - Project context
