## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added

- **Sentry LLM Monitoring Support**: First-class integration with Sentry's AI
  Performance monitoring
  - `sentry_adapter.py` following Logfire pattern (native SDK config, OTEL API
    execution)
  - Automatic configuration via `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable
  - `gen_ai.*` attributes for Sentry's AI Monitoring dashboard
  - Full integration with Sentry's error tracking + LLM monitoring
  - Token usage tracking, cost analysis, and tool execution visibility
  - Comprehensive test suite with 91% coverage
  - Complete documentation in README with setup instructions

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Fixed CLI entry point to call `app()` instead of `main()`
  - v0.2.0 had a bug where all commands entered interactive mode
  - `--version`, `--print`, and other flags now work correctly
  - Issue only affected installed package (not `python -m` usage)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-15

### Changed

- **Major CLI Refactor**: Simplified argument parsing using Typer's variadic arguments
  - Reduced parsing logic from ~200+ lines to ~50 lines
  - Removed complex custom prompt extraction that was prone to bugs
  - Simple heuristic: last non-option argument is the prompt
  - Proper handling of `--flag=value`, `--flag value`, and `--flag` (boolean) formats
- Improved test suite with proper mocking following pytest standards
  - Added 20 new CLI parsing tests
  - Mock external dependencies instead of calling Claude CLI during tests
  - Faster test execution (0.30s for full suite)

### Fixed

- Fixed argument parsing bugs where flags were incorrectly treated as prompts
- Fixed test for KeyboardInterrupt handling to properly expect `typer.Exit`

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-XX

### Added

- Initial public release! ðŸŽ‰
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Claude agents
