class WorkerPool:

    """
    Manages a pool of worker jobs with support for job creation, reservation, and status updates.
    
    This class interfaces with MongoDB collections to coordinate job distribution and processing among workers. It supports atomic fetching and reservation of jobs, broadcasting jobs to multiple workers, and periodic status updates based on job dependencies and due dates.
    
    Key functionalities include:
    - Creating necessary MongoDB indexes for efficient querying.
    - Fetching and reserving direct and broadcast jobs for specific workers.
    - Fetching a batch of pending jobs filtered by user and computer identifiers.
    - Periodically updating job statuses from 'NEW' or 'WAITING' to 'PENDING' when due and dependencies are met.
    - Retrieving CPU model information in a cross-platform manner.
    
    All database operations are designed to be atomic to prevent job duplication or conflicts among workers.

            lock (threading.Lock): A lock to synchronize access to shared resources.
