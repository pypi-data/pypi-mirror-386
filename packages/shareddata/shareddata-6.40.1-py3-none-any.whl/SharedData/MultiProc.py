    Executes an I/O-bound function concurrently by distributing work across multiple processes, each managing a limited number of threads.
    
    This function partitions the input iterable into chunks and assigns each chunk to a separate process within a process pool. Each process runs the specified `thread_func` on its chunk using up to `maxthreads` threads to handle I/O-bound tasks efficiently. The number of worker processes is dynamically determined based on the CPU count, the size of the input iterable, and optional user-defined limits.
    
    Parameters:
        thread_func (callable): The function to execute concurrently on each chunk of data. It should accept the chunk, additional arguments, and the maximum number of threads.
        iterator (list or iterable): The collection of items to be processed.
        args (any): Additional arguments to pass to `thread_func`.
        maxproc (int, optional): Maximum number of processes to use. If None, no explicit limit is applied beyond CPU count and input size.

    Continuously processes tasks from an input queue using a specified function and places the results into an output queue until a termination signal is received.
    
    Args:
        thread_func (callable): A function that processes each task. It should accept two arguments: the task (iteration) and additional parameters (args).
        input_queue (queue.Queue): Queue from which tasks are retrieved. Receiving None indicates no more tasks and stops processing.
        output_queue (queue.Queue): Queue where processed results are placed.
        args (any): Additional arguments passed to thread_func for processing each task.
    
    The function runs in a loop, fetching tasks from input_queue, processing them with thread_func, and putting the results into output_queue. It terminates when a None value is encountered in input_queue.
