            Review this PR for code quality, security, and compatibility:

            **IMPORTANT: DO NOT run quality gates (formatting, linting, tests, type checking)**
            The CI pipeline already handles: Black, Ruff, mypy, Bandit, and pytest.
            Focus on code logic, architecture, and security only.

            **For hotfixes and minor fixes:**
            1. If code logic is sound and architecture is good, fix any issues directly
            2. Provide detailed analysis in comments
            3. Note if manual approval is recommended

            **For larger changes:**
            1. Provide comprehensive review feedback on logic and architecture
            2. Create issues for complex problems
            3. Suggest improvements and alternatives

            **Focus on:**
            - Code logic and correctness
            - Security vulnerabilities and best practices
            - Architecture decisions and design patterns
            - API compatibility and breaking changes
            - Algorithm efficiency and performance implications

            **Skip (CI handles these):**
            - Formatting checks (Black)
            - Linting (Ruff)
            - Type checking (mypy)
            - Security scanning (Bandit)
            - Test execution (pytest)
