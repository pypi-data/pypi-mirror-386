# Analysis for `tests/emitters/`

### `tests/emitters/test_client_emitter.py`

- **Overall**: This `pytest`-style suite contains a single test for the `ClientEmitter`. It focuses on verifying that the emitter generates a `client.py` file with some expected basic content when its `emit` method is called.
- **Test Naming and Structure**:
    - The test function is named `test_client_emitter_creates_core_files`.
        - *Observation*: The name mentions "core_files" (plural), but the test only checks for `client.py`. While `client.py` is a core part of the client, the name might be slightly broader than the test's scope if other core files were expected from `ClientEmitter` directly.
    - The docstring clearly states the purpose: "ClientEmitter should generate client.py with expected content."
    - Uses the `tmp_path` fixture for output.
- **Key Functionality Tested (`ClientEmitter.emit`)**:
    - **File Generation**: Checks that `client.py` is created in the specified output directory.
    - **Basic Content Verification**: Asserts the presence of key strings within the generated `client.py`:
        - `"class APIClient"`: Confirms the main client class definition.
        - `"HttpxTransport"`: Indicates the default transport is referenced.
        - `"def close"`: Checks for the presence of a close method.
- **Test Logic**:
    - A dummy `IRSpec` is created. The test notes that this spec is "not used by emitter", which implies that `ClientEmitter` might primarily generate static or template-based client scaffolding rather than spec-driven content for `client.py` itself (the spec would be more relevant for endpoint clients, models, etc., handled by other emitters which `ClientEmitter` might orchestrate or which are aggregated by the generated `APIClient`).
    - `ClientEmitter().emit()` is called.
    - The existence of `out_dir / "client.py"` is asserted.
    - The content of `client.py` is read and basic string checks are performed.
- **Clarity and Conciseness**:
    - The test is clear and concise for what it aims to verify.
    - The assertions are straightforward.
- **Alignment with `coding-conventions`**:
    - Good. The test has a clear G/W/T structure (Given: dummy spec and emitter, When: emit, Then: assert file existence and content snippets).
    - Docstring and name are informative.
- **Contradictory Expectations/Observations**:
    - Minor point: The test name `...creates_core_files` (plural) versus checking only `client.py`. If `ClientEmitter` is solely responsible for `client.py` and other "core" files (like auth, transport base classes) are handled differently (e.g., copied or generated by another mechanism not directly part of this `ClientEmitter`'s `emit` method for this specific test scope), then the test is fine, but the name could be more precise (e.g., `...creates_client_py_file`). If `ClientEmitter` *should* be creating other core files directly in this call, the test scope would need expansion.
- **Assumptions Based on Test**: The test implies that `ClientEmitter` generates a foundational `client.py` that likely includes the main `APIClient` class which would then aggregate or use other generated components (like endpoint-specific clients, models, and the core transport/auth mechanisms).

### `tests/emitters/test_docs_emitter.py`

- **Overall**: This `pytest`-style suite contains a single, comprehensive test for the `DocsEmitter`. It verifies that the emitter correctly generates an `index.md` file listing API tags and individual Markdown files for each tag, detailing the operations associated with that tag.
- **Test Naming and Structure**:
    - The test function is named `test_docs_emitter__emit_index_and_tag_files`.
    - The docstring clearly outlines the `Scenario` (render docs for a spec with two tags, one with special characters) and `Expected Outcome` (correct `index.md` with sanitized links, and per-tag `.md` files with operation sections).
    - Uses the `tmp_path` fixture for output.
    - Helper functions `create_simple_response_schema` and `create_simple_param_schema` are used to reduce boilerplate when creating dummy `IRSchema` objects for operations.
- **Key Functionality Tested (`DocsEmitter.emit`)**:
    - **`index.md` Generation**:
        - Verifies that `index.md` is created.
        - Checks that the `index.md` content includes a list of tags.
        - Asserts that each tag in the list is a Markdown link, with the display text being the original tag name and the link target being a sanitized version of the tag name (e.g., `my-tag` becomes `my_tag.md`).
    - **Per-Tag Markdown File Generation**:
        - For each tag in the input `IRSpec`:
            - Verifies that a corresponding Markdown file (e.g., `my_tag.md`) is created using the sanitized tag name.
            - Checks the content of the tag-specific file for:
                - A heading for each operation associated with that tag (e.g., `### {op.operation_id}`).
                - Details for each operation, including its HTTP method (e.g., `**Method:** \`GET\``) and path (e.g., `**Path:** \`/items\``).
    - **Sanitization**: Implicitly tests that `NameSanitizer.sanitize_module_name` is used correctly for generating filenames and links for tags, especially handling tags with special characters (e.g., `My-Tag!`).
- **Test Logic**:
    - An `IRSpec` is constructed with two `IROperation` objects, each assigned to a different tag (one simple, one with special characters).
    - `DocsEmitter().emit()` is called with this spec and an output directory.
    - Assertions then check for the existence and content of `index.md` and the two tag-specific Markdown files.
- **Clarity and Conciseness**:
    - The test is very clear and well-structured.
    - The use of helper functions for creating dummy schemas keeps the main test logic focused.
    - Assertions are specific and directly verify the expected file structure and content snippets.
- **Alignment with `coding-conventions`**:
    - Excellent. The test has a clear G/W/T structure.
    - The docstring is informative and follows the Scenario/Expected Outcome pattern.
    - The use of `NameSanitizer` is consistent with its purpose.
- **Contradictory Expectations/Observations**: None identified. The test thoroughly verifies the core documentation generation capabilities of the `DocsEmitter` for a basic spec with multiple tags and operations.

### `tests/emitters/test_duplicate_operations.py`

- **Overall**: This `pytest`-style suite contains a single test, `test_deduplicate_operation_ids`, which focuses on the behavior of the `EndpointsEmitter` when encountering multiple `IROperation` objects that would sanitize to the same Python method name.
- **Test Naming and Structure**:
    - The test name `test_deduplicate_operation_ids` clearly indicates its purpose.
    - The docstring describes the test: "Test the deduplication of operation IDs with the same sanitized name."
    - Uses the `tmp_path` fixture for output.
- **Key Functionality Tested (`EndpointsEmitter.emit`)**:
    - **Operation ID Deduplication**: This is the core of the test. It verifies that if two operations (e.g., `get_feedback` and `getFeedback`) would normally result in the same sanitized method name (e.g., `get_feedback`), the `EndpointsEmitter` ensures uniqueness by appending a suffix (e.g., `_2`) to the subsequent conflicting names.
    - **File Generation**: Checks that the relevant endpoint file (e.g., `endpoints/feedback.py` based on the tag "Feedback") is created.
    - **Content Verification**: Asserts that the generated Python code within the endpoint file contains both methods, one with the original sanitized name and the other with the deduplicated (suffixed) name.
- **Test Logic**:
    - Two `IROperation` objects are created:
        - `op1` with `operation_id="get_feedback"`.
        - `op2` with `operation_id="getFeedback"`. Both of these would sanitize to `get_feedback`.
    - Both operations are assigned to the same tag ("Feedback").
    - An `IRSpec` is created containing these two operations.
    - The `EndpointsEmitter().emit()` method is called.
    - The test then asserts:
        - The existence of `out/endpoints/feedback.py`.
        - The presence of `"async def get_feedback"` in the file's content (for `op1`).
        - The presence of `"async def get_feedback_2"` in the file's content (for `op2`, the deduplicated version).
- **Clarity and Conciseness**:
    - The test is clear and effectively demonstrates the deduplication mechanism.
    - The setup of `IROperation` objects clearly highlights the naming conflict.
- **Alignment with `coding-conventions`**:
    - Good. The test follows a G/W/T structure.
    - The docstring and name are informative.
- **Assumptions Based on Test**:
    - The test assumes a specific deduplication strategy (appending `_2`, `_3`, etc.).
    - It implicitly relies on `NameSanitizer.sanitize_method_name` for the initial sanitization and the emitter's internal logic for then handling collisions of these sanitized names.
- **Contradictory Expectations/Observations**: None identified. The test verifies a crucial aspect of ensuring valid and non-conflicting generated code when operation IDs are similar.

### `tests/emitters/test_endpoints_emitter.py`

- **Overall**: This `pytest`-style suite extensively tests the `EndpointsEmitter`. It covers the generation of per-tag endpoint client modules, handling of various parameter types (path, query, JSON body, multipart form data), streaming responses, import generation, tag name sanitization, deduplication of tags and operation IDs, and generation of the `endpoints/__init__.py` file.
- **Test Naming and Structure**:
    - Most test functions are descriptively named (e.g., `test_endpoints_emitter_basic`, `test_endpoints_emitter_json_body`, `test_endpoints_emitter__sanitize_tag_name__creates_sanitized_module_and_class`).
    - Many tests include clear docstrings detailing the `Scenario` and `Expected Outcome`, adhering to G/W/T principles.
    - Uses the `tmp_path` fixture extensively for output management.
    - Helper functions (`create_simple_response_schema`, `create_simple_param_schema`) are used in some tests to reduce boilerplate in IR object creation, though many tests define their IR objects inline.
- **Key Functionality Tested (`EndpointsEmitter.emit`)**:
    - **Basic Structure (`test_endpoints_emitter_basic`)**:
        - Verifies that a Python module is created for each tag (e.g., `endpoints/pets.py`, `endpoints/users.py`).
        - Checks that each tag module contains a client class (e.g., `PetsClient`) and async methods corresponding to the operations under that tag.
    - **Request Body Handling**:
        - `test_endpoints_emitter_json_body`: Confirms that an operation with a JSON request body results in a method parameter for the body (e.g., `body: Dict[str, Any]`) and that this is passed as `json=body` (or `json_body`) to the underlying HTTP client call.
        - `test_endpoints_emitter_multipart`: Checks that `multipart/form-data` request bodies lead to a method parameter like `files: Dict[str, IO[Any]]` and that this is passed as `files=files` (or `files_data`) to the HTTP client.
    - **Response Handling**:
        - `test_endpoints_emitter_streaming`: Asserts that a response with `application/octet-stream` and `stream=True` results in a method returning `AsyncIterator[bytes]` and uses `iter_bytes(response)` internally.
        - `test_endpoints_emitter__streaming_inline_object_schema__yields_model`: Tests that if a streaming response has a defined schema (e.g., NDJSON or SSE with an inline object type that should resolve to a model), the method returns `AsyncIterator[MyModel]` and uses appropriate helpers like `iter_ndjson` or `iter_sse` with `MyModel.model_validate` (or similar for Pydantic v1 `parse_obj_as`).
        - `test_endpoints_emitter__streaming_inline_object_schema_not_in_schemas__yields_dict`: Similar to above, but if the inline object schema for streaming is not found in `spec.schemas` (meaning it wasn't promoted to a global model), it should fall back to yielding `Dict[str, Any]`.
    - **Import Generation (`test_endpoints_emitter_imports`)**:
        - Verifies that the generated endpoint modules include necessary imports from `typing` (e.g., `Any, AsyncIterator, Dict, IO, Optional, Union`), the client's `core` (e.g., `HttpTransport, AsyncPaginator, iter_bytes, iter_ndjson, iter_sse`), and potentially from `models` if response/request schemas are models.
    - **Sanitization and Deduplication**:
        - `test_endpoints_emitter__sanitize_tag_name__creates_sanitized_module_and_class`: Ensures that tags with special characters or different casings (e.g., "My Special Tag V2") are sanitized into valid Python module names (e.g., `my_special_tag_v2.py`) and class names (e.g., `MySpecialTagV2Client`).
        - `test_endpoints_emitter__tag_deduplication__single_client_and_import`: Verifies that if multiple raw tags sanitize to the same module/class name (e.g., "User-Ops" and "user_ops"), only one endpoint module and client class are generated, and the `APIClient` imports it correctly once.
        - (Covered by `test_duplicate_operations.py` but related to emitter behavior): Deduplication of `operation_id`s that sanitize to the same method name by appending suffixes.
    - **Parameter Handling**:
        - `test_endpoints_emitter__query_params_included_in_params_dict`: Confirms that query parameters are collected into a `params` dictionary and passed to the HTTP client, while path parameters are used for URL formatting.
        - `test_endpoints_emitter__post_with_body__only_body_param_and_path_query_args`: Ensures that for POST requests with a request body, the generated method signature correctly separates path/query parameters (passed directly or via `params` dict) from the body parameter.
    - **`__init__.py` Generation (`test_endpoints_emitter__init_file_contains_correct_import`)**:
        - Checks that an `endpoints/__init__.py` file is created.
        - Verifies that this `__init__.py` exports all the generated endpoint client classes (e.g., `from .pets import PetsClient`).
- **Clarity and Conciseness**:
    - Many tests are clear and directly target specific generation aspects. Inline IR object definitions, while verbose, make the input explicit for each test.
    - Assertions typically involve checking for the existence of generated files and using string-based `assert ... in content` checks for specific code snippets, class names, method signatures, and import statements. For more complex structural validation, AST parsing or more sophisticated template output comparison might be considered in the future, but string checks are effective for many cases.
- **Alignment with `coding-conventions`**:
    - Good. Tests generally follow G/W/T, and docstrings are often informative.
    - Use of `NameSanitizer` and other utilities is consistent with their intended purpose.
- **Contradictory Expectations/Observations**: None explicitly identified, but the reliance on string assertions for code content means tests could be brittle to minor formatting changes in the generated code that don't affect functionality. However, for specific keywords and signatures, this is a common and often effective approach.

### `tests/emitters/test_exceptions_emitter.py`

- **Overall**: This `pytest`-style suite contains a single test for the `ExceptionsEmitter`. It verifies that the emitter generates an `exception_aliases.py` file containing Python class aliases for HTTP error status codes found in the API specification.
- **Test Naming and Structure**:
    - The test function is named `test_exceptions_emitter_generates_aliases`.
    - It uses the `tmp_path` fixture for managing output files.
- **Key Functionality Tested (`ExceptionsEmitter.emit`)**:
    - **Alias File Generation**: Checks that `exception_aliases.py` is created in the specified output directory.
    - **Error Code Aliasing**: Verifies that for HTTP error codes present in `IROperation` responses (e.g., "404", "500"), corresponding exception classes are generated (e.g., `class Error404(ClientError)`, `class Error500(ServerError)`).
    - **Base Exception Imports**: Asserts that the generated file correctly imports base exception classes (`HTTPError`, `ClientError`, `ServerError`) from the `core.exceptions` module (or a configurable core package path).
- **Test Logic**:
    - An `IRSpec` is created with a single `IROperation` that has responses for status codes "404" and "500".
    - The `ExceptionsEmitter().emit()` method is called.
    - The test then asserts the existence of `exception_aliases.py` and checks its content for the expected class definitions and import statements.
- **Clarity and Conciseness**:
    - The test is clear and concise.
    - The setup of IR objects is minimal and directly relevant to testing exception alias generation.
    - Assertions are straightforward string checks on the file content.
- **Alignment with `coding-conventions`**:
    - Good. The test follows a G/W/T structure.
    - The test name clearly indicates its purpose.
- **Assumptions Based on Test**:
    - The test assumes a naming convention for the generated alias classes (e.g., `Error{STATUS_CODE}`).
    - It assumes that 4xx errors will inherit from `ClientError` and 5xx errors from `ServerError`. (The test data uses 404 and 500, which fit this pattern). The emitter would need logic to determine the correct base class for other codes if this pattern is to be generalized.
- **Contradictory Expectations/Observations**: None identified. The test verifies the fundamental behavior of the `ExceptionsEmitter` for common HTTP error codes.
