    Google's `RE2 <https://github.com/google/re2>`_ regex engine. The regex string must adhere to
    the documented `syntax <https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax>`_. The engine is designed
    to complete execution in linear time as well as limit the amount of memory used.

    Envoy emits two stats for tracking the program size of regexes: the histogram ``re2.program_size``,
    which records the program size, and the counter ``re2.exceeded_warn_level``, which is incremented
    each time the program size exceeds the warn level threshold.
