  abstract = {The changes in brightness of an astronomical source as a function of time are key probes into that source's physics. Periodic and quasi-periodic signals are indicators of fundamental time (and length) scales in the system, while stochastic processes help uncover the nature of turbulent accretion processes. A key method of studying time variability is through Fourier methods, the decomposition of the signal into sine waves, which yields a representation of the data in frequency space. With the extension into spectral timing, the methods built on the Fourier transform can not only help us characterize (quasi-)periodicities and stochastic processes but also uncover the complex relationships between time, photon energy, and flux in order to help build better models of accretion processes and other high-energy dynamical physics. In this chapter, we provide a broad but practical overview of the most important relevant methods.},

  abstract = {A problem with most tests for periodicity is that they are powerful enough to detect only certain kinds of periodic shapes (or 'light curves') in the case of weak signals. This causes a selection effect with the identification of weak periodic signals. Furthermore, the subjective choice of a test after inspection of the data can cause the identification of false sources. A new test for uniformity called the 'H-test' is derived for which the probability distribution is an exponential function. This test is shown to have a very good power against most light curve shapes encountered in X- and gamma-ray astronomy and therefore makes the detection of sources with a larger variety of shapes possible. The use of the H-test is suggested if no a priori information about the light curve shape is available. It is also shown how the probability distribution of the test statistics changes when a periodicity search is conducted using very small steps in the period or frequency range. The flux sensitivity for various light curve shapes is also derived for a few tests and this flux is on average a minimum for the H-test.}

  abstract = {We demonstrate a new method of variability classification using observations of black hole X-ray binaries. Using `power colours' - ratios of integrated power in different Fourier frequency bands - we can clearly differentiate different canonical black hole states as the objects evolve during outburst. We analyse ({$\sim$} 2400) Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of 12 transient low-mass black hole X-ray binaries and find that the path taken around the power colour-colour diagram as the sources evolve is highly consistent from object to object. We discuss how the consistency observed in the power colour-colour diagram between different objects allows for easy state classification based on only a few observations, and show how the power-spectral shapes can be simply classified using a single parameter, the power-spectral `hue'. To illustrate the benefits of our simple model-independent approach, we show that the persistent high-mass X-ray binary Cyg X-1 shows very similar power-spectral evolution to the transient black hole sources, with the main difference being caused by a combination of a lack of quasi-periodic oscillations and an excess of low-frequency power-law noise in the Cyg X-1 power spectra during the transitional state. We also compare the transient objects to the neutron star atoll source Aquila X-1, demonstrating that it traces a different path in the power colour-colour plot. Thus, power colours could be an effective method to classify newly discovered X-ray binaries.},

  abstract = {Analyses of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are important to understanding the dynamic behavior in many astrophysical objects during transient events like gamma-ray bursts, solar flares, magnetar flares, and fast radio bursts. Astrophysicists often search for QPOs with frequency-domain methods such as (Lomb-Scargle) periodograms, which generally assume power-law models plus some excess around the QPO frequency. Time-series data can alternatively be investigated directly in the time domain using Gaussian process (GP) regression. While GP regression is computationally expensive in the general case, the properties of astrophysical data and models allow fast likelihood strategies. Heteroscedasticity and nonstationarity in data have been shown to cause bias in periodogram-based analyses. GPs can take account of these properties. Using GPs, we model QPOs as a stochastic process on top of a deterministic flare shape. Using Bayesian inference, we demonstrate how to infer GP hyperparameters and assign them physical meaning, such as the QPO frequency. We also perform model selection between QPOs and alternative models such as red noise and show that this can be used to reliably find QPOs. This method is easily applicable to a variety of different astrophysical data sets. We demonstrate the use of this method on a range of short transients: a gamma-ray burst, a magnetar flare, a magnetar giant flare, and simulated solar flare data.},

The reductions at different frequencies are not independent, as there is a correlation between the height of the spectrum at any two frequencies, f1 and f2, which is equal to the mean height of the spectrum due to a sinusoidal signal of frequency f1, at the frequency f2. These correlations reduce the distortion in the spectrum of a signal affected by noise. Some numerical illustrations of the properties of least-squares frequency spectra are given.},

We then discuss the response of DFTs to periodic signals and present techniques to recover Fourier amplitude ``lost'' during simple traditional analyses if the periodicities change frequency during the observation. These techniques include Fourier interpolation, which allows us to correct the response for signals that occur between Fourier frequency bins. We then present techniques for estimating additional signal properties such as the signal's centroid and duration in time, the first and second derivatives of the frequency, the pulsed fraction, and an overall estimate of the significance of a detection. Finally, we present a recipe for a basic but thorough Fourier analysis of a time series for well-behaved pulsations.},

The DFT, which can be inverted to recover the original data and the sampling, is used to compute correlation functions by means of a procedure which is effectively, but not explicitly, an interpolation. The CCF can be computed for two time series not even sampled at the same set of times. Techniques for removing the distortion of the correlation functions caused by the sampling, determining the value of a constant component to the data, and treating unequally weighted data are also discussed.

Reverberation time lags occur due to light travel time delays between changes in the direct coronal emission and corresponding variations in its reflection from the accretion flow. Reverberation is detectable using light curves made in different X-ray energy bands, since the direct and reflected components have different spectral shapes. Larger, lower frequency, lags are also seen and are identified with propagation of fluctuations through the accretion flow and associated corona. We review the evidence for X-ray reverberation in active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries, showing how it can be best measured and how it may be modelled. The timescales and energy dependence of the high-frequency reverberation lags show that much of the signal is originating from very close to the black hole in some objects, within a few gravitational radii of the event horizon. We consider how these signals can be studied in the future to carry out X-ray reverberation mapping of the regions closest to black holes.},
