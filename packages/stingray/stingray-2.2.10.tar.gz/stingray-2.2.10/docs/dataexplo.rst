More Data Exploration
*********************

These notebook tutorials show some ways to explore data with
Stingray.


A quick look at a NuSTAR observation
====================================

Stingray transparently loads datasets from many HEASOFT-supported missions.
In this Tutorial, we will show an example quicklook of a NuSTAR observation.

A quick look of LAXPC data analysis
===================================

Stingray now can also read event files and GTI from AstroSat LAXPC mission.
Here is a tutorial on how to load a test observation of Crab pulsar and work 
with various aspects of LAXPC observation (e.g. energy dependent analysis, 
layer dependent extraction, etc.)

Studying very slow variability with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram
================================================================

In this Tutorial, we will show an example of how to use the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram and cross spectrum to study very slow variability in a light curve.
