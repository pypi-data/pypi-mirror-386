[![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/jupyter-ai-contrib/jupyterlab-diff/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jupyter-ai-contrib/jupyterlab-diff/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A JupyterLab extension for showing cell diffs with multiple diffing strategies.

## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 4.0.0

## Installation

### PyPI Installation

```bash
pip install jupyterlab_diff
```

### Development Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jupyter-ai-contrib/jupyterlab-diff.git
cd jupyterlab-diff

# Install the extension in development mode
pip install -e .
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
```

## Usage

### Commands

The extension provides commands to show diffs in multiple formats:

- `jupyterlab-diff:split-cell-diff` - Show cell diff using split view (side-by-side comparison)
- `jupyterlab-diff:unified-cell-diff` - Show cell diff using unified view
- `jupyterlab-diff:unified-file-diff` - Show file diff using unified view for regular Python files and other text files

### Programmatic Usage

#### Split Cell Diff (Side-by-side View)

```typescript
app.commands.execute('jupyterlab-diff:split-cell-diff', {
  cellId: 'cell-id',
  originalSource: 'print("Hello")',
  newSource: 'print("Hello, World!")',
  showActionButtons: true,
  openDiff: true
});
```

#### Unified Cell Diff

```typescript
app.commands.execute('jupyterlab-diff:unified-cell-diff', {
  cellId: 'cell-id',
  originalSource: 'print("Hello")',
  newSource: 'print("Hello, World!")',
  showActionButtons: true
});
```

#### Unified File Diff

```typescript
app.commands.execute('jupyterlab-diff:unified-file-diff', {
  filePath: '/path/to/file.py',
  originalSource: 'print("Hello")',
  newSource: 'print("Hello, World!")',
  showActionButtons: true
});
```

## Architecture

### Diff Strategies

The extension provides two diff viewing strategies:

- **Split diff** (`split-cell-diff`): Uses CodeMirror's two-pane view. Displays original and modified code side-by-side in separate panels with diff highlighting.

- **Unified diff** (`unified-cell-diff`/`unified-file-diff`): Uses CodeMirror's `unifiedMergeView`. Displays changes in a single unified view with added/removed lines clearly marked. Can be used for both cell diffs and regular file diffs.

## Uninstall

To remove the extension, execute:

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab_diff
```

## Troubleshoot

To check the frontend extension is installed:

```bash
jupyter labextension list
```
