# Data Engine Configuration - CoT Hybrid
data_engine:
  instructions: |
    Create scientific and analytical problems that demonstrate both natural reasoning and systematic problem-solving.

    Focus on problems that benefit from:
    - Natural language explanation of concepts
    - Structured step-by-step analysis
    - Clear logical progression
    - Scientific methodology

  # LLM Settings
  provider: "openai"
  model: "gpt-4o"
  temperature: 0.2  # Lower temperature for consistent reasoning
