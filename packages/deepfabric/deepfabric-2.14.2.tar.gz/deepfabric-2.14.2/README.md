**DeepFabric** is a specialised dataset generation and model fine-tuning framework designed for training small language models (SLMs) to become capable agents. By combining reasoning traces with tool calling patterns, and enforcement of type based structured outputs - DeepFabric enables you to fine-tune models that make intelligent decisions, select appropriate tools, and execute multi-step workflows efficiently and with accuracy.

Built for ML engineers, researchers, and AI developers, DeepFabric streamlines the entire agent training pipeline: from hierarchical topic generation to structured reasoning templates to model-ready formats across all major training frameworks. Whether you're building MCP-compatible agents, distilling capabilities into smaller models, or creating specialized tool-calling systems, DeepFabric provides the high-quality, diverse training data you need at scale.

## Generation to Training

DeepFabric datasets are ready for immediate training, multi-format capable with no conversion scripts needed, no preprocessing pipelines, just generate and train:

**Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Drop DeepFabric datasets directly into HuggingFace TRL's `SFTTrainer` for tool-calling and conversational agent training. The `builtin://trl_sft_tools` formatter outputs the exact structure TRL expects, including function schemas and multi-turn tool interactions.

```python
from trl import SFTTrainer
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load your DeepFabric dataset
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files="your_deepfabric_dataset.jsonl")

# Train directly with TRL - no preprocessing needed
trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=model,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    # ... your training config
)
trainer.train()
```

Or if your dataset is already in a different template style, simply re-format on the fly direct within your training notebook.

```python
from trl import SFTTrainer
from datasets import load_dataset

!deepfabric format --repo "org/deepfabric-dataset" -f trl_sft_tools -o dataset.jsonl
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files="dataset.jsonl", split="train")

# Train directly with TRL - no preprocessing needed
trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=model,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    # ... your training config
)
trainer.train()
```

**Reinforcement Learning from Process Supervision (GRPO)**: Train models to generate step-by-step reasoning with the `builtin://grpo` formatter. Ideal for mathematical reasoning, complex problem-solving, and transparent decision-making where each reasoning step can be verified and reinforced.

```python
# GRPO-formatted dataset with explicit reasoning traces
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files="math_reasoning_grpo.jsonl")

# Each example contains structured reasoning steps for RL optimization
# Perfect for training models that show their work
```

**Multi-Framework Support**: The same dataset generation can target Unsloth, Axolotl, or custom frameworks through DeepFabric's formatter system—generate once, experiment with multiple training approaches without regenerating data.

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Hierarchical Topic Generation**: Tree and graph-based architectures for comprehensive domain coverage
- **Multi-Format Export**: Direct export to popular training formats (no conversion scripts needed)
- **Conversation Templates**: Support for various dialogue patterns and reasoning styles
- **Tool Calling Support**: Generate function-calling and agent interaction datasets
- **Structured Output**: Pydantic & Outlines enforced schemas for consistent, high-quality data
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, and more
- **HuggingFace Integration**: Direct dataset upload with auto-generated cards

## Why Train SLMs for Agents?

Training smaller, specialized models for agentic tasks offers distinct advantages over relying on large API-based models:

- **Cost Efficiency**: Deploy fine-tuned agents locally instead of paying per API call, dramatically reducing operational costs
- **Privacy & Control**: Keep sensitive data and agent reasoning entirely within your infrastructure
- **Specialized Behavior**: Train models to follow your exact tool-calling patterns, reasoning styles, and domain expertise
- **Format Flexibility**: Generate once, train everywhere—DeepFabric's formatters support TRL, Unsloth, Axolotl, and custom training frameworks
- **MCP Ecosystem Ready**: Create training datasets optimized for Model Context Protocol servers and standardized tool interfaces

DeepFabric's structured approach ensures your training data teaches not just *what* tools to call, but *why* they're selected and *how* to construct parameters—the reasoning traces that transform models into reliable agents.

## Supported Output Formats

| Format | Template | Use Case | Framework Compatibility |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------------------|
| **TRL SFT Tools** | `builtin://trl_sft_tools` | Tool calling fine-tuning | HuggingFace TRL SFTTrainer |
| **XLAM v2** | `builtin://xlam_v2` | Multi-turn tool calling | Salesforce xLAM models |
| **Tool Calling** | `builtin://tool_calling.py` | Function calling | Agent training |
| **Single Tool Call** | `builtin://single_tool_call.py` | Individual tool calls | Single function execution |
| **GRPO** | `builtin://grpo.py` | Mathematical reasoning | GRPO training |
| **Harmony** | `builtin://harmony.py` | Reasoning with tags | OpenAI gpt-oss |

| **Custom** | `file://your_format.py` | Your requirements | Any framework |

### Custom Format

You can create your own custom output format by implementing a simple Python class with a `format` method using the `deepfabric` library and `BaseFormatter` class. See the [Custom Format Guide](./docs/formatters/custom-formatter-guide.md) for details.

## Conversation Templates

DeepFabric's conversation templates determine how your training data structures reasoning and tool interaction. For agent training, combining reasoning templates (CoT variants) with tool calling creates datasets that teach both *decision-making* and *execution*—the foundation of capable agents.

| Template Type | Description | Agent Training Value |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Tool Calling** | Function invocations with reasoning | Teaches tool selection, parameter construction, and execution patterns |
| **Chain of Thought (CoT)** | Step-by-step reasoning | Enables transparent decision-making for complex multi-step tasks |
| **Structured CoT** | Explicit reasoning traces | Provides clear reasoning paths ideal for agent auditing and debugging |
| **Hybrid CoT** | Mixed reasoning styles | Combines intuitive and analytical thinking for adaptive agents |
| **Multi-Turn** | Extended dialogues | Enables context retention and multi-step planning |
| **System-Prompted** | With system instructions | Defines agent personas, constraints, and behavioral guidelines |
| **Single-Turn** | Question → Answer | Direct task completion and classification tasks |

### Template Missing?

## DeepFabric Pipeline

DeepFabric is designed to work within a modular MLOps pipeline, allowing you to customize each stage of the dataset generation process. The main components are:

- **Topic Generation**: Create a structured topic tree or graph based on a high-level prompt.
- **Data Generation**: Generate training examples for each topic using LLMs.
- **Format Engine**: Convert raw outputs into your desired dataset format.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Topic Prompt] --> B[Topic Tree/Graph]
    B --> C[Data Generator]
    C --> D[Format Engine]
    D --> E[Export/Upload]
```

By decoupling these components, you can easily swap out models, prompts, and formats to suit your specific needs, along with version controlling your configurations for reproducibility.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install DeepFabric

```bash
pip install deepfabric
```

### 2. Generate Your First Dataset

```bash
# Set your API key (or use Ollama for local generation)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Generate a dataset with a single command
deepfabric generate \
  --mode tree \
  --provider openai \
  --model gpt-4o \
  --depth 3 \
  --degree 3 \
  --num-steps 27 \
  --batch-size 1 \
  --topic-prompt "This history Quantum physics" \
  --generation-system-prompt "You are an expert on academic history, with a specialism in the sciences" \
  --dataset-save-as dataset.jsonl
```

Deepfabric will automatically:
- Generate a hierarchical topic tree (3 levels deep, 3 branches per level)
- Create 27 diverse Q&A pairs across the generated topics
- Save your dataset to `dataset.jsonl`

> [!NOTE]  
> Want to generate faster? Increase batch size! For example, if you set `--batch-size 3` and `--num-steps 9` deepfabric will generate 3 entries at a time, while ensuring rate limits of OpenAI are monitored (we use backoff, jitter etc). 

### 3. Use Your Dataset

Your dataset is ready in the OpenAI standard instruct format (JSONL):

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Can you explain Albert Einstein's contribution to quantum theory?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Albert Einstein made significant contributions to quantum theory, particularly through his explanation of the photoelectric effect, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1921. He proposed that light could be thought of as discrete packets of energy called quanta or photons, which could explain how electrons are emitted from metals when exposed to light. This idea was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He later became famous for his skepticism about quantum mechanics probabilistic interpretation, leading to his quote \"God does not play dice with the universe.\""
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Use local models.

Generate larger datasets with different models:

```bash
# With a depth of 4 and degree of 4^5 = 1,024
deepfabric generate \
  --provider ollama \
  --model qwen3:32b \
  --depth 4 \
  --degree 5 \
  --num-steps 100 \
  --batch-size 5 \
  --topic-prompt "Machine Learning Fundamentals"
  --generation-system-prompt "You are an expert on Machine Learning and its application in modern technologies" \
  --dataset-save-as dataset.jsonl
```

There are lots more [examples](./examples/README.md) to get you going.

### Topic Generation Modes

| Mode | Structure | Use Case | Max Topics |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Tree** | Hierarchical branching | Well-organized domains | depth^degree |
| **Graph** | DAG with cross-connections | Interconnected concepts | Flexible |
| **Linear** | Sequential topics | Simple lists | User-defined |
| **Custom** | User-provided structure | Specific requirements | Unlimited |

### Provider Support Matrix

| Provider | Models | Best For | Local/Cloud |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 | High quality, complex tasks | Cloud |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Haiku | Nuanced reasoning | Cloud |
