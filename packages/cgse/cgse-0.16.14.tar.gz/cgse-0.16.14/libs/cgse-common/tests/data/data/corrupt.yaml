# This is just a corrupt YAML file
# in the sense that it doesn't follow the YAML
# standard. The intention for this file is for 
# use in the test_loading_problems.

# The problem with this YAML file is the following line.
# It is not allowed to have both a string (here 'arg') and
# an object (here 'var') as the value of a key.
group: arg
