def create_channel_list(*args) -> str:
    """Createa a channel list that is understood by the SCPI commands of the DAQ6510.

    Channel names contain both the slot number and the channel number. The slot number is the number of the slot where
    the card is installed at the back of the device.

    When addressing multiple individual channels, add each of them as a separate argument, e.g. to include channels 1,
    3, and 7 from slot 1, use the following command:

        >>> create_channel_list(101, 103, 107)
        '(@101, 103, 107)'

    To designate a range of channels, only one argument should be given, i.e. a tuple containing two channels
    representing the range. The following tuple `(101, 110)` will create the following response: `"(@101:110)"`. The
    range is inclusive, so this will define a range of 10 channels in slot 1.

        >>> create_channel_list((201, 205))
        '(@201:205)'
