# vestacrystparser

**vestacrystparser** is an unofficial general-purpose Python parser for
[VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/) crystal visualisation files.
It provides a programmatic API for creating and modifying VESTA files.
It is intended to enable batch-creating consistent visualisation states,
removing the tedium of manually adjusting settings via the GUI.

This project is functional, but feature-incomplete.
High-level API for modifying specific parts of the file in specific ways are
implemented as needed or requested.
Pull requests adding more methods are welcome.
However, the low-level API can cover all cases, albeit requiring more care.

See the [documentation](https://griffin-group.github.io/vestacrystparser/)
for instructions for installation and usage.
