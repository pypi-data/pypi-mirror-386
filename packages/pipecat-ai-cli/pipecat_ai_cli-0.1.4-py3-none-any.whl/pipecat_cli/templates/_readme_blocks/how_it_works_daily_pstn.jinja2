## How It Works

{% if daily_pstn_mode == 'dial-in' %}
1. Daily receives an incoming call to your phone number
2. Daily calls your webhook server (`/daily-webhook` endpoint in `server.py`)
3. The server creates a Daily room with dial-in capabilities
4. The server starts the bot process with the room details (locally or via Pipecat Cloud)
5. The caller is put on hold with music
6. The bot joins the Daily room and signals readiness
7. Daily forwards the call to the Daily room
8. The caller and the bot are connected, and the bot handles the conversation

{% elif daily_pstn_mode == 'dial-out' %}
1. Your application triggers an outbound call
2. The bot creates a Daily room with dial-out capabilities
3. Daily initiates the outbound call to the specified phone number
4. When the call is answered, the bot joins the Daily room
5. The bot and the callee are connected, and the bot handles the conversation
