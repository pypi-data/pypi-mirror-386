Yorùbá Sentiment Checker
A hybrid (Rule-Based + Machine Learning) sentiment analysis tool for classifying Yorùbá text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories. This project addresses the challenge of building NLP tools for low-resource languages by combining the precision of a curated lexicon with the contextual understanding of a statistical model.

**Features**
Hybrid Architecture: Integrates a comprehensive, hand-curated Yorùbá sentiment lexicon with a Logistic Regression classifier for robust sentiment prediction.

**Web Application:** A user-friendly Streamlit web app for real-time sentiment analysis of text or uploaded files. https://yoruba-sentiment-checker.streamlit.app/

**Public Resources:** Provides a valuable public sentiment lexicon for Yorùbá to support further NLP research.

**Reproducible Research:** Complete code and methodology are provided for full transparency and reproducibility.
