VBBL was written by Valerio Bozza and implements algorithm from his 2010 paper 
[(link)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.408.2188B/abstract) which was further improved by [Bozza et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.479.5157B/abstract). Here we use version 3.5.0 of VBBL.

VBBL code was extended by Lawrence Peirson in order to include shear and convergence:

This version of VBBL uses complex polynomial root solver by 
[Skowron and Gould 2012](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1034). See also 
[https://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~jskowron/cmplx\_roots\_sg/](https://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~jskowron/cmplx_roots_sg/).

Please cite the above papers if the VBBL was used for your published research.
