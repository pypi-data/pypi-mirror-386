    """Factory for `sqlalchemy.engine.url.URL` instances.

    The factory constructs a connection string URL object by parsing the
    connection string, the 'db' key in the registry configuration.
    Username, password, host, port or database can be specified as keys in the
    config explicitly. If username or password are missing a matching DB is
    found in the credentials file pointed to by `DB_AUTH_ENVVAR` or
    `DB_AUTH_PATH` values.

        """Parse the `db`, and, if they exist, username, password, host, port
        and database keys from the given config.

        If no  username and password are found in the connection string, or in
        the config, they are retrieved from a file at `DB_AUTH_PATH` or
        `DB_AUTH_ENVVAR`. Sqlite dialect does not require a password.

        The `db` key value of the given config specifies the default connection
        string, such that if no additional connection string parameters are
        provided or retrieved, the `db` key is returned unmodified.

        Parameters
        ----------
        registryConfig : `RegistryConfig`
            Registry configuration.
        db_auth_path : `str`, optional
            An alternative location of DbAuth file, mostly useful for tests.

        Returns
        -------
        connectionString : `sqlalchemy.engine.url.URL`
            URL object representing the connection string.

        Raises
        ------
        DbAuthPermissionsError
            If the credentials file has incorrect permissions.
        DbAuthError
            A problem occurred when retrieving DB authentication.

        Notes
        -----
        Matching requires dialect, host and database keys. If dialect is not
        specified in the db string and host and database keys are not found in
        the db string, or as explicit keys in the config, the matcher returns
        an unchanged connection string.
        Insufficiently specified connection strings are interpreted as an
        indication that a 3rd party authentication mechanism, such as Oracle
        Wallet, is being used and therefore are left unmodified.
