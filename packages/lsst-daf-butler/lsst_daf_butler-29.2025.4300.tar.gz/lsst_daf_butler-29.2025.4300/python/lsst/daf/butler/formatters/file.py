        * Looks like a built-in type.

        store the original Python type information in serialized form and
        instead return built-in types such as `dict` and `list` that need
        to be converted to the required form. This happens before
        `StorageClass` converters trigger so that constructors can be
        called that can build the original type first before checking the
        requested Python type. This is important for Pydantic models where
        the internal structure of the model may not match the `dict` form
        in a scenario where the user has requested a `dict`.
