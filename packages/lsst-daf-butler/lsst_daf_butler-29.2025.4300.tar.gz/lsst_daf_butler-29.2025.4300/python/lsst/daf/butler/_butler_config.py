    The configuration is read and merged with default configurations for

    outlined in `ConfigSubset`. Each component of the configuration associated
    with a configuration class reads its own defaults.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : `str`, `Config`, `ButlerConfig`, optional
        Path to butler configuration YAML file or a directory containing a
        "butler.yaml" file. If `None` the butler will
        be configured based entirely on defaults read from the environment
        or from ``searchPaths``.
        No defaults will be read if a `ButlerConfig` is supplied directly.
    searchPaths : `list` or `tuple`, optional
        Explicit additional paths to search for defaults. They should
        be supplied in priority order. These paths have higher priority
        than those read from the environment in
        `ConfigSubset.defaultSearchPaths()`.  They are only read if ``other``
        refers to a configuration file or directory.
    without_datastore : `bool`, optional
        If `True` remove the datastore configuration.
