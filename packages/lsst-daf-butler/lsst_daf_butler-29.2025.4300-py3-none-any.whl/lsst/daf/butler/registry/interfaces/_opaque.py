    ----------

    Notes
    -----
    Opaque tables are primarily used by `Datastore` instances to manage their
    internal data in the same database that hold the `Registry`, but are not
    limited to this.

    While an opaque table in a multi-layer `Registry` may in fact be the union
    of multiple tables in different layers, we expect this to be rare, as
    `Registry` layers will typically correspond to different leaf `Datastore`
    instances (each with their own opaque table) in a `ChainedDatastore`.
