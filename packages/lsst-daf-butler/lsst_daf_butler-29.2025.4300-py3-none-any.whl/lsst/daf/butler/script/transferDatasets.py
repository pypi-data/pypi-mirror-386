    Parameters
    ----------
    source : `str`
        URI string of the source Butler repo.
    dest : `str`
        URI string of the destination Butler repo.
    dataset_type : `tuple` of `str`
        Dataset type names. An empty tuple implies all dataset types.
    collections : `tuple` of `str`
        Names of collection globs to match. An empty tuple implies all
        collections.
    where : `str`
        Query modification string.
    find_first : `bool`
        Whether only the first match should be used.
    limit : `int`
        Limit the number of results to be returned. A value of 0 means
        unlimited. A negative value is used to specify a cap where a warning
        is issued if that cap is hit.
    order_by : `tuple` of `str`
        Dimensions to use for sorting results. If no ordering is given the
        results of ``limit`` are undefined and default sorting of the resulting
        datasets will be applied. It is an error if the requested ordering
        is inconsistent with the dimensions of the dataset type being queried.
    transfer : `str`
        Transfer mode to use when placing artifacts in the destination.
    register_dataset_types : `bool`
        Indicate whether missing dataset types should be registered.
    transfer_dimensions : `bool`
        Indicate whether dimensions should be transferred along with
        datasets. It can be more efficient to disable this if it is known
        that all dimensions exist.
    dry_run : `bool`, optional
        If `True` no transfers are done but the number of transfers that
        would be done is reported.
