# Toy emulator for module-qc-tool

The emulator uses `module_state.json` to store the current state of the module.
The initial state (when the module is powered off) is copied from the template
file `module_state_template.json`.

For details on what can be run, view the command line interface documentation
for [`mqt emulator`][mqt-emulator].
