# Deployment

This starter pack uses a robust, production-ready deployment strategy that combines **Terraform** for infrastructure as code and a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, tests, and deployments. You can choose between **Google Cloud Build** and **GitHub Actions** as your CI/CD runner.

The recommended way to deploy your agent is with the `agent-starter-pack setup-cicd` command, which automates the entire process.

## Deployment Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is designed with best practices for deploying applications safely and reliably.

**Description:**

1. **CI Pipeline** (e.g., `.github/workflows/pr_checks.yaml` or `.cloudbuild/pr_checks.yaml`):
   - Triggered on pull request creation/update.
   - Runs unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

2. **Staging CD Pipeline** (e.g., `.github/workflows/staging.yaml` or `.cloudbuild/staging.yaml`):
   - Triggered on merge to the `main` branch.
   - Builds and pushes the application container to Artifact Registry.
   - Deploys the new version to the **staging environment**.
   - Performs automated load testing against the staging environment.

3. **Production Deployment** (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy-to-prod.yaml` or `.cloudbuild/deploy-to-prod.yaml`):
   - Triggered after a successful staging deployment.
   - Requires **manual approval** before proceeding to production.
   - Deploys the same container image that was tested in staging to the **production environment**.

## Development Environment Deployment

If you want to deploy a standalone development environment without setting up the full CI/CD pipeline, you can use the `make setup-dev-env` command.

1. **Set your Dev Project:**
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project <your-dev-project-id>
   ```

2. **Deploy Dev Infrastructure:**
   This command runs the Terraform configuration in `deployment/terraform/dev` to provision a development environment.
   ```bash
   make setup-dev-env
   ```

3. **Deploy the Application:**
   Once the infrastructure is ready, deploy your agent to the dev environment.
   ```bash
   make backend
   ```
   
## Automated Deployment with `setup-cicd`

For a streamlined, one-command deployment of the entire CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure, use the `setup-cicd` command from the root of your generated project.

```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack setup-cicd
```

This command handles all the necessary steps:
- **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Uses Terraform to create and configure the necessary resources in your staging and production Google Cloud projects.
- **CI/CD Configuration:** Sets up a complete CI/CD pipeline with your chosen runner (Google Cloud Build or GitHub Actions), including triggers for pull requests and merges to the main branch.
- **Repository Connection:** Connects your GitHub repository to the CI/CD provider.

For a complete guide on the command and its options, see the [**`setup-cicd` CLI Reference**](../cli/setup_cicd.html).

## Required Variables

The deployment uses Terraform variables that need to be configured for your environment. These are defined in `agent-starter-pack/base_template/deployment/terraform/variables.tf`:

### Core Configuration
- **`project_name`**: Base name for resource naming (default: auto-generated from cookiecutter)
- **`prod_project_id`**: Google Cloud Project ID for production deployment
- **`staging_project_id`**: Google Cloud Project ID for staging deployment
- **`cicd_runner_project_id`**: Google Cloud Project ID where CI/CD pipelines execute
- **`region`**: Google Cloud region for resources (default: `us-central1`)

### Repository Connection
- **`repository_name`**: Name of your GitHub repository
- **`repository_owner`**: GitHub username or organization name
- **`host_connection_name`**: Name for Cloud Build connection (default: auto-generated)

### Service Account Permissions
- **`cloud_run_app_roles`** / **`agentengine_sa_roles`**: Roles for the application service account
- **`cicd_roles`**: Roles for CI/CD runner service account
- **`cicd_sa_deployment_required_roles`**: Deployment roles for staging/prod projects

### CI/CD Provider Specific
For **Cloud Build**:
- **`github_app_installation_id`**: GitHub App Installation ID
- **`github_pat`** / **`github_pat_secret_id`**: GitHub Personal Access Token
- **`create_cb_connection`**: Whether to create new Cloud Build connection

For **GitHub Actions**:
- **`create_repository`**: Whether the repository already exists

### Data Ingestion (Optional)
If data ingestion is enabled:
- **`pipeline_cron_schedule`**: Cron schedule for automated ingestion (default: weekly)
- **`pipelines_roles`**: Roles for Vertex AI Pipelines service account

### Vector Search Configuration (Optional)
If using Vertex AI Vector Search:
- **`vector_search_embedding_size`**: Embedding dimensions (default: 768)
- **`vector_search_approximate_neighbors_count`**: Neighbors to return (default: 150)
- **`vector_search_min/max_replica_count`**: Scaling configuration
- **`vector_search_shard_size`**: Shard size (default: SHARD_SIZE_SMALL)
- **`vector_search_machine_type`**: Instance type (default: e2-standard-2)

### Logging Configuration
