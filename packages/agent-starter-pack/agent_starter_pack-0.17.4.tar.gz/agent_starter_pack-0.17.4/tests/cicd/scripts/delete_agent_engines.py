"""
Script to delete all Agent Engine services from specified projects.

This script deletes all Agent Engine services from projects specified via environment variables.

Environment Variables:
- PROJECT_IDS: Comma-separated list of project IDs (e.g., "proj1,proj2,proj3")
- Alternative: Individual variables CICD_PROJECT_ID, E2E_PR_PROJECT_ID, E2E_ST_PROJECT_ID

Example usage:
    export PROJECT_IDS="my-project-1,my-project-2,my-project-3"
    python delete_agent_engines.py

Based on the cleanup logic from tests/cicd/test_e2e_deployment.py
