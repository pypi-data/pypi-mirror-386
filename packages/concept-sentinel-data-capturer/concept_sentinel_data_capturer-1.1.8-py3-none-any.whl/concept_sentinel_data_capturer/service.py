[Input]: "The longest river in India is the Ganges (Ganga), if we consider the entire length of the river system within India, including its tributary, the Bhagirathi-Hooghly, which flows for about 2,525 kilometers (1,569 miles). However, the Godavari is the longest river flowing entirely within Indian territory, measuring about 1,465 kilometers (910 miles) long. The Indus River has a greater total length, approximately 3,180 km (1,976 mi), but much of it flows outside India, through Pakistan.
