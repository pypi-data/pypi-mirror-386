# Qualifiers & List Injection

In the guides so far, we've assumed a simple, one-to-one relationship: you ask for `Database`, you get one `Database`.

But what about a one-to-many relationship? This is a very common scenario:

* You have one `Sender` interface, but multiple implementations: `EmailSender`, `SmsSender`, and `PushNotificationSender`.
* You have one `PaymentProvider` protocol, but two implementations: `StripeProvider` and `PayPalProvider`.

This creates two problems:
1.  If a component just asks for `Sender`, how does the container know *which one* to inject? (This is solved by [`@primary`](./conditional-binding.md)).
2.  What if a component (like a `NotificationService`) needs *all* `Sender` implementations?

This guide solves the second problem using **Qualifiers**. Qualifiers are "tags" you attach to your components, allowing you to inject specific *lists* of implementations.

## 1. The Concept: Tag and Request

The pattern is simple:

1.  **Define a Tag:** You create a `Qualifier` instance. This is your tag.
    ```python
    from pico_ioc import Qualifier
    
    NOTIFICATION = Qualifier("notification")
    PAYMENT = Qualifier("payment")
    ```
2.  **Tag Your Components:** You use the `@qualifier(...)` decorator to apply one or more tags to your component classes.
    ```python
    @component
    @qualifier(NOTIFICATION)
    class EmailSender(Sender): ...
    
    @component
    @qualifier(NOTIFICATION)
    class SmsSender(Sender): ...
    
    @component
    @qualifier(PAYMENT)
    class StripeProvider(PaymentProvider): ...
    ```
3.  **Request a Tagged List:** In your service, you use `typing.Annotated` to request a `List` of all components that match a specific `Qualifier`.
    ```python
    from typing import List, Annotated
    
    @component
    class NotificationService:
        def __init__(
            self,
            senders: Annotated[List[Sender], NOTIFICATION]
        ):
            # self.senders will be [EmailSender(), SmsSender()]
            self.senders = senders
    ```

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Example

Let's build a complete example. We'll create a `PaymentService` that needs to process a payment with *all* available payment providers.

### Step 1: Define the Interface (Protocol)

First, we define the common interface. A `Protocol` is perfect for this.

```python
# providers.py
from typing import Protocol

class PaymentProvider(Protocol):
    """The common interface for all payment providers."""
    def process_payment(self, amount: float) -> str: ...
````

### Step 2: Define the Qualifiers

We'll create a `Qualifier` to tag all our payment providers.

```python
# providers.py
from pico_ioc import Qualifier

PAYMENT = Qualifier("payment")
```

### Step 3: Tag the Implementations

Now, we create our concrete classes. We decorate them with `@component` as usual, but we also add the `@qualifier(PAYMENT)` tag.

```python
# providers.py
from pico_ioc import component, qualifier

@component
@qualifier(PAYMENT)
class StripeProvider(PaymentProvider):
    def process_payment(self, amount: float) -> str:
        print(f"Processing ${amount} with Stripe...")
        return "stripe_tx_123"

@component
@qualifier(PAYMENT)
class PayPalProvider(PaymentProvider):
    def process_payment(self, amount: float) -> str:
        print(f"Processing ${amount} with PayPal...")
        return "paypal_tx_abc"

@component
class SomeOtherComponent:
    """This component is NOT a payment provider and won't be injected."""
    pass
```

### Step 4: Inject the Tagged List

Finally, we create our `PaymentService`. Its constructor asks for a `List[PaymentProvider]` that is `Annotated` with our `PAYMENT` tag.

```python
# services.py
from typing import List, Annotated
from pico_ioc import component
from .providers import PaymentProvider, PAYMENT

@component
class PaymentService:
    def __init__(
        self,
        providers: Annotated[List[PaymentProvider], PAYMENT]
    ):
        # pico-ioc injects a list of all components
        # tagged with @qualifier(PAYMENT)
        self.providers = providers
        print(f"PaymentService loaded with {len(self.providers)} providers.")

    def charge(self, amount: float):
        for provider in self.providers:
            provider.process_payment(amount)
```

### Step 5: Run It

When we initialize the container and get the `PaymentService`, it will automatically have the correct list injected.

```python
# main.py
from pico_ioc import init
from services import PaymentService

# We must tell init() to scan both modules
container = init(modules=["providers", "services"])

service = container.get(PaymentService)
service.charge(100.00)

# Output:
# PaymentService loaded with 2 providers.
# Processing $100.00 with Stripe...
# Processing $100.00 with PayPal...
```

The list `service.providers` contains instances of `StripeProvider` and `PayPalProvider`, but *not* `SomeOtherComponent`.

## Summary

Qualifiers are the standard way to manage one-to-many dependencies in `pico-ioc`.

  * **`Qualifier("name")`** creates a unique tag.
  * **`@qualifier(TAG)`** applies that tag to a component.
  * **`Annotated[List[Interface], TAG]`** requests a list of all components that have been tagged.
