## ADR-007: Built-in Asynchronous Event Bus

**Status:** Accepted

### Context

Decoupling components is a core tenet of DI. While direct injection works well, complex applications benefit from an event-driven approach where components can react to events without direct coupling (Publish/Subscribe pattern). Providing a standard, integrated event bus simplifies implementing this pattern.

### Decision

We included a built-in, **asynchronous event bus** as part of the core library:

1.  **`Event` Base Class:** A simple marker class for event objects (typically `dataclasses`).
2.  **`EventBus` Component:** A core, injectable component (registered via `pico_ioc.event_bus` module) responsible for managing subscriptions and dispatching events. It supports `await bus.publish(event)` (for immediate, awaited handling) and `bus.post(event)` (for queuing).
3.  **`@subscribe(EventType, ...)` Decorator:** Marks methods as event handlers for specific event types. Supports `priority` and `ExecPolicy` ( `INLINE`, `TASK`, `THREADPOOL`) for controlling execution order and concurrency.
4.  **`AutoSubscriberMixin`:** A convenience mixin class. Components inheriting from it will have their `@subscribe` methods automatically registered with the `EventBus` when the component is created (via an `@configure` hook).
5.  **Async Native:** The bus and handlers are designed for `asyncio`, allowing `async def` handlers and non-blocking publishing.

### Consequences

**Positive:** üëç
* Promotes loosely coupled, event-driven architectures within applications using `pico-ioc`.
* Provides a standard, ready-to-use solution, reducing boilerplate for developers.
* Fully integrated with the DI container (bus is injectable, subscribers are components).
* Async-native design fits well with modern Python applications.
* `ExecPolicy` offers control over handler execution (critical path vs. background tasks).

**Negative:** üëé
* Adds features beyond core DI, slightly increasing library scope.
* The event bus is currently in-process and synchronous in its core dispatch loop for `publish` (though handlers can be async or run in threads). It's not a replacement for distributed message queues (like RabbitMQ or Kafka).
* Requires explicit registration of the `pico_ioc.event_bus` module during `init()`.
