## ADR-005: AOP Implementation via Method Interception

**Status:** Accepted

### Context

Applications often require cross-cutting concerns (logging, tracing, caching, security, transactions) applied across multiple methods. Manually adding this logic pollutes business code and violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. We needed a non-intrusive way to add behavior *around* method calls.

### Decision

We implemented Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) using **method interception**:

1.  **`MethodInterceptor` Protocol:** Defined an interface with an `invoke(ctx: MethodCtx, call_next)` method. Implementations of this protocol contain the cross-cutting logic.
2.  **`@intercepted_by(InterceptorType, ...)` Decorator:** Applied to component methods to specify which interceptors should wrap them. Interceptors themselves must be registered components.
3.  **`UnifiedComponentProxy`:** An internal dynamic proxy. When a component with intercepted methods is resolved, it's wrapped in this proxy.
4.  **`__getattr__` Hook:** The proxy's `__getattr__` intercepts calls to decorated methods. It resolves the required interceptor instances from the container and builds an execution chain (`dispatch_method`) that calls each interceptor's `invoke` method around the original method call.
5.  **Async Awareness:** The proxy and `dispatch_method` were designed to correctly handle `await` for `async def` intercepted methods and `async def invoke` methods.

### Consequences

**Positive:** üëç
* Cleanly separates cross-cutting concerns from business logic.
* Interceptors are reusable and testable components.
* The `@intercepted_by` decorator is explicit and declarative.
* Supports both sync and async methods seamlessly.
* Avoids complex bytecode manipulation, relying only on standard Python features (proxies, decorators).

**Negative:** üëé
* Adds a layer of indirection (the proxy), which can slightly complicate debugging if not understood.
* Minor performance overhead due to proxying and interceptor chain execution on each call to an intercepted method (though caching of the wrapped method helps).
* Relies on dynamic proxying, which might interact unexpectedly with tools that do heavy introspection.
