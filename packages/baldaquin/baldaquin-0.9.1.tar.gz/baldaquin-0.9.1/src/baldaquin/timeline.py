    A Timestamp encodes three basic pieces of information:

    * a datetime object in the UTC time zone;
    * a datetime object in the local time zone;
    * a timestamp in seconds, relative to the origin of the parent timeline.

    Timestamp objects support subtraction aritmethics as a handy shortcut
    to calculate time differences.

    Timestamp objects also support serialization/deserialization through the
    :meth:`to_dict() <baldaquin.timeline.Timestamp.to_dict>` and
    :meth:`from_dict() <baldaquin.timeline.Timestamp.from_dict>`, which, in turn, use
    internally a string conversion to ISO format. (``datetime`` objects
    are implemented in C and therefore have no ``__dict__`` slot.)
