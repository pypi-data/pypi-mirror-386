RedirectedMateConnector is MateConnector:
    .doc: """
A mate connector that is intended to be a charge of the redirected_parent.
It might be convenient to define mate connectors relative to
a different coordinate system than the body (or system) we like it to be a charge for.
The local transform of the charge relative the redirected_parent
will be defined by the mates (and SNAP) and local transforms of the owner of the
RedirectedMateConnector and the redirected_parent.
In this way, for example the mate connectors relative the bogie parts of 
a tracked vehicle can be defined in one coordinate system, independent of
which body they are relative. Then the road wheels of the tracked system can
SNAP to those positions, after the bogie parts have SNAP'ed in place.
