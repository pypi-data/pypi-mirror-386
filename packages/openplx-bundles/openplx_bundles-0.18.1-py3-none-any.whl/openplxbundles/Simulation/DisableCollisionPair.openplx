# Declaring a DisableCollisionPair in a system disables
# collisions between all geometries in the two groups.
#
# If you want to disable collisions with a group, create a pair where both group1 and group2 point to the same group
#
DisableCollisionPair:
    group1 is CollisionGroup
    group2 is CollisionGroup
