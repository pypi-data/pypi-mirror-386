# Declaring a CollisionGroup in a system groups geometries
# together so that we can configure how they collide with
# other geometries in a convenient way.
#
# Once geometries has been added to a collision group,
# a DisableCollisionPair can be declared which disables
# collisions between two groups.
#
# Members:
#     systems    - Declares an array of systems for which
#                  we will recursively collect all geometries
#                  in all bodies in the system and their subsystems.
#     bodies     - Declares an array of bodies for which
#                  we will collect all geometries.
#     geometries - Declares an array of geometries that
#                  are added to the group.
