    .doc: """
A sprocket is a profiled wheel with teeth or cogs that engage with the track chain.
It engages the holes in the links of the track and provides the driving force that moves the track.
In tracked systems, it is the sprocket that is motorized, as it performs the essential task of actually
propelling the vehicle forward or backward. It's often located at the front or rear of the vehicle.
