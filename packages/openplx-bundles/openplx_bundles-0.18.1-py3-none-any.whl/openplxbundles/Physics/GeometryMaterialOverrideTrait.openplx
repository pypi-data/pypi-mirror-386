trait GeometryMaterialOverrideTrait:
    .doc: """
Apply this trait to a body or a system to override ContactGeometry materials in that body or
system. Material parameter on geometry will not be changed, but it will not be used in simulation
either. To keep a set material on a geometry, add it to the material_override_geometries_excluded
list.

Note that when the owning system/body has this trait, any changes to materials in a non-excluded
geometry will not have any effect. Also, an override will never override another override This
means that if you have a system with this trait and a body in it also has this trait, the
geometries in the body will keep the material set by the override trait in that body.

material_override - this material will override geometry materials in the body/system
material_override_geometries_excluded - list of geometries that will keep their original material
