PatchElasticity is Physics.Interactions.Flexibility.LinearElastic:
    .doc: """
        Models the interaction between two objects in contact with a unidirectional elasticity.
    Where the model assume contact points, where all are treated as one surface area.
    Compared to the PointwiseElasticity model, the stiffness of the PatchElasticity model
    will remain independent of the number of points.
