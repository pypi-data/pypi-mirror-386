    Isotropic friction model for which the friction force depend on the current normal forces
    acting normal to the friction plane between two bodies.
    To compute the perfect cone while solving the non-linear normal/friction force equations
    is a very sophisticated approach that might be computationally very expensive when there are several interactions 
    and contacts present.
