    Use the ConstantViscousSurfaceFriction to specify the a viscous friction model
    with constant viscosity between two surfaces.

    The unit for the surface viscosity is [N * s / m] or [Pa * s / m]

    The viscosity is only valid for values >= 0.
    If set to infinity, a rigid coupling is assumed.
