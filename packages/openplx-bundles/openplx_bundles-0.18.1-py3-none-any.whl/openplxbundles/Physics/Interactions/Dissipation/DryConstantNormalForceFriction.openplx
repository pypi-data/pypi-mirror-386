    The DryConstantNormalForceFriction extends the DefaultDryFriction model
    by introducing a constant normal force for friction computation.
    The friction limit f_L is always going to be:
    f_L = normal_force * coefficient.
    The model must be considered VERY approximative, since it does not consider friction as
    a non-linear problem.
