Locks bodies together kinematically.

All the bodies specified in the `bodies` array will be locked kinematically, i.e.
they will behave as a single rigid body, they will maintain the translational offset
from the initial positioning after the SNAP algorithm has run. Any existing constraints
between locked bodies will be disabled.
