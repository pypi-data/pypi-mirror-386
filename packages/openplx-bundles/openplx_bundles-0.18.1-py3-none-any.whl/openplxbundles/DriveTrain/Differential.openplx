    The differential in a vehicle transmit torque from the drive_shaft to the left_axle_shaft and right_axle_shaft.
    The default definition is that it will connect the output connector of the drive_shaft to the differential
    so that the differential transmitts torque to the input connectors of the axle shafts.

    The gear_ratio in a vehicle's differential is the difference between the number of times the drive shaft
    needs to rotate in comparison to the axle_shafts.
