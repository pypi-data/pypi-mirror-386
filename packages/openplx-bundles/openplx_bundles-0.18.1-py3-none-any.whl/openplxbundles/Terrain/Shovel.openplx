Shovel:
    .doc: """
    A Shovel can be used to modify terrain.
    body - the rigid body of the shovel
    top_edge - a line that defines the upper edge of the shovel opening
    cutting_edge - a line that defines the lowest edge on the shovel opening
    cutting_direction - the direction of the digging teeth on the shovel
    enabled - only a enabled shovel can be used for digging in terrain
    number_teeth - number of teeth on cutting edge of the shovel
    tooth_min_radius - minimum radius of the shovel's teeth
    tooth_max_radius - minimum radius of the shovel's teeth
    tooth_length - length of shovel's teeth

    Example:

    Scene is Physics3D.System:
        shovel_body is ShovelRigidBody
        shovel is Terrain.Shovel:
            body: shovel_body

            cutting_edge: Math.Line.from_points(shovel_body.bottom_left, shovel_body.bottom_right)
