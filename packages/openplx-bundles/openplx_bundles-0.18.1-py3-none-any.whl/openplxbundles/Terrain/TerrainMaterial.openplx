    A Terrain Material is a Material that in addition to surface properties from Material also
    defines terrain bulk, compaction, excavation and particle properties.

    .agx_terrain_material - An annotation to use to tell AGX which Terrain Material source file to use.
                            Example: .agx_terrain_material: "DIRT_1"
                            This will load the AGX Terrain Material "DIRT_1"

    In the current implementation all these parameters are defined by the Physics Engine, e.g. AGX, but later
    versions will support defining the parameters here.
