## ðŸ“‚ `actions/` â€“ The Agent's Toolkit

This folder contains Python files that define custom actions your agent can perform. Actions are pieces of code that run when your agent needs to do something beyond just responding with text.

**What you'll find:**
- `action_human_handoff.py`: Handles transferring the conversation to a human agent when needed.

**Edit Python files in this folder** to add new custom logic, integrate with APIs, or perform calculations and data processing.

Learn more about custom actions in the [Rasa documentation](https://rasa.com/docs/pro/build/custom-actions).
