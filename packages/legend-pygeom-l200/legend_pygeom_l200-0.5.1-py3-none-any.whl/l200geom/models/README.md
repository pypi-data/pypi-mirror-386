# Model file (i.e. STEP or STL) used for geometry construction

- `BasePlate_medium_ortec.stl`, and `TopPlate_ppc.stl` have been extracted
  from the as-built CAD model of the module assembly (as of October 2022)
- all other `BasePlate_*.stl` are the PEN plates. Source: MaGe
  (`source/legendgeometry/stl_files/`)
  Updated by A. Leonhard, so that the origin in all three coordinates is centered
- `StringSupportStructure.stl` is the support rod for a HPGe string. Source: MaGe
  (`source/legendgeometry/stl_files/`); M. Huber removed the tri-star at the end
- `TriStar_*.stl` and `TopPlates.stl` have been extracted from the as-built CAD
  model of the module assembly (as of October 2022). Those models have been cleaned
  of detailed features by M. Huber.
