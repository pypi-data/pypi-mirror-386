# Public dummy geometry

- All **detector metadata** files in this directory are based on our
  [public testdata](https://github.com/legend-exp/legend-testdata/tree/main/data/legend/metadata/hardware/detectors/germanium/diodes),
  slightly adjusted to fit our detector units.
- The **channelmap** is a stripped down "real" channelmap, that has been cleaned
  from any analysis- or electronics related fields.

  It contains real detector names (to match the naming in the `extra_meta` in
  this repository), but the detectors are not necessarily in the right order or
  position.
