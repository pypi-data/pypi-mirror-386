This is a python library to calculate inductance. Mostly for the purposes of calcualting magnetically confined plasmas. It might someday actually contain some plasma physics, but lets not get too carried away.

## Features

- Self-inductance formulas

  - self inductance of circular, circular hollow, and rectangular section by Maxwell's approximation
  - Lyle's approximation for thick coil solenoid self inductances to 4th and 6th order.
  - Butterworth's approximation for long solenoids
  - Lorentz's perfect analytic solution for current sheet solenoids
  - Babic and Akyel's approximation for thin solenoids

- Mutual-inductance formulas

  - mutual inductance of filaments (Maxwell)

- Filamentary models

  - utility functions to create filament arrays from rectangular definitions of coils and subcoils
  - calculation for filament array mutual inductance
  - calculation of filament array self inductance

- Green's functions

  - calculation of Green's functions for Psi, Br, and Bz from filamented coils to points
    - with Numba, calculation of green's functions for arbitrary grids of points
  - calculation fo Green's functions for coil forces

- Arbitrary coil shapes
  - rudimentary support for arbitrary wire filament coil shapes

## Requirements

_Inductance_ requires [_NumPy_][numpy] and uses [_Numba_][numba] for acceleration. It is written in mostly pure python referencing academic articles for calculating inductances by various methods, most of which rely on elliptic functions. _Inductance_ provides _Numba_ accelerated pure python elliptic functions.

It is possible to remove the dependence on Numba and get most of the functionality of _Inductance_. The plan is to provide different options, including with alternative accelerators, such as [_JAX_][jax]. For now, the requirements are:

- python >= 3.8
- numpy >= 1.24
- numba >= 0.57

## Installation

You can install _inductance_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install inductance
```

## Reference

Please see the [reference] for details.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome.

## License

Distributed under the terms of the [MIT license][license],
_inductance_ is free and open source software.

## Issues

For now, this is a very early release. It is likely a new top level API will be
developed as the library matures.

If you encounter any problems,
please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.
