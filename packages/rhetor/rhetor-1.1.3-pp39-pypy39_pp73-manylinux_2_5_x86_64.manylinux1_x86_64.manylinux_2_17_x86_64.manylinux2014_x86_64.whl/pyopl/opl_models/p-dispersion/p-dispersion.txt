In the p-dispersion (maxâ€“min dispersion) problem, given distances between candidate sites, we select exactly p locations to maximize the minimum pairwise distance among the chosen sites; binary selection variables indicate chosen locations, an auxiliary variable represents the minimum distance, and constraints link pairwise co-selection and bound that minimum by the distance of every selected pair.
