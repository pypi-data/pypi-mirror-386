A set of workers must be assigned to a set of tasks so that each worker performs exactly one task and each task is performed by exactly one worker. Assigning a particular worker to a particular task incurs a known cost, and the objective is to choose the one-to-one pairing of workers to tasks that minimizes the total assignment cost.
