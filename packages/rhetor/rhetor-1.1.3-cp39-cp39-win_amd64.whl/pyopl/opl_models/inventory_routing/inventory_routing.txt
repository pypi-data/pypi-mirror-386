Consider a multi-period inventory replenishment problem for multiple stores. Over a three-period horizon, the planner chooses delivery quantities to each store each period to satisfy known demands while respecting store capacity limits and inventory flow from given initial stocks. Deliveries incur store-specific per-unit transport costs and on-hand inventory incurs a per-unit-per-period holding cost; the objective is to minimize the total transport plus holding cost subject to nonnegative deliveries and inventories and no stockouts.
