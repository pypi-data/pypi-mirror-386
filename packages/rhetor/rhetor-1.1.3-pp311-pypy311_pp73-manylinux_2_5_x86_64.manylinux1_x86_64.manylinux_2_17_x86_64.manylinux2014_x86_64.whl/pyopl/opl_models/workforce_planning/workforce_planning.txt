Consider a multi-period workforce planning problem with multiple skill levels and task types. Over the planning horizon, decisions include hiring, firing, and training workers between adjacent skill levels; determining the workforce available by skill in each period; assigning worker-hours by skill to tasks; and using overtime, with the aim of meeting task demand using qualified skills. Assignments are limited by productive capacity (workforce Ã— productivity) plus overtime, overtime per worker is capped, workforce evolves from the initial staff via hires/fires/training, hires and fires are bounded each period, total headcount is constrained by managerial span of control, and per-period spending (hiring, firing, training, regular wage, overtime) must respect a budget. The objective minimizes the total cost of hiring, firing, training, regular wages, and overtime over all periods.
