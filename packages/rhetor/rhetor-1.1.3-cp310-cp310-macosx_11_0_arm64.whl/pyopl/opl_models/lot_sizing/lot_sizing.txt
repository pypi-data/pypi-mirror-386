In the single-item lot sizing problem, over a T-period horizon, the planner chooses production quantities and binary setup decisions each period to satisfy known demands without backlogging, while minimizing the sum of fixed setup, unit production, and inventory holding costs; inventory follows a flow balance from production minus demand, and production in a period is permitted only if a setup is taken.
