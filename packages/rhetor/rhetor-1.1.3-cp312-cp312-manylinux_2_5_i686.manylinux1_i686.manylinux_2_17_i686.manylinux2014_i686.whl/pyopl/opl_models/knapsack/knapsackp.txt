Each item provides value and consumes amounts of several resources; the decisions are which items to take and how much capacity to allocate to each resource, with per-resource capacities required to cover chosen itemsâ€™ usage and a single total capacity budget across all resources. The objective is to maximize total value while respecting these resource and budget constraints.
