Each node in a graph is assigned a positive integer color such that adjacent nodes receive different colors, and the objective is to minimize the number of colors used (represented by the maximum color across nodes). The formulation bounds colors between 1 and the number of nodes and uses a big-M encoding with auxiliary binary variables to enforce the “different colors” constraint on each edge.
