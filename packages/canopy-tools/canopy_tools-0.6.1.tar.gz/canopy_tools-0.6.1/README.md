**canopy** is an open source python project designed to support research in the field of vegetation dynamics and climate modelling by providing tools for **analysing** and **visualising** Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (**DGVM**) **outputs**. 

# Installation

```bash
# Create a conda environment (optionnal)
conda create --name canopy python=3.12
conda activate canopy

# Use conda-forge to install canopy
conda install canopy-tools --channel conda-forge

# ... or pip

```

# Documentation

You can find the canopy documentation on [canopy-tools.readthedocs.io](https://canopy-tools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

### How to use

You can use canopy in two modes:

- [Interactive mode](https://canopy-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html#interactive-mode), an intuitive and flexible mode, to analyse data and generate figures using python functions.

- [JSON mode](https://canopy-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html#json-mode), a easy-to-use and fast mode, to generate figures using a structured JSON configuration file.

### Technical documentation

- [Spatial Reduction Operations](https://canopy-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical_documentation.html#spatial-reduction-operations)

# Gallery website

[https://canopy.imk-ifu.kit.edu/](https://canopy.imk-ifu.kit.edu/)

**What is it?** An interactive website showcasing figures created with canopy, where each image links to the code that generated it. Users can also submit their own canopy code (Python or JSON) and figure to be featured, helping build a collection of examples that make learning canopy easy and inspiring.
