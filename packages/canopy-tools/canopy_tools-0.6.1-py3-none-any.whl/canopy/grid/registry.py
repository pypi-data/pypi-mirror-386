"""Registry functionality for grids and grid operations.

This module provides:

- A registry of different Grid types: A dictionary where the keys are string identifiers for each
  type of grid (e.g. `'sites'`, `'lonlat'`...) and the values are the corresponding subclass of Grid
  (e.g. `GridSites`, `GridLonLat`...)
- A registry of spatial reduction operations on the different grids: A dictionary where the keys are
  tuples of the form `(grid_type, operation, axis)`, and the values are the functions that perform the
  operation on the dataframe. In the key, `grid_type` is the string identifier of the grid (`'sites'`, `'lonlat'`...),
  `operation` is a string identifying the reduction operation, and `axis` is the axis name as it appears
  on the DataFrame index.

Examples
--------
Suppose we want to register a cartesian grid and its associated operations. The first step is to
create a new file in the grid/ folder. This file will contain the grid description and the supported
grid operations. Let's assume the file is grid/grid_xy.py. The code described below goes in this file.

We first define a new class, GridXY, inheriting from the Grid abstract base class. This class
will be registered with the string identifier passed to the register_grid class decorator:

.. code-block::

    from canopy.grid.grid_abc import Grid
    grid_type = 'xy' # String used to register this grid type.
    @register_grid(grid_type)
    class GridXY(Grid):
        super().__init__(axis0 = 'x', axis1 = 'y')
        ...

The Grid object's documentation details the mandatory abstract methods to implement.

we define the operations that are allowed on this grid, and register them with the
register_gridop decorator. This decorator will use the name of the function to form a key to
identify the operation. The name of the function must be of the format `operation_axis`.
For example, to register an averaging operation along the x axis, we would do:

.. code-block::

    @register_gridop(grid_type)
    def av_x(df: pd.DataFrame, grid: Grid) -> pd.DataFrame:
        ...

Note that grid operations have all the same signature.

Lastly, we need to add the new file, grid/grid_xy.py, to grid/__init.py__:

    import canopy.grid.grid_xy

If all went well, the new grid type and grid operations will be available. For example, the
following should work:

.. code-block::

    from canopy.field import Field
    field = Field.from_file(path, grid_type='xy')
    field.red_space('av', 'x', inplace=True)
    print(field)

    Notes
    -----
    The decorator forms the registry key (the tuple `(grid_type, operation, axis)`) from the
    argument `grid_type`, supplied to the decorator, and the name of the decorated function,
    which must be of the form `operation_axis`.

    The name of the operation can be any string. But it should make sense and be consistent
    with all the other gridops (for example, if you want to register averaging operations for
    axes `'x'` and `'y'`, don't use `mean_x` and `av_y`).

    The names of the axes, however, must be the consistent with the names of the indices on
    the DataFrame that the operation is meant to act on.
