## Core Agent Communication Flow (Importance Score: 95)
- Agent Hub (`src/agentor/agenthub/main.py`) orchestrates multi-agent communication
- Triage agent evaluates requests and routes to specialized agents
- Cross-agent handoff protocol enables task delegation between specialized agents

## Memory System Data Flow (Importance Score: 90)
`src/agentor/memory/api.py` implements:
- Bi-directional conversation storage flow between agents and LanceDB
- Vector embedding pipeline for semantic search capabilities
- Contextual retrieval system for maintaining conversation history

## Google Integration Data Pipeline (Importance Score: 85)
`src/agentor/integrations/google/google_agent.py`:
- OAuth credential flow management for Google services
- Bi-directional data synchronization with Gmail/Calendar APIs
- Read-only data access patterns for privacy protection

## Agent-Memory Interaction Pattern (Importance Score: 80)
`src/agentor/agenthub/memagent.py`:
- Memory agent handles persistent storage requests
- Conversation embedding and indexing workflow
- Context retrieval pattern for maintaining conversation state

## External Service Integration Flow (Importance Score: 75)
- Standardized tool integration pattern for external services
- Credential management flow for service authentication
- Service-specific data transformation pipelines

## Cross-Tool Intelligence Flow (Importance Score: 70)
- Data correlation pattern between different tools
- Context sharing mechanism between specialized agents
- Unified response formatting pipeline for multi-source data

## Core Data Flow Components

### Agent Communication Flow
- Agents communicate through the `Agentor` class orchestration layer
- Tool requests flow from agents to the global registry for execution
- Results propagate back through the agent system to maintain context
- Importance Score: 85

### Memory System Data Flow
- Conversational data flows through LanceDB vector storage
- Search queries route through semantic embedding pipeline
- Memory retrieval integrates with agent decision making process
- Memory updates synchronize through API layer
- Importance Score: 80

### External Service Integration Flow
- Tool requests route through `AgentMCP` for appropriate handling
- OAuth authentication flow manages credential updates
- Celesto SDK client handles bi-directional external service communication
- Importance Score: 75

## Key Data Flow Paths

1. Agent-Memory Flow
```
Agent -> Memory API -> LanceDB Storage -> Memory API -> Agent
```
Location: `src/agentor/memory/api.py`
Importance Score: 85

2. Tool Request Flow
```
Agent -> Tool Registry -> External Service -> Tool Registry -> Agent
```
Location: `src/agentor/tools/registry.py`
Importance Score: 80

3. Google Service Integration Flow
```
GoogleAgent -> SDK Client -> Google APIs -> SDK Client -> GoogleAgent
```
Location: `src/agentor/agenthub/google/google_agent.py`
Importance Score: 75

## Critical Integration Points

### Memory System Integration
- Location: `src/agentor/memory/api.py`
- Handles conversational data persistence
- Manages context retrieval for agent decisions
- Importance Score: 85

### Tool Hub Integration
- Location: `src/agentor/sdk/client.py`
- Routes external service requests
- Manages authentication and response handling
- Importance Score: 80

### Agent Communication Hub
- Location: `src/agentor/agents.py`
- Orchestrates inter-agent communication
- Manages tool request routing
- Importance Score: 90
