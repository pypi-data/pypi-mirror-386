"""
Book test addresses problems with data science RnD workflow and regression
testing.

In data science:

 1. There are often no right/wrong answers, but good/bad answers.
    This emphasizes a need to see and compare changes in results
 2. the data is big and state preparations are costly
 3. At the same time, there is a need for regression testing

For this reason, there is a need for a tool, that handles ability to
see results and the cacheing as nicely as the Jupyter notebook, but that also
supports regression testing similarly to traditional unit test suites.
