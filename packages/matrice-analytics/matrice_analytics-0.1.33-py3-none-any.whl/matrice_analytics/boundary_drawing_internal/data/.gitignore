# Boundary Drawing Tool Data Files
# This directory contains user-generated boundary tool files
# These files are created when users draw boundaries and should not be in version control

# Ignore all files in this directory except this .gitignore
*
!.gitignore

# Explanation:
# - Each boundary tool session creates a unique timestamped directory
# - Contains HTML files, processed images, and configuration files
# - These are user-specific and should remain local
