# Contribution Guides

## Signing your contribution
To help ensure the integrity and authenticity of contributions, all contributors are required to sign their commits. This is done by adding a 'Signed-off-by' line to each commit message, certifying compliance with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).

### How to sign your commits

You can sign your commits using the `-s` or `--signoff` option with `git commit`:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This will append a line like the following to your commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>

Make sure the name and email address match your Git configuration. You can check your current settings with:

```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

If you need to update them:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

All commits must be signed to be accepted.
