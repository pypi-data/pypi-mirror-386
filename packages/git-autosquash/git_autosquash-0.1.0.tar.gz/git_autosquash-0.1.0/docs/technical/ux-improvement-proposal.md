# User Experience Improvement Proposal: Simplified Binary Model

## Executive Summary

Based on the analysis of the current three-state model (skip/squash/ignore), this proposal recommends implementing a simplified binary approach that reduces cognitive load, improves workflow efficiency, and aligns with Git users' mental models.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Code Architecture Issues

The current system spreads state management across multiple files:
- `tui/widgets.py`: Individual checkbox handling (116 lines)
- `tui/state_controller.py`: Central state management (140+ lines) 
- `tui/app.py`: Result handling with legacy compatibility (74+ lines)

**Key Problems Identified:**

1. **Mutual Exclusion Complexity:**
   ```python
   def set_ignored(self, mapping: HunkTargetMapping, ignored: bool) -> None:
       if ignored:
           self._ignored.add(index)
           # Clear approved when ignoring (mutually exclusive)
           self._approved.discard(index)
   ```

2. **State Synchronization Issues:**
   - Widget state can become inconsistent with controller state
   - No bidirectional binding between checkboxes

3. **Legacy Compatibility Burden:**
   ```python
   def _handle_approval_result(self, result: bool | dict | List[HunkTargetMapping] | None):
       # Handles 4 different result types for backward compatibility
   ```

## Proposed Binary Model Implementation

### Core Concept

Replace the three-state model with a binary decision: **Process** or **Skip**

- **Process**: Hunk will be squashed into its target commit
- **Skip**: Hunk remains untouched in working tree

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Simplified State Management

```python
# New simplified state controller
class SimplifiedUIStateController:
    def __init__(self, mappings: List[HunkTargetMapping]):
        self.mappings = mappings
        self._to_process = set()
        self._apply_smart_defaults()
    
    def _apply_smart_defaults(self):
        """Auto-select high-confidence hunks for processing."""
        for i, mapping in enumerate(self.mappings):
            if mapping.confidence == "high":
                self._to_process.add(i)
    
    def should_process(self, mapping: HunkTargetMapping) -> bool:
        index = self._get_index(mapping)
        return index in self._to_process
    
    def set_process(self, mapping: HunkTargetMapping, process: bool):
        index = self._get_index(mapping)
        if process:
            self._to_process.add(index)
        else:
            self._to_process.discard(index)
```

**Lines of Code:** ~40 (vs current 140+)
**Complexity Reduction:** 70%

#### Phase 2: Updated Widget Design

```python
# Simplified widget with single checkbox
class HunkMappingWidget(Widget):
    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        # ... existing hunk display code ...
        
        # Single action selection
        with Horizontal():
            confidence_icon = self._get_confidence_icon()
            should_process = self.controller.should_process(self.mapping)
            yield Static(confidence_icon, classes="confidence-indicator")
            yield Checkbox(
                "Process this hunk", 
                value=should_process, 
                id="process-checkbox"
            )
            if should_process:
                yield Static("→ Will squash", classes="action-preview")
    
    def _get_confidence_icon(self) -> str:
        confidence = self.mapping.confidence
        return {
            "high": "✓",    # Green checkmark
            "medium": "?",  # Yellow question mark  
            "low": "!",     # Red exclamation
        }.get(confidence, "?")
```

#### Phase 3: Post-Processing Options

After successful squashing, present a simple choice:

```python
class PostProcessScreen(Screen):
    """Screen for post-processing options after squashing."""
    
    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Header()
        yield Container(
            Static("Squashing completed successfully!", classes="success-message"),
            Static(f"Processed {len(self.processed_hunks)} hunks"),
            Static("What would you like to do with the processed changes?"),
            Button("Keep changes in working tree", id="keep", variant="primary"),
            Button("Remove changes from working tree", id="remove"),
            Button("Let me decide per file", id="selective"),
            classes="post-process-container"
        )
        yield Footer()
```

## User Experience Benefits

### 1. Cognitive Load Reduction

**Before (Three-State):**
- User must understand: Skip vs Ignore distinction
- Must remember: Approve + Ignore are mutually exclusive  
- Decision points: 3 states × N hunks = 3N decisions

**After (Binary):**
- Single concept: Process or Don't Process
- Decision points: 2 states × N hunks = 2N decisions
- **33% reduction in decision complexity**

### 2. Smart Defaults Workflow

**Current:** All hunks start as "Skip" (inactive)
**Proposed:** High-confidence hunks start as "Process" (active)

**Impact:** Users can immediately execute common workflows with minimal interaction.

Example workflow:
1. **Review screen loads** → 70% of hunks already selected (high confidence)
2. **User scans remaining** → Quickly approve/skip medium/low confidence hunks  
3. **Execute** → Most hunks processed with minimal effort

### 3. Improved Visual Design

**Current UI:**
```
[✓] Approve for squashing    [✗] Ignore (keep in working tree)
```

**Proposed UI:**
```
✓ [ Process this hunk ] → Will squash into abc123ef
? [ Process this hunk ] → Will squash into def456ab  
! [ ] Process this hunk → Will squash into ghi789cd
```

**Benefits:**
- Immediate visual confidence indicator
- Clear action preview
- Single interaction point per hunk

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Feature Flag Implementation (Week 1-2)

```python
# Configuration option
USE_BINARY_MODEL = os.getenv("GIT_AUTOSQUASH_BINARY_UI", "false").lower() == "true"

class AutoSquashApp(App):
    def __init__(self, mappings):
        self.use_binary_model = USE_BINARY_MODEL
        if self.use_binary_model:
            self.controller = SimplifiedUIStateController(mappings)
        else:
            self.controller = UIStateController(mappings)  # Current implementation
```

### Phase 2: A/B Testing (Week 3-4)

Collect metrics on:
- Task completion time
- User error rates  
- Cognitive load indicators (time spent per hunk decision)
- User preference feedback

### Phase 3: Gradual Migration (Week 5-6)

1. Default to binary model for new users
2. Provide fallback option for existing users
3. Deprecate three-state model after validation period

## Risk Analysis

### Low Risk Changes
- Smart defaults implementation
- Visual design improvements
- Post-processing screen addition

### Medium Risk Changes  
- State controller replacement
- Widget logic simplification
- Result handling updates

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Feature flag protection** - Easy rollback capability
2. **Comprehensive testing** - Maintain 100% test coverage
3. **User feedback loops** - Monitor usage patterns
4. **Documentation updates** - Clear migration guide

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Goals
- **60%+ reduction** in codebase complexity
- **30%+ faster** task completion for typical workflows
- **50%+ reduction** in user errors during hunk selection
- **Zero regression** in core functionality

### Qualitative Goals
- Improved user satisfaction scores
- Reduced support requests about UI confusion
- Better alignment with Git user mental models
- Simplified onboarding for new users

## Conclusion

The proposed binary model represents a significant improvement in both user experience and code maintainability. By eliminating the confusion between "skip" and "ignore" states, implementing smart defaults, and reducing cognitive load, we can create a more intuitive and efficient workflow while substantially reducing codebase complexity.

The phased migration approach minimizes risk while allowing for data-driven validation of the improvements. This proposal aligns with modern UI/UX best practices and Git users' established mental models.
