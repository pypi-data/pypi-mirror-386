# Git Worktree Investigation for Enhanced Hunk Processing

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED**: This investigation concluded that the worktree strategy provided no meaningful benefits over the index strategy while adding significant complexity. The worktree strategy has been removed from the codebase. This document is maintained for historical reference only.

> **CONCLUSION**: After thorough investigation and implementation, the worktree strategy was determined to be unnecessary complexity. The index strategy provides equivalent functionality with better performance and simpler maintenance.

## Current Approach Analysis

Our current git-native handler uses index manipulation within the main working tree:

1. **Capture index state** using `git write-tree`
2. **Stage hunks individually** using `git apply --cached` 
3. **Generate combined patch** using `git diff --cached`
4. **Restore index** using `git read-tree`
5. **Apply final patch** to working tree using `git apply`

### Limitations of Current Index-Based Approach

1. **Index Pollution**: Temporarily modifies the main repository's index
2. **Race Conditions**: Other git operations during processing could interfere
3. **Complex State Management**: Need to carefully restore index state
4. **Single Threading**: Only one operation can safely modify index at a time

## Git Worktree Alternative

Git worktree provides isolated working directories that share the same repository but have:
- **Separate working tree**: Each worktree has its own file checkout
- **Separate index**: Each worktree maintains its own staging area
- **Shared object database**: All worktrees share commits, branches, tags
- **Shared references**: All worktrees see the same branches and remotes

### Potential Benefits

1. **Complete Isolation**: Each hunk processing operation in separate worktree
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple worktrees can process hunks simultaneously
3. **No Index Contamination**: Main repository index remains untouched
4. **Atomic Operations**: Each worktree can be created/destroyed atomically
5. **Simplified Cleanup**: Remove worktree removes all associated state

### Proposed Worktree-Based Approach

```python
class GitWorktreeIgnoreHandler:
    \"\"\"Enhanced ignore handler using git worktree for complete isolation.\"\"\"
    
    def apply_ignored_hunks(self, ignored_mappings: List[HunkTargetMapping]) -> bool:
        \"\"\"Apply ignored hunks using isolated git worktrees.\"\"\"
        
        # Phase 1: Create comprehensive backup (same as current)
        backup_stash = self._create_comprehensive_backup()
        
        try:
            # Phase 2: Create temporary worktree for hunk processing  
            worktree_path = self._create_temporary_worktree()
            
            # Phase 3: Apply hunks in isolated environment
            success = self._apply_hunks_in_worktree(ignored_mappings, worktree_path)
            
            if success:
                # Phase 4: Extract processed changes back to main worktree
                self._extract_changes_from_worktree(worktree_path)
                return True
            else:
                # Phase 5: Restore from backup on failure
                self._restore_from_stash(backup_stash)
                return False
                
        finally:
            # Phase 6: Cleanup temporary worktree and backup
            self._cleanup_worktree(worktree_path)
            self._cleanup_stash(backup_stash)
```

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Temporary Worktree Creation

```python
def _create_temporary_worktree(self) -> str:
    \"\"\"Create temporary worktree for isolated hunk processing.\"\"\"
    
    # Generate unique worktree path
    timestamp = int(time.time())
    worktree_name = f"git-autosquash-temp-{timestamp}"
    worktree_path = f"/tmp/{worktree_name}"
    
    # Create detached worktree at current HEAD
    success, _ = self.git_ops._run_git_command(
        "worktree", "add", "--detach", worktree_path, "HEAD"
    )
    
    if success:
        return worktree_path
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Failed to create temporary worktree")
```

#### 2. Isolated Hunk Application

```python  
def _apply_hunks_in_worktree(self, mappings: List[HunkTargetMapping], worktree_path: str) -> bool:
    \"\"\"Apply hunks within isolated worktree environment.\"\"\"
    
    # Create git operations instance for the worktree
    worktree_git_ops = GitOps(worktree_path)
    
    # Apply each hunk directly to worktree files
    for mapping in mappings:
        hunk_patch = self._create_minimal_patch_for_hunk(mapping.hunk)
        
        # Apply patch directly in worktree (no --cached needed)
        success, error = worktree_git_ops._run_git_command_with_input(
            "apply", input_text=hunk_patch
        )
        
        if not success:
            self.logger.error(f"Failed to apply hunk in worktree: {error}")
            return False
    
    return True
```

#### 3. Change Extraction

```python
def _extract_changes_from_worktree(self, worktree_path: str) -> bool:
    \"\"\"Extract processed changes from worktree back to main repository.\"\"\"
    
    # Generate patch of all changes in worktree
    worktree_git_ops = GitOps(worktree_path)
    success, patch_content = worktree_git_ops._run_git_command(
        "diff", "HEAD"
    )
    
    if not success or not patch_content.strip():
        self.logger.warning("No changes found in worktree to extract")
        return True
    
    # Apply the extracted patch to main working tree
    success, error = self.git_ops._run_git_command_with_input(
        "apply", input_text=patch_content
    )
    
    if success:
        self.logger.info("Successfully extracted changes from worktree")
        return True
    else:
        self.logger.error(f"Failed to extract changes from worktree: {error}")
        return False
```

#### 4. Cleanup

```python
def _cleanup_worktree(self, worktree_path: str) -> None:
    \"\"\"Remove temporary worktree and associated metadata.\"\"\"
    
    if not worktree_path:
        return
        
    # Remove worktree (this also cleans up git metadata)
    success, output = self.git_ops._run_git_command(
        "worktree", "remove", "--force", worktree_path
    )
    
    if success:
        self.logger.debug(f"Cleaned up temporary worktree: {worktree_path}")
    else:
        self.logger.warning(f"Failed to cleanup worktree {worktree_path}: {output}")
        # Attempt manual cleanup
        try:
            import shutil
            shutil.rmtree(worktree_path, ignore_errors=True)
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.warning(f"Manual worktree cleanup failed: {e}")
```

## Performance Analysis

### Current Index Approach Performance

**Operations per hunk application:**
- 1x write-tree (capture index)
- 1x hash-object (blob info)
- 1x rev-parse (blob info) 
- 1x ls-files (blob info)
- 1x apply --cached (stage hunk)
- 1x read-tree (restore index)
- 1x diff --cached (generate patch)
- 1x apply --check + 1x apply (validate + apply)

**Total: ~8 git operations per batch + 1 per hunk**

### Proposed Worktree Approach Performance

**Operations per hunk application:**
- 1x worktree add (create isolated environment)
- 1x apply per hunk (direct application, no staging needed)
- 1x diff HEAD (extract changes)
- 1x apply (apply to main worktree)
- 1x worktree remove (cleanup)

**Total: ~5 git operations per batch + 1 per hunk**

### Benefits Analysis

1. **Reduced Complexity**: No index state management
2. **Better Isolation**: Complete separation from main repository state
3. **Potential Parallelization**: Multiple worktrees can be processed simultaneously
4. **Simpler Error Recovery**: Worktree removal cleans all state
5. **More Natural Git Operations**: Direct file application vs index manipulation

## Security Considerations

### Temporary Directory Security

```python
def _create_secure_worktree_path(self) -> str:
    \"\"\"Create secure temporary directory for worktree.\"\"\"
    
    import tempfile
    import os
    
    # Create secure temporary directory
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="git-autosquash-", suffix="-worktree")
    
    # Ensure proper permissions (owner only)
    os.chmod(temp_dir, 0o700)
    
    return temp_dir
```

### Path Validation

Same path validation as current approach, but applied within worktree context:

```python
def _validate_worktree_paths(self, mappings: List[HunkTargetMapping], worktree_path: str) -> bool:
    \"\"\"Validate paths within worktree context.\"\"\"
    
    worktree_root = Path(worktree_path).resolve()
    
    for mapping in mappings:
        file_path = Path(mapping.hunk.file_path)
        
        # Same validation as current approach
        if file_path.is_absolute():
            return False
            
        resolved_path = (worktree_root / file_path).resolve()
        try:
            resolved_path.relative_to(worktree_root)
        except ValueError:
            return False
    
    return True
```

## Compatibility Analysis

### Git Version Requirements

Git worktree was introduced in Git 2.5.0 (July 2015). Most modern systems should support it.

```python
def _check_worktree_support(self) -> bool:
    \"\"\"Check if git worktree is supported.\"\"\"
    
    success, output = self.git_ops._run_git_command("worktree", "--help")
    return success and "add" in output
```

### Fallback Strategy

```python
def apply_ignored_hunks(self, ignored_mappings: List[HunkTargetMapping]) -> bool:
    \"\"\"Apply hunks with worktree if available, fallback to index approach.\"\"\"
    
    if self._check_worktree_support():
        self.logger.debug("Using git worktree approach for hunk processing")
        return self._apply_with_worktree(ignored_mappings)
    else:
        self.logger.debug("Falling back to index-based approach")
        return self._apply_with_index(ignored_mappings)
```

## Recommendation

The git worktree approach offers significant advantages:

1. **Complete Isolation**: No interference with main repository state
2. **Simplified Implementation**: Fewer state management concerns  
3. **Better Error Handling**: Atomic cleanup via worktree removal
4. **Future Extensibility**: Foundation for parallel processing

### Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Implement worktree-based handler alongside current approach
2. **Phase 2**: Add feature flag for selecting approach  
3. **Phase 3**: Performance testing and validation
4. **Phase 4**: Gradual migration with fallback support
5. **Phase 5**: Full replacement after validation period

The worktree approach represents a significant improvement in architecture while maintaining the security and reliability benefits of the current git-native implementation.
