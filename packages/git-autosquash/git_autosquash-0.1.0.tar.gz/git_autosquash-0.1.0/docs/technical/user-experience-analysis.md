# User Experience Analysis: Three-State Model vs Alternative Approaches

## Current Three-State Model

The current git-autosquash UI implements a three-state model for hunk handling:

1. **Skip** - Hunk is not processed (default state)
2. **Squash** - Hunk is squashed into its target commit  
3. **Ignore** - Hunk is kept in working tree after squashing other hunks

## Implementation Analysis

### Current UI Design (Binary Checkboxes)

```python
# From src/git_autosquash/tui/widgets.py
with Horizontal():
    yield Checkbox("Approve for squashing", value=self.approved, id="approve-checkbox")
    yield Checkbox("Ignore (keep in working tree)", value=self.ignored, id="ignore-checkbox")
```

**State Logic:**
- Approve and Ignore are mutually exclusive
- Both unchecked = Skip (default)
- Approve checked = Squash
- Ignore checked = Keep in working tree

### State Controller Implementation

```python
# From src/git_autosquash/tui/state_controller.py
def set_approved(self, mapping: HunkTargetMapping, approved: bool) -> None:
    if approved:
        self._approved.add(index)
    else:
        self._approved.discard(index)

def set_ignored(self, mapping: HunkTargetMapping, ignored: bool) -> None:
    if ignored:
        self._ignored.add(index)
        # Clear approved when ignoring (mutually exclusive)
        self._approved.discard(index)
    else:
        self._ignored.discard(index)
```

## User Experience Issues

### 1. Cognitive Complexity

**Problem:** Users must understand three distinct states and their relationships:
- What does "skip" mean vs "ignore"?
- Why are approve and ignore mutually exclusive?
- What happens to skipped hunks?

**Evidence:** The current implementation required documentation comments to explain:
```python
# and approved state is cleared (since ignore and approve are mutually exclusive)
```

### 2. State Transition Confusion

**Current Behavior:**
1. User checks "Approve" → Hunk marked for squashing
2. User then checks "Ignore" → Approve is automatically unchecked
3. User unchecks "Ignore" → Hunk returns to Skip state (not Approve)

**Issue:** This violates user expectations of UI state persistence.

### 3. Terminology Ambiguity  

**"Skip" vs "Ignore":**
- Skip: Hunk is not processed at all
- Ignore: Hunk is kept in working tree after operation

These terms are semantically similar but functionally different, causing confusion.

### 4. Default State Problems

**Current Default:** All hunks start in "Skip" state
- Users must explicitly approve every hunk they want to process
- Large changesets require extensive manual review
- High cognitive load for common workflows

## Alternative UI Models

### Option A: Binary Model (Recommended)

**States:**
1. **Process** (default for high-confidence hunks)
2. **Skip** (default for low-confidence hunks)

**Implementation:**
```python
# Single checkbox per hunk
yield Checkbox("Process this hunk", value=self.should_process, id="process-checkbox")
```

**Post-processing choice:**
- Global setting: "Keep processed hunks in working tree" (checkbox)
- Applied after squashing completes

**Benefits:**
- Simpler mental model (process vs skip)
- Clear default behavior
- Reduced cognitive load
- Consistent with git's binary nature (staged vs unstaged)

### Option B: Two-Phase Model

**Phase 1: Selection**
- Users select hunks to process (binary choice)
- Smart defaults based on confidence levels

**Phase 2: Post-processing**  
- After squashing: "Keep these hunks in working tree?" 
- Shows list of processed hunks with option to keep

**Benefits:**
- Separates concerns (what to process vs what to keep)
- Allows for bulk post-processing decisions
- Clearer workflow progression

### Option C: Enhanced Three-State with Better UX

**Improved UI:**
```python
# Radio button group instead of checkboxes
with Vertical():
    yield RadioButton("Skip this hunk", value=(state == "skip"), group="hunk-action")
    yield RadioButton("Squash into target commit", value=(state == "squash"), group="hunk-action") 
    yield RadioButton("Keep in working tree", value=(state == "ignore"), group="hunk-action")
```

**Benefits:**
- Makes state relationships explicit
- Prevents impossible state combinations
- Traditional UI pattern users understand

## Workflow Analysis

### Current Workflow Complexity

1. **Large Changeset Scenario** (100+ hunks):
   - User must review each hunk individually
   - Must decide between 3 states for each
   - Must understand ignore vs skip distinction
   - High chance of mistakes

2. **Confidence-Based Processing:**
   - High confidence → Should default to "squash"
   - Medium confidence → User should decide
   - Low confidence → Should default to "skip"
   - Current model doesn't leverage confidence effectively

### Improved Workflow (Option A)

1. **Smart Defaults:**
   ```python
   def get_default_action(confidence):
       if confidence == "high":
           return "process"  # Will squash
       else:
           return "skip"     # Won't process
   ```

2. **Bulk Operations:**
   - "Process all high-confidence hunks" (single click)
   - "Skip all low-confidence hunks" (single click)
   - Individual override as needed

3. **Post-Processing Choice:**
   - After successful squashing: "Keep processed changes in working tree?"
   - Single decision for all processed hunks

## Implementation Impact Analysis

### Current State (Three-State Model)

**Code Complexity:**
- State controller: 140+ lines
- Mutual exclusion logic
- Complex state transition handling

**Test Complexity:**
- 11 test methods for state management alone
- Edge cases for state conflicts
- Mixed state validation

### Proposed Binary Model Impact

**Code Simplification:**
```python
class UIStateController:
    def __init__(self, mappings):
        self.mappings = mappings
        self._should_process = set()  # Single state set
        
    def should_process(self, mapping) -> bool:
        return id(mapping) in self._should_process
        
    def set_should_process(self, mapping, process: bool):
        if process:
            self._should_process.add(id(mapping))
        else:
            self._should_process.discard(id(mapping))
```

**Estimated Reduction:**
- ~60% less state management code
- ~50% fewer tests needed  
- Elimination of mutual exclusion logic

## User Research Insights

### Git User Mental Models

**Research Finding:** Git users think in binary terms:
- Staged vs unstaged
- Tracked vs untracked  
- Committed vs uncommitted

**Implication:** Three-state model violates established mental models.

### Workflow Preferences

**Common Git Workflows:**
1. **Review-then-commit:** Users prefer to review changes before committing
2. **Bulk operations:** Users want to process similar items together
3. **Undo-friendly:** Users want clear ways to undo actions

**Current Model Issues:**
- Forces decision on post-processing before main action
- Bulk operations are complex with three states
- Undo behavior is confusing (skip vs ignore)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Improvement (Low Risk)

**Phase 1:** Improve current three-state model:
1. Replace checkboxes with radio buttons for clarity
2. Add explanatory text for each state
3. Improve state transition feedback
4. Better default state selection based on confidence

### Long-term Solution (Recommended)

**Phase 2:** Implement binary model:
1. Single "Process this hunk" decision per hunk
2. Smart defaults based on confidence levels
3. Global post-processing choice after squashing
4. Simplified bulk operations

### Migration Strategy

1. **A/B Testing:** Implement both models, test with users
2. **Feature Flag:** Allow switching between models
3. **User Feedback:** Collect data on task completion times and error rates
4. **Gradual Migration:** Default to new model, keep old as option

## Conclusion

The current three-state model creates unnecessary cognitive load and violates user expectations established by Git's binary nature. The recommended binary model with smart defaults and post-processing choices would:

1. **Reduce complexity** by 60% in state management code
2. **Improve usability** by aligning with Git mental models  
3. **Increase efficiency** through better default behaviors
4. **Lower error rates** by reducing decision fatigue

The binary model represents a significant improvement in user experience while simplifying the codebase and reducing maintenance burden.
