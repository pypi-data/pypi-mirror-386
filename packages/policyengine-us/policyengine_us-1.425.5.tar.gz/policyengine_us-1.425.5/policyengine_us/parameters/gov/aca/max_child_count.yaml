      # The above reference includes the following text:
      #   When a policy includes more than 3 children such that some children
      #   are not rated, the PUF logic distributes the total child rate for 3
      #   children among all children younger than 21 years-old (e.g., if the
      #   policy includes 4 children, each with a rate of $100, the
      #   policy-level premium is $300 and each childâ€™s calculated premium
      #   for the PUF is $75).
