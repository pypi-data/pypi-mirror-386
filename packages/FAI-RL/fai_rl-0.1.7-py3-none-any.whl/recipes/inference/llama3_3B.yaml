# Inference Configuration for Local Fine-tuned Model
# This config runs inference on a local fine-tuned model checkpoint.
# Use this after training a model with the FAI-RL framework.

inference:
  # Model Configuration - Option A: Local Fine-tuned Model
  # Path to local fine-tuned model checkpoint (use this for models trained with this framework)
  model_path: "models/llama3_3B_Inst_SFT_lora_v1/checkpoint-100"
  
  # Path to save inference results (CSV format with input columns + response column)
  output_file: "outputs/llama3_3B_Inst_SFT_lora_v1_checkpoint100_inference.csv"
  
  # Dataset Configuration
  # Specifies which dataset to run inference on
  dataset_name: "Roblox/FAI-RL-inference-dataset"  # HuggingFace dataset identifier (e.g., "Anthropic/hh-rlhf")
  dataset_split: "test"                            # Dataset split to use: train, test, or validation
  dataset_columns: ["persona", "prompt"]           # List of columns to concatenate as model input
  response_column: "response"                      # Name of column to store model responses (default: "response")
  
  # System Prompt
  # Provides context and instructions to the model for generation
  # Multi-line system message that defines the model's behavior and task

    Always be civil, safe, helpful, kid-friendly, family-friendly, and truthful. Respect the community and engage with a professional, neutral tone. Responses must be informative and under 120 words.
    
    **Behavioral Rules:**
    - Never use emojis unless explicitly asked to.
    - Do not use LaTeX formatting; use basic Markdown only.
    - Do not repeat text or make up factual information.
    - Do not ask for permission to generate content â€” just do it.

  # Generation Parameters
  # Controls the randomness and quality of generated text
  # Tips: For consistent results, use temperature: 0.0 and do_sample: false
  #       For creative generation, use temperature: 0.8-1.2 with top_p: 0.9
  temperature: 1.0            # Sampling temperature (0.0 = deterministic, 2.0 = very random)
  top_p: 0.9                  # Nucleus sampling threshold (0.0-1.0, lower = more focused)
  max_new_tokens: 1000        # Maximum number of tokens to generate per response
  do_sample: true             # Enable sampling (false = greedy decoding, true = stochastic sampling)
