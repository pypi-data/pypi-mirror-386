# Inference Configuration for API-based Models
# This config runs inference using an API endpoint (e.g., OpenAI, hosted LLM).
# Use this for commercial models or hosted endpoints without local model files.
# 
# Usage: Replace <YOUR_API_ENDPOINT> and <YOUR_API_KEY> with your actual API credentials

inference:
  # Model Configuration - Option C: API-based Inference
  # For API-based inference, provide model identifier, API key, and endpoint
  api_endpoint: "https://<YOUR_API_ENDPOINT>"        # Custom API endpoint URL for hosted model
  api_key: "<YOUR_API_KEY>"                          # API authentication key (e.g., OpenAI API key)
  model: "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct"          # API model identifier (format depends on API provider)
  
  # Path to save inference results (CSV format with input columns + response column)
  output_file: "outputs/llama3-3B-FAI-RL-inference-dataset-output-api.csv"
  
  # Dataset Configuration
  # Specifies which dataset to run inference on
  dataset_name: "Roblox/FAI-RL-inference-dataset"  # HuggingFace dataset identifier (e.g., "Anthropic/hh-rlhf")
  dataset_split: "test"                            # Dataset split to use: train, test, or validation
  dataset_columns: ["persona", "prompt"]           # List of columns to concatenate as model input
  response_column: "response"                      # Name of column to store model responses (default: "response")
  
  # System Prompt
  # Provides context and instructions to the model for generation
  # Multi-line system message that defines the model's behavior and task

    Always be civil, safe, helpful, kid-friendly, family-friendly, and truthful. Respect the community and engage with a professional, neutral tone. Responses must be informative and under 120 words.
    
    **Behavioral Rules:**
    - Never use emojis unless explicitly asked to.
    - Do not use LaTeX formatting; use basic Markdown only.
    - Do not repeat text or make up factual information.
    - Do not ask for permission to generate content â€” just do it.
    
    **Adhere to Roblox's Community Standards**, which prohibit:

    - Profanity in any language.
    - Political content, including figures and entities.
    - Cheating, scams, exploits, spam, and misleading content.
    
    **Security and Privacy Rules:**
    - Never disclose or request personal identifiable information.
    - Do not generate or allow off-platform links except to YouTube, Facebook, Discord, X (Twitter), Guilded, and Twitch.
    - Do not bypass safety systems.
    - Do not transliterate or translate inappropriate content through other languages.
    
    Your primary goals:
    - Provide helpful and factual responses.
    - Avoid harmful, biased, or unethical suggestions.
    - Respect user privacy and confidentiality.

  # Generation Parameters
  # Controls the randomness and quality of generated text
  # Tips: For consistent results, use temperature: 0.0 and do_sample: false
  #       For creative generation, use temperature: 0.8-1.2 with top_p: 0.9
  temperature: 1.0            # Sampling temperature (0.0 = deterministic, 2.0 = very random)
  top_p: 0.9                  # Nucleus sampling threshold (0.0-1.0, lower = more focused)
  max_new_tokens: 1000        # Maximum number of tokens to generate per response
  do_sample: true             # Enable sampling (false = greedy decoding, true = stochastic sampling)
