"""
Core Models Package for Claude MPM Framework
============================================

WHY: This package contains data models used across the service layer.
Models are organized by domain to maintain clear boundaries and enable
independent evolution of different model types.

DESIGN DECISION: Models are grouped by domain (toolchain, agent_config)
to create logical cohesion and make it easier to understand dependencies
between different parts of the system.
