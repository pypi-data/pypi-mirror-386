"""
Process Management Interfaces for Claude MPM Framework
=======================================================

WHY: This module defines interfaces for local process management operations,
enabling the local-ops-agent to spawn, track, and manage background processes
with proper isolation, state persistence, and port conflict prevention.

DESIGN DECISION: Process management interfaces are separated from other service
interfaces to maintain clear boundaries between deployment operations and other
system services.

ARCHITECTURE:
- ILocalProcessManager: Core interface for process lifecycle management
- IDeploymentStateManager: Interface for persistent state tracking
- Process data models defined in models/process.py

USAGE:
    state_manager = DeploymentStateManager(state_file_path)
    process_manager = LocalProcessManager(state_manager)

    config = StartConfig(
        command=["npm", "run", "dev"],
        working_directory="/path/to/project",
        port=3000
    )

    deployment = await process_manager.start(config)
    print(f"Started process {deployment.process_id} on port {deployment.port}")

    Interface for deployment state persistence and management.

    WHY: State persistence is critical for tracking processes across restarts
    and preventing orphaned processes. This interface abstracts the storage
    mechanism to enable different backends (JSON file, database, etc.).

    DESIGN DECISION: Provides both low-level (save/load) and high-level (query)
    operations to support different use cases. Uses file locking to prevent
    corruption from concurrent access.

    Thread Safety: All operations must be thread-safe with proper locking.
