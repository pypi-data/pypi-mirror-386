"""Deployment pipeline for agent deployment.

This module provides a pipeline-based approach to agent deployment,
breaking down the complex deployment process into discrete, testable steps.

The pipeline pattern allows for:
- Modular deployment steps that can be tested independently
- Configurable deployment flows for different scenarios
- Easy addition of new deployment steps
- Better error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive logging and metrics collection
