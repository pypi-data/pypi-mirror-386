# Agent Memories Directory

This directory contains memory files for various agents used in the project.

## File Format

Memory files follow the naming convention: `{agent_id}_memories.md`

Each file contains:
- Agent metadata (name, type, version)
- Project-specific learnings organized by category
- Timestamps for tracking updates

## Auto-generated

These files are managed automatically by the agent memory system.
Manual edits should be done carefully to preserve the format.
