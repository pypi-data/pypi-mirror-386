"""Deployment strategy pattern for agent deployment.

This module provides different deployment strategies for various scenarios:
- SystemAgentDeploymentStrategy: For system-wide agent deployment
- ProjectAgentDeploymentStrategy: For project-specific agent deployment
- UserAgentDeploymentStrategy: For user-specific agent deployment

The strategy pattern allows for clean separation of deployment logic
and makes it easy to add new deployment types in the future.
