Users don't understand core value proposition (6/10 interviews)\n2. Setup process too complex (8/10 interviews)\n3. Missing key integrations (4/10 interviews)\n4. No clear path to advanced features (5/10 interviews)\n\n**Solutions to Test** (prioritized by assumptions):\n- Opportunity #2 (Setup complexity):\n  - \u2705 Interactive setup wizard (testing this week)\n  - Bulk import from existing tools\n  - Setup templates for common use cases\n  \n- Opportunity #1 (Value proposition):\n  - Value demonstration on landing page\n  - Interactive product tour\n  - Email sequence highlighting key benefits\n\n### This Week's Experiments\n1. **Assumption**: Interactive wizard reduces setup time by 50%\n   - **Test**: A/B test wizard vs current flow (100 users each)\n   - **Success Criteria**: Setup completion >70%, time <5min\n   - **Interview Questions**: \"How did you feel during setup?\", \"What was confusing?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Outcome-Focused PRD\n```markdown\n# PRD: Smart Recommendations Feature\n\n## Problem Statement (JTBD)\nWhen users browse our product catalog, they want to discover relevant items quickly, so they can make purchase decisions without extensive searching and feel confident in their choices.\n\n**Evidence**:\n- 68% of users browse >3 categories before purchasing (analytics)\n- Average session time: 12 minutes (high engagement but low conversion)\n- User interviews (n=15): \"Too many options, hard to find what I need\"\n- Competitor analysis: 4/5 competitors have recommendations\n\n## Success Metrics\n**Primary (North Star Impact)**:\n- Increase conversion rate from 2.3% to 3.5% (+52% lift)\n- Increase average order value from $45 to $55 (+22%)\n\n**Secondary**:\n- 40% of purchases include recommended item\n- Reduce time-to-purchase from 12min to 8min\n- Recommendation click-through rate >15%\n\n## User Stories\n\n### Epic: Personalized Product Discovery\n\n**Story 1**: Browse Page Recommendations\nAs a shopper, I want to see products similar to what I'm viewing, so I can discover alternatives without searching.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- GIVEN I'm viewing a product page\n- WHEN I scroll to recommendations section\n- THEN I see 4-6 relevant products based on: category, price range, user preferences\n- AND recommendations update based on my browsing behavior\n\n**Story 2**: Cart Recommendations\nAs a shopper, I want to see complementary products when reviewing my cart, so I can complete my purchase with everything I need.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- GIVEN I have items in cart\n- WHEN I view cart page\n- THEN I see 3-4 complementary products (\"Frequently Bought Together\")\n- AND I can add items to cart with single click\n\n## Non-Goals\n- Admin-configurable recommendation rules (v2)\n- Cross-category recommendations (v2)\n- Personalization based on purchase history (requires ML infra)\n\n## Open Questions & Risks\n\n**Risks**:\n- **Technical**: ML model accuracy <70% \u2192 Mitigation: Start with rule-based, iterate to ML\n- **Business**: Revenue cannibalization \u2192 Mitigation: Track net new vs substitution\n- **User**: Recommendation fatigue \u2192 Mitigation: A/B test placement and quantity\n\n**Open Questions**:\n1. What recommendation algorithm? (Rule-based vs collaborative filtering)\n2. How many recommendations optimal? (Test: 3, 6, 9)\n3. Placement on page? (Above fold vs below product details)\n\n## Go-to-Market\n- **Launch**: Phased rollout (10% \u2192 50% \u2192 100% over 2 weeks)\n- **Marketing**: Email announcement, blog post on personalization\n- **Support**: FAQ, tooltip explanations, feedback mechanism\n- **Analytics**: Dashboard for recommendation performance, A/B test results\n```\n\n### 5. Stakeholder Alignment (Feature Proposal)\n```markdown\n# One-Pager: Advanced Analytics Dashboard\n\n## Problem\nPower users (25% of user base, 60% of revenue) struggle to extract insights from their data, requiring manual exports and external tools. This friction is cited as #2 reason for churn in exit interviews.\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Churn interviews: 12/20 enterprise churns mentioned analytics limitations\n- Feature requests: #1 requested feature (87 requests in 6 months)\n- Competitive gap: All 4 major competitors offer advanced analytics\n- Customer Advisory Board: Top priority in Q1 2025 survey\n\n## Proposed Solution\nIn-app analytics dashboard with:\n- Custom report builder (drag-and-drop)\n- Data visualization library (10+ chart types)\n- Scheduled reports and exports\n- Team sharing and collaboration\n\n## Success Metrics\n**Business Impact**:\n- Reduce enterprise churn by 15% (from 20% to 17% annually)\n- Increase expansion revenue by $200K ARR (25% of power users upgrade)\n- Improve NPS for power users by 10 points (currently 42)\n\n**Product Metrics**:\n- 60% of power users adopt dashboard within 30 days\n- Average 5 custom reports created per user\n- 30% of teams share reports weekly\n\n## Risks & Mitigation\n- **Risk**: Low adoption \u2192 **Mitigation**: Onboarding flow, templates, email sequence\n- **Risk**: Performance with large datasets \u2192 **Mitigation**: Query optimization, pagination, caching\n- **Risk**: Feature bloat \u2192 **Mitigation**: Start with MVP (5 chart types), iterate based on usage\n\n## Resources Needed\n- Engineering: 2 engineers \u00d7 8 weeks (16 engineer-weeks)\n- Design: 1 designer \u00d7 4 weeks (4 design-weeks)\n- PM: 1 PM \u00d7 10 weeks (ongoing)\n- Total Effort: ~5 person-months\n\n**RICE Score**: (500 users \u00d7 3.0 impact \u00d7 0.9 confidence) \u00f7 5 effort = **270**\n\n## Timeline\n- **Now** (Q2): Discovery & validation (4 weeks)\n- **Next** (Q3): MVP development (8 weeks)\n- **Later** (Q4): Iteration based on feedback, advanced features\n\n## Decision Needed\nApprove for Q2 discovery phase? (Recommendation: Yes - High RICE, strong evidence, strategic priority)\n```\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. HiPPO Decision-Making\n```markdown\n\u274c WRONG: \"The CEO wants feature X, let's build it.\"\n\n\u2705 CORRECT: \"The CEO suggested feature X. Let me:\n1. Understand the underlying problem/opportunity\n2. Gather user evidence (interviews, data)\n3. Evaluate with RICE framework\n4. Propose solution with evidence\n5. Align on success metrics before building\"\n```\n\n### 2. Output Focus (Feature Factory)\n```markdown\n\u274c WRONG:\n**Goal**: Ship 5 new features this quarter\n**Roadmap**: Feature A, Feature B, Feature C, Feature D, Feature E\n\n\u2705 CORRECT:\n**Outcome**: Increase user activation from 35% to 50%\n**Key Results**: \n- Day 7 retention: 35% \u2192 50%\n- Time-to-first-value: 15min \u2192 5min\n- Onboarding completion: 45% \u2192 70%\n**Initiatives**: Test solutions to achieve outcomes (features are experiments)\n```\n\n### 3. Waterfall Roadmaps (Fixed Features & Dates)\n```markdown\n\u274c WRONG:\n**Q2 Roadmap**:\n- April: Feature A (3 weeks)\n- May: Feature B (4 weeks)\n- June: Feature C (3 weeks)\n(Commits to solutions and timeline without validation)\n\n\u2705 CORRECT:\n**Q2 Roadmap (Now-Next-Later)**:\n**Now** (High Confidence - 80%+):\n- Improve onboarding flow (outcome: 50% Day 7 retention)\n- Setup wizard (current solution, may iterate)\n\n**Next** (Medium Confidence - 60%+):\n- Activation email sequence\n- In-app guidance system\n(Solutions may change based on discovery)\n\n**Later** (Exploratory - <50%):\n- AI-powered recommendations\n- Community features\n(Directional - will validate and refine)\n```\n\n### 4. No User Contact (Ivory Tower Product)\n```markdown\n\u274c WRONG:\n- Prioritize based on analytics and stakeholder input only\n- Quarterly user research \"when we have time\"\n- Surveys and NPS as primary feedback mechanism\n\n\u2705 CORRECT (Continuous Discovery):\n- Weekly user interviews/tests (product trio)\n- Talk to 3-5 users per week minimum\n- Mix of methods: interviews, usability tests, prototype validation\n- Synthesize learnings weekly\n- Update opportunity solution tree continuously\n```\n\n### 5. No Evidence Requirement\n```markdown\n\u274c WRONG:\n**Feature Proposal**: \"We should build X because:\n- It seems like a good idea\n- Users have mentioned it\n- Competitors have it\n- It's technically interesting\"\n\n\u2705 CORRECT:\n**Feature Proposal**: \"We should prioritize X because:\n- **User Evidence**: 15/20 interviews mentioned this pain point\n- **Data Evidence**: 45% drop-off at this step (analytics)\n- **Market Evidence**: All 4 competitors have this, cited in 6 lost deals\n- **Business Evidence**: Projected $100K ARR impact, 8% churn reduction\n- **RICE Score**: 285 (top 3 in backlog)\n- **Confidence**: 85% based on strong evidence across sources\"\n```\n\n### 6. Solution-First Thinking\n```markdown\n\u274c WRONG:\n**Request**: \"We need a chatbot!\"\n**Response**: \"Great idea! Let's spec it out and build it.\"\n\n\u2705 CORRECT:\n**Request**: \"We need a chatbot!\"\n**Response**: \"Interesting! What problem are you trying to solve?\"\n\u2192 Discovery: Users can't find help documentation quickly\n\u2192 JTBD: \"When I have a question, I want instant answers, so I can complete my task without delay\"\n\u2192 Solutions to test:\n  1. Improved search in help center\n  2. Contextual help tooltips\n  3. AI chatbot\n  4. Live chat with support\n\u2192 Evaluate options with RICE, test assumptions\n```\n\n### 7. Ignoring Context (One-Size-Fits-All)\n```markdown\n\u274c WRONG:\n\"Always use RICE for prioritization\" (regardless of context)\n\n\u2705 CORRECT (Context-Aware):\n- **Early-stage product**: Use ICE (faster, encourages experimentation)\n- **Growth stage**: Use RICE (balances impact with effort)\n- **Enterprise B2B**: Use WSJF (accounts for urgency and risk)\n- **Technical debt**: Use Value vs
