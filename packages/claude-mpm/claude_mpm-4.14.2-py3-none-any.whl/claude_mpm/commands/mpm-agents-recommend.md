# Show recommended agents for detected project stack

Get intelligent agent recommendations based on your project's detected toolchain.

## Usage

```
/mpm-agents-recommend
```

## Description

This command analyzes your detected project stack and recommends the most appropriate agents, organized by priority:
- **Essential agents**: Core agents required for your primary stack
- **Recommended agents**: Complementary agents for full functionality
- **Optional agents**: Specialized agents for detected tools

Each recommendation includes an explanation of why that agent is suggested.

## Implementation

When you run `/mpm-agents-recommend`, the PM will execute:
```bash
claude-mpm agents recommend
```

This runs the detection phase and then applies recommendation rules to suggest the best agents for your specific technology stack.

## Expected Output

```
ðŸ¤– Agent Recommendations
=========================

Based on detected stack:
  Python 3.11, FastAPI 0.104.0, pytest, Docker, Vercel

Essential Agents (Must Have):
  âœ“ fastapi-engineer
    Reason: FastAPI framework detected - specialized agent for FastAPI development
    Capabilities: FastAPI routes, Pydantic models, async endpoints, dependency injection

  âœ“ python-engineer
    Reason: Python project - general Python development support
    Capabilities: Python code, testing, debugging, package management

  âœ“ api-qa
    Reason: API testing for FastAPI backend
    Capabilities: API endpoint testing, validation, load testing, contract testing

Recommended Agents (Strongly Suggested):
  â—‹ docker-ops
    Reason: Docker configuration detected
    Capabilities: Docker builds, container management, docker-compose orchestration

  â—‹ vercel-ops
    Reason: Vercel deployment configuration found
    Capabilities: Vercel deployments, serverless functions, domain management

  â—‹ playwright-qa
    Reason: Comprehensive E2E testing capability
    Capabilities: Browser automation, visual testing, API testing

Optional Agents (Nice to Have):
  â—‹ local-ops-agent
    Reason: Local development and PM2 process management
    Capabilities: Local server management, port handling, PM2 operations

  â—‹ security-agent
    Reason: Security scanning and best practices
    Capabilities: Dependency scanning, code security, auth patterns

Summary:
  Recommended: 3 essential + 2 recommended = 5 agents
  Optional: 2 additional agents for enhanced capabilities

  Total recommended deployment: 5 agents
  Maximum useful deployment: 7 agents

Next Steps:
  1. Review recommendations above
  2. Run '/mpm-auto-configure --preview' to see deployment plan
  3. Run '/mpm-auto-configure' to deploy recommended agents
  4. Or deploy individually: '/mpm-agents deploy <agent-name>'
```

## Use Cases

1. **Planning**: Understand what agents you should deploy before starting work
2. **Validation**: Verify that auto-configuration will suggest the right agents
3. **Learning**: Discover what capabilities are available for your stack
4. **Optimization**: Find additional agents that could enhance your workflow

## Tips

1. **Start here**: Run this before `/mpm-auto-configure` to preview recommendations
2. **Essential vs Optional**: Focus on essential agents first, add others as needed
3. **Stack-specific**: Recommendations are tailored to YOUR detected stack
4. **Flexible**: You can always deploy additional agents later or skip some
5. **Explanations**: Pay attention to the "Reason" for each recommendation

## Customizing Recommendations

After seeing recommendations, you can:
1. **Accept all**: Run `/mpm-auto-configure` to deploy all recommended agents
2. **Pick and choose**: Deploy specific agents with `/mpm-agents deploy <name>`
3. **Skip optional**: Deploy only essential and recommended agents
4. **Add more**: Deploy additional agents not in recommendations
