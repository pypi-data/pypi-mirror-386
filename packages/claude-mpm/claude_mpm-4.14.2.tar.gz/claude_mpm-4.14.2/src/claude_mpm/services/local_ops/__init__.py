"""
Local Operations Service Package
=================================

WHY: Provides process management and health monitoring capabilities for local
development deployments. This package implements the core infrastructure needed
by the local-ops-agent to spawn, track, manage, and monitor background processes.

DESIGN DECISION: Organized as a service package under services/ to integrate
with the existing service architecture and dependency injection system.

ARCHITECTURE:
- StateManager: Persistent deployment state tracking
- ProcessManager: Process lifecycle management with isolation
- HealthCheckManager: Three-tier health monitoring (HTTP, process, resource)
- HealthChecks: HTTP, process, and resource health check implementations
- CrashDetector: Crash detection via health status monitoring
- RestartPolicy: Intelligent restart policies with exponential backoff
- RestartManager: Auto-restart orchestration with circuit breaker
- MemoryLeakDetector: Proactive memory leak detection using trend analysis
- LogMonitor: Real-time log file monitoring for error patterns
- ResourceMonitor: Comprehensive resource exhaustion prevention
- Data Models: Process status, deployment state, health status, restart history,
              stability metrics (memory trends, log matches, resource usage)
- Interfaces: ILocalProcessManager, IDeploymentStateManager, IHealthCheckManager,
             ICrashDetector, IRestartPolicy, IRestartManager, IMemoryLeakDetector,
             ILogMonitor, IResourceMonitor

USAGE:
    from claude_mpm.services.local_ops import (
        LocalProcessManager,
        DeploymentStateManager,
        HealthCheckManager,
        StartConfig,
        ProcessStatus,
        HealthStatus,
    )

    # Initialize managers
    state_manager = DeploymentStateManager(".claude-mpm/deployment-state.json")
    process_manager = LocalProcessManager(state_manager)
    health_manager = HealthCheckManager(process_manager, check_interval=30)

    # Start a process
    config = StartConfig(
        command=["npm", "run", "dev"],
        working_directory="/path/to/project",
        port=3000
    )
    deployment = process_manager.start(config)

    # Check health
    health = health_manager.check_health(deployment.deployment_id)

    # Start background monitoring
    health_manager.start_monitoring()
