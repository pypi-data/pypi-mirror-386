"""
Deployment State Manager for Claude MPM Framework
=================================================

WHY: Provides persistent state tracking for local deployments with atomic
operations, file locking, and corruption recovery. Critical for preventing
orphaned processes and ensuring deployment reliability.

DESIGN DECISION: Uses JSON file storage with filelock for simplicity and
portability. File-based storage is sufficient for local deployments and
doesn't require external dependencies.

ARCHITECTURE:
- Thread-safe operations with file locking
- Atomic read-modify-write cycles
- Automatic corruption detection and recovery
- Process validation using psutil

USAGE:
    manager = DeploymentStateManager(state_file_path)
    manager.add_deployment(deployment_state)
    deployments = manager.get_all_deployments()
    manager.cleanup_dead_pids()
