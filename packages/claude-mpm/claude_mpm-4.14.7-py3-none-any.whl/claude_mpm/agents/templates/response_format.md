**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-21
**Parent Document**: [PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md](../PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Overview

PM responses must follow a structured JSON format to ensure:
- **Complete delegation tracking**: All delegated tasks and agents used
- **Evidence-based assertions**: Every claim backed by verification
- **File tracking accountability**: All new files tracked in git with context
- **Measurable outcomes**: Concrete, verifiable results
- **Actionable next steps**: Clear path forward if work is incomplete

**Required Structure**: All PM session summaries MUST be JSON-structured with the fields defined in the schema below.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Vague Verification Evidence
**WRONG**:
```
"verification_evidence": "It works correctly"
```
*Problem: No actual evidence provided*

‚úÖ **CORRECT**:
```
"verification_evidence": "GET /api/users: HTTP 200 OK, returned 15 user records"
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Unverified Assertions
**WRONG**:
```
"assertions_made": {
  "API deployed": "Should be working"
}
```
*Problem: No verification, just assumption*

‚úÖ **CORRECT**:
```
"assertions_made": {
  "API deployed": "vercel-ops-agent verified with curl - HTTP 200 response from https://api.vercel.app"
}
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Missing File Tracking
**WRONG**:
```
"file_tracking": {
  "new_files_created": [],
  "files_tracked_in_git": false,
  "commits_made": [],
  "untracked_files_remaining": ["/src/new_feature.py"]
}
```
*Problem: Files created but not tracked - VIOLATION!*

‚úÖ **CORRECT**:
```
"file_tracking": {
  "new_files_created": ["/src/new_feature.py"],
  "files_tracked_in_git": true,
  "commits_made": ["a1b2c3d: feat: add new feature implementation"],
  "untracked_files_remaining": []
}
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Generic Task Delegation
**WRONG**:
```
"tasks_delegated": ["Engineer: do the thing"]
```
*Problem: Not specific enough*

‚úÖ **CORRECT**:
```
"tasks_delegated": ["python-engineer: Implement user authentication with JWT tokens and bcrypt password hashing"]
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 5: Relative File Paths
**WRONG**:
```
"new_files_created": ["src/auth.py"]
```
*Problem: Relative path instead of absolute*

‚úÖ **CORRECT**:
```
"new_files_created": ["/Users/project/src/auth.py"]
```

## Integration with Other Systems

### TodoWrite Integration
The PM response format works in conjunction with TodoWrite tracking:
- `tasks_delegated` should match TodoWrite task list
- `delegation_summary.violations_detected` counts violations logged in TodoWrite
- Task completion status should align with `implementation.status`

### Violation Tracking Integration
The response format captures violations for accountability:
- `violations_detected`: Integer count of PM violations
- Circuit breakers (see [Circuit Breakers](circuit_breakers.md)) detect violations
- Violations escalate based on count (1 = warning, 2 = critical, 3+ = session compromised)

### Git File Tracking Integration
The `file_tracking` object enforces the [Git File Tracking Protocol](git_file_tracking.md):
- PM must run `git status` before ending sessions
- All new files must be tracked (unless in .gitignore or /tmp/)
- Commits must use Claude MPM branding in commit messages
- Circuit Breaker #5 detects file tracking violations

### Evidence Collection Integration
The `verification_results` object supports the [Validation Templates](validation_templates.md):
- `qa_tests_run` enforces mandatory QA requirement
- `verification_evidence` must contain actual data (see Required Evidence table)
- `qa_agent_used` tracks which specialized agent performed verification
- PM cannot claim work complete without evidence

## Notes

- This document is extracted from PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md for better organization
- All PM responses MUST follow this JSON schema
- Validation occurs at multiple levels: structure, data types, content quality
- Integration with TodoWrite, violation tracking, and git file tracking is mandatory
- Updates to response format should be made here and referenced in PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md
