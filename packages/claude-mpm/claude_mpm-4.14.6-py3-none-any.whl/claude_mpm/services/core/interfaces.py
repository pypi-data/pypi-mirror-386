"""
Core Service Interfaces for Claude MPM Framework
===============================================

WHY: This module provides backward compatibility for the modular interface
structure. The original 1,437-line monolithic file has been split into
focused modules in the interfaces/ package.

DESIGN DECISION: We maintain this file for backward compatibility while the actual
interface definitions have been moved to interfaces/ modules for better organization.

REFACTORING NOTE: The original interfaces.py file has been split into:
- interfaces/infrastructure.py: Core framework services (DI, config, caching, health)
- interfaces/agent.py: Agent management, deployment, and capabilities
- interfaces/service.py: Business services (memory, hooks, utilities)
- interfaces/communication.py: External communication (WebSocket, project analysis, tickets)

IMPACT: Reduced from 1,437 lines to ~50 lines, with functionality split across
focused modules for better maintainability and testing.

# Re-export everything from the new modular structure for backward compatibility
from .interfaces import *

# All interface definitions have been moved to the interfaces/ package
# This file now serves as a compatibility layer that delegates to the modular structure
