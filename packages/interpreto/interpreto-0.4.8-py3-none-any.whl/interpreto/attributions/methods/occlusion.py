    The Occlusion method is a perturbation-based approach to interpret model behavior by analyzing
    the impact of removing or masking parts of the input text. The principle is simple: by
    systematically occluding (i.e., masking, deleting, or replacing) specific tokens or spans in the
    input and observing how the model's output changes, one can infer the relative importance of
    each part of the input to the model's behavior.
