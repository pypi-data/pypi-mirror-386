        Generates a binary mask for each token in the sequence.

        The perturbed instances are sampled that way:
         - We choose a number of selected features k, considering the distribution
                p(k) = (nb_features - 1) / (k * (nb_features - k))
            where nb_features is the total number of features in the interpretable space
         - Then we randomly select a binary vector with k ones, all the possible sample
           are equally likely. It is done by generating a random vector with values drawn
           from a normal distribution and keeping the top k elements which then will be 1
           and other values are 0.
         Since there are nb_features choose k vectors with k ones, this weighted sampling
         is equivalent to applying the Shapley kernel for the sample weight, defined as:
            k(nb_features, k) = (nb_features - 1)/(k*(nb_features - k)*(nb_features choose k))
        This trick is the one used in the Captum library: https://github.com/pytorch/captum
