    KernelSHAP is a model‑agnostic Shapley value estimator that interprets predictions
    by computing Shapley values through a weighted linear regression in the space of
    feature coalitions.

    By unifying ideas from LIME and Shapley value theory, KernelSHAP provides additive
    feature attributions with strong consistency guarantees.
