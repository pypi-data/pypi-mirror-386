    Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a perturbation‑based approach that explains individual predictions by
    fitting a simple, interpretable surrogate model locally around the prediction
    of interest. By sampling perturbed versions of the input and weighting them by
    their proximity to the original instance, LIME learns per‑feature importance scores
    that approximate the behaviour of the underlying black‑box model in that local region.

        Args:
            model (PreTrainedModel): model to explain

            batch_size (int): batch size for the attribution method
            granularity (Granularity, optional): The level of granularity for the explanation.
                Options are: `ALL_TOKENS`, `TOKEN`, `WORD`, or `SENTENCE`.
                Defaults to Granularity.WORD.
                To obtain it, `from interpreto import Granularity` then `Granularity.WORD`.
            granularity_aggregation_strategy (GranularityAggregationStrategy): how to aggregate token-level attributions into granularity scores.
                Options are: MEAN, MAX, MIN, SUM, and SIGNED_MAX.
                Ignored for `granularity` set to `ALL_TOKENS` or `TOKEN`.
            inference_mode (Callable[[torch.Tensor], torch.Tensor], optional): The mode used for inference.
                It can be either one of LOGITS, SOFTMAX, or LOG_SOFTMAX. Use InferenceModes to choose the appropriate mode.
            n_perturbations (int): the number of perturbations to generate.
            perturb_probability (float): probability of perturbation.
            distance_function (DistancesFromMaskProtocol): distance function used to compute weights of perturbed samples in the linear model training.
            kernel_width (float | Callable | None): kernel width used in the `similarity_kernel`.
                If None, the kernel width is computed using the `default_kernel_width_fn` function.
