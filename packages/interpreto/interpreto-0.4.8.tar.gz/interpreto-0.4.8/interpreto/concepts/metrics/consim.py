    """Code: [:octicons-mark-github-24: `concepts/metrics/consim.py` ](https://github.com/FOR-sight-ai/interpreto/blob/dev/interpreto/concepts/metrics/consim.py)

    ConSim for Concept-based Simulatability. Was introduced by Poché et al. in 2025[^1].

    It evaluates all three components of the concept-based explanation:

    - the concepts space

    - the concepts interpretation

    - the concepts importance

    To evaluate explanations on a given model $f$, ConSim evaluates to which extent explanations
    help a meta-predictor $\\Psi$ to simulate the predictions of the model $f$.

    In our case, the role of the meta-predictor will be played by `user_llm`, and interface calling
    a model either from local, or from a remote API, such as OpenAI or HuggingFace.
    Therefore, most of the code correspond to building the prompts for the LLM.

    There are three steps to ConSim:

    - Step 0:
        Instantiate the ConSim metric
        with the `model_with_split_points` ($f$) and the `user_llm` ($\\Psi$).

    - Step 1:
        Select interesting examples for ConSim with the `select_examples` method.
        Samples are selected to see how well $\\Psi$ can simulate $f$.
        Thus there are samples for every classes and many initial errors from $f$.

    - Step 2:
        Evaluate the ConSim score with the `evaluate` method. It is an accuracy score between $\\Psi$ and $f$ predictions.
        But we selected interesting examples, so it cannot be compared to a natural accuracy on the dataset.
        Therefore, we need to compare it to a baseline ().

    Tip:
        We highly recommend to do the steps 1 and 2 several times with different seeds to get more statistically significant results.
        The initial papers[^1] used five different seeds..
