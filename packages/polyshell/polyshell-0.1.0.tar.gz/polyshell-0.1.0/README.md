_This project was developed as part of ECMWF's Code4Earth initiative by Niall Oswald, Kenneth Martin and Jo Wayne Tan._

---

## Highlights

- ✅ Guarantees encapsulation of the initial polygon.
- 🔥 Rust-powered performance.
- 🧩 A simple Python API to access all reduction methods and modes.
- 🌍 Seamlessly integration with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/).
- 📏 Tunable accuracy and reduction rates.
- 🐍 Python and [PyPy](https://pypy.org/) compatible.

PolyShell is supported by the [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) through
the [Code for Earth programme](https://codeforearth.ecmwf.int/).

---

## Installation

PolyShell is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) for easy installation:

```console
$ pip install polyshell
```

PolyShell can also be built from source using [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/). See the
guide [here](https://ecmwf.github.io/PolyShell/user-guide/installation/).

---

## Example

All of PolyShell's reduction algorithms are accessible through `reduce_polygon`.

```python
from polyshell import reduce_polygon

original = [
    (0.0, 0.0),
    (0.0, 1.0),
    (0.5, 0.5),
    (1.0, 1.0),
    (1.0, 0.0),
    (0.0, 0.0),
]

reduced = reduce_polygon(original, "auto", method="vw")
```

For all the available options, see
the [full list of features](https://ecmwf.github.io/PolyShell/user-guide/features/).
