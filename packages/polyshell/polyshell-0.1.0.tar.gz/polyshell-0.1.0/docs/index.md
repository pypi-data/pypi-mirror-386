## Highlights

- ‚úÖ Guarantees encapsulation of the initial polygon.
- üî• Rust-powered performance.
- üß© A simple Python API to access all reduction methods and modes.
- üåç Seamlessly integration with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/).
- üìè Tunable accuracy and reduction rates.
- üêç Python and [PyPy](https://pypy.org/) compatible.

PolyShell is supported by the [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) through
the [Code for Earth programme](https://codeforearth.ecmwf.int/).

## Installation

PolyShell is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) for easy installation:

<!-- termynal -->

```
$ pip install polyshell
---> 100%
Successfully installed polyshell
```

PolyShell can also be built from source using [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/).
See the guide [here](./user-guide/installation.md#build-from-source).

## Example

All of PolyShell's reduction algorithms are accessible through `reduce_polygon`.

=== "Python 3.10+"

    ```python
    from polyshell import reduce_polygon

    original = [
        (0.0, 0.0),
        (0.0, 1.0),
        (0.5, 0.5),
        (1.0, 1.0),
        (1.0, 0.0),
        (0.0, 0.0),
    ]

    reduced = reduce_polygon(original, "auto", method="vw")
    ```
