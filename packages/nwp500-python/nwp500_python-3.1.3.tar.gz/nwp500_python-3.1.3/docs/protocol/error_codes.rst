Error Severity Levels
---------------------

**Level 1 Errors:**

Level 1 errors allow the water heater to continue operating while displaying the error condition. The front panel flashes red and shows the error icon. Users can:

* Press the OK button to enter error display mode
* View error details in the Error History menu
* Clear the error by resolving the underlying issue

Level 1 errors are automatically cleared once the problem is resolved. The system continues minimal operations to maintain safety and prevent damage.

Viewing Error History
---------------------

The water heater stores the 10 most recent errors, with the most recent displayed at the top. To view error history:

1. Press and hold the Menu button for more than 5 seconds
2. Select "Error History"
3. Use Up/Down buttons to navigate the error list
4. Press OK to view detailed information about a specific error

Each error record includes:

* Error code and sub code
* Date and time of occurrence
* Operating conditions when error occurred

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------

**Temperature Sensor Errors (E407, E480, E481, E910, E912, E914, E920):**

* Verify sensor wiring connections are secure
* Check for damaged or pinched wires
* Use Service Mode to test sensor readings
* Sensors operate within -4°F to 149°F (-20°C to 65°C)
* System can operate with reduced capacity using opposite heating element if one tank sensor fails

**Heating Element Errors (E096, E097, E615):**

* Verify power supply: 208-240V AC, 60Hz, 1 Phase
* Check element resistance with multimeter
* Inspect wiring for loose connections or damage
* Element specifications: 3,755W @ 208V or 5,000W @ 240V
* Verify circuit breaker is 30A rated

**Compressor/Heat Pump Errors (E907, E908, E911, E913, E915, E916, E940):**

* Check compressor power connections
* Verify proper voltage supply
* Listen for unusual compressor sounds
* Check refrigerant pressures (requires certified technician)
* Verify evaporator fan operation
* Check EEV operation and step position
* Ensure adequate airflow through air intake/exhaust (Ø8")

**Communication Errors (E596, E781):**

* Verify WiFi signal strength (check wifiRssi in status)
* For CTA-2045: Check module connection and wiring
* Restart device if communication error persists
* Check front panel settings menu for communication enable/disable

**Water System Errors (E326, E799, E990):**

* E326 (Dry fire): Ensure tank is filled before operation
* E799 (Water leak): Inspect all plumbing connections and tank for leaks
* E990 (Condensate overflow): Clear condensate drain tubing of obstructions

**When to Contact Technical Support:**

Contact technical support at 1-800-519-8794 when:

* Multiple errors occur simultaneously
* Error persists after following diagnostic steps
* Control board or complex components need replacement
* Refrigerant system work is required (certified technician only)
* Safety concerns exist
