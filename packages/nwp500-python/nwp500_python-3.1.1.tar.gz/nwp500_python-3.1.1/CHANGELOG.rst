Changed
-------

Fixed
-----

- **Critical Bug**: Thread-safe reconnection task creation from MQTT callbacks
  
  - Fixed ``RuntimeError: no running event loop`` when connection is interrupted
  - Fixed ``RuntimeWarning: coroutine '_reconnect_with_backoff' was never awaited``
  - Connection interruption callbacks run in separate threads without event loops
  - Implemented ``_start_reconnect_task()`` helper method to properly create reconnection tasks
  - Uses existing ``_schedule_coroutine()`` method for thread-safe task scheduling
  - Prevents crashes during automatic reconnection after connection interruptions
  - Ensures reconnection tasks are properly awaited and executed

- **Critical Bug**: Thread-safe event emission from MQTT callbacks
  
  - Fixed ``RuntimeError: no running event loop in thread 'Dummy-1'``
  - MQTT callbacks run in separate threads created by AWS IoT SDK
  - Implemented ``_schedule_coroutine()`` method for thread-safe scheduling
  - Event loop reference captured during ``connect()`` for cross-thread access
  - Uses ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()`` for safe event emission
  - Prevents crashes when emitting events from MQTT message handlers
  - All event emissions now work correctly from any thread

- **Bug**: Incorrect method parameter passing in temperature control
  
  - Fixed ``set_dhw_temperature_display()`` calling ``set_dhw_temperature()`` with wrong parameters
  - Was passing individual parameters (``device_id``, ``device_type``, ``additional_value``)
  - Now correctly passes ``Device`` object as expected by method signature
  - Simplified implementation to just calculate offset and delegate to base method
  - Updated docstrings to match actual method signatures

- **Enhancement**: Anonymized MAC addresses in documentation
  
  - Replaced all occurrences of real MAC address (``04786332fca0``) with placeholder (``aabbccddeeff``)
  - Updated ``API_CLIENT.rst``, ``MQTT_CLIENT.rst``, ``MQTT_MESSAGES.rst``
  - Updated built HTML documentation files
  - Protects privacy in public documentation

  - Power-off now uses command code ``33554433``
  - Power-on now uses command code ``33554434``
  - DHW mode control now uses command code ``33554437``
  - Discovered through network traffic analysis of official app

- **Critical Bug**: MQTT topic pattern matching with wildcards
  
  - Fixed ``_topic_matches_pattern()`` to correctly handle ``#`` wildcard
  - Topics now match when message arrives on base topic (e.g., ``cmd/52/device/res``)
  - Topics also match subtopics (e.g., ``cmd/52/device/res/extra``)
  - Added length validation to prevent index out of bounds errors
  - Enables callbacks to receive messages correctly

- **Bug**: Missing ``OperationMode.STANDBY`` enum value
  
  - Added ``STANDBY = 0`` to ``OperationMode`` enum
  - Device reports mode 0 when tank is fully charged and no heating is needed
  - Added graceful fallback for unknown enum values
  - Prevents ``ValueError`` when parsing device status

- **Bug**: Insufficient topic subscriptions
  
  - Examples now subscribe to broader topic patterns
  - Subscribe to ``cmd/{device_type}/{device_topic}/#`` to catch all command messages
  - Subscribe to ``evt/{device_type}/{device_topic}/#`` to catch all event messages
  - Ensures all device responses are received

- **Enhancement**: Robust enum conversion with fallbacks
  
  - Added try/except blocks for all enum conversions in ``DeviceStatus.from_dict()``
  - Added try/except blocks for all enum conversions in ``DeviceFeature.from_dict()``
  - Unknown operation modes default to ``STANDBY``
  - Unknown temperature types default to ``FAHRENHEIT``
