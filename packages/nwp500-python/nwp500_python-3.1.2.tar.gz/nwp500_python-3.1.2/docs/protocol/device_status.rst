DHW Operation Setting Modes
----------------------------

The ``dhwOperationSetting`` field is an integer that maps to the following modes. These modes balance energy efficiency and recovery time based on user needs.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 15 15 40

   * - Value
     - Mode
     - Recovery Time
     - Energy Efficiency
     - Description
   * - 1
     - HEAT_PUMP
     - Very Slow
     - High
     - Most energy-efficient mode, using only the heat pump. Recovery time varies with ambient temperature and humidity. Higher ambient temperature and humidity improve efficiency and reduce recovery time.
   * - 2
     - ELECTRIC
     - Fast
     - Very Low
     - Uses only upper and lower electric heaters (not simultaneously). Least energy-efficient with shortest recovery time. Can operate continuously for up to 72 hours before automatically reverting to previous mode.
   * - 3
     - ENERGY_SAVER
     - Fast
     - Very High
     - Default mode. Combines the heat pump and electric heater for balanced efficiency and recovery time. Heat pump is primarily used with electric heater for backup. Applied during initial shipment and factory reset.
   * - 4
     - HIGH_DEMAND
     - Very Fast
     - Low
     - Combines heat pump and electric heater with more frequent use of electric heater for faster recovery. Suitable when higher hot water supply is needed.
   * - 5
     - VACATION
     - None
     - Very High
     - Suspends heating to save energy during absences (0-99 days). Only minimal operations like freeze protection and anti-seize are performed. Heating resumes 9 hours before the vacation period ends.
   * - 6
     - POWER_OFF
     - None
     - None
     - Device is powered off. This value appears in ``dhwOperationSetting`` when the device has been powered off via the power-off command.


Operation Mode Status Values
-----------------------------

The following ``operationMode`` values appear in status messages from the device. These values reflect the device's actual operational state (what it's doing right now):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30 60

   * - Value
     - Mode
     - Notes
   * - 0
     - STANDBY
     - Device is idle, not actively heating. Can occur when device is powered off OR when it's on but not heating. Check ``dhwOperationSetting`` for value 6 (``POWER_OFF``) to distinguish between these states.
   * - 32
     - HEAT_PUMP_MODE
     - Heat pump is actively running to heat water.
   * - 64
     - HYBRID_EFFICIENCY_MODE
     - Device is actively heating in Energy Saver mode (hybrid efficiency).
   * - 96
     - HYBRID_BOOST_MODE
     - Device is actively heating in High Demand mode (hybrid boost).

Understanding operationMode vs dhwOperationSetting
---------------------------------------------------

These two fields serve different purposes and it's critical to understand their relationship:

Field Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**dhwOperationSetting** (DhwOperationSetting enum with command values 1-6)
  The user's **configured mode preference** - what heating mode the device should use when it needs to heat water. This is set via the ``dhw-mode`` command and persists until changed by the user or device.
  
  * Type: ``DhwOperationSetting`` enum
  * Values: 
    
    * 1 = ``HEAT_PUMP`` (Heat Pump Only)
    * 2 = ``ELECTRIC`` (Electric Only)
    * 3 = ``ENERGY_SAVER`` (Hybrid: Efficiency)
    * 4 = ``HIGH_DEMAND`` (Hybrid: Boost)
    * 5 = ``VACATION`` (Vacation mode)
    * 6 = ``POWER_OFF`` (Device is powered off)
  
  * Set by: User via app, CLI, or MQTT command
  * Changes: Only when user explicitly changes the mode or powers device off/on
  * Meaning: "When heating is needed, use this mode" OR "I'm powered off" (if value is 6)
  * Value 6 (``POWER_OFF``) indicates the device was powered off via the power-off command. This is how to distinguish between "powered off" and "on but idle".

**operationMode** (CurrentOperationMode enum with status values 0, 32, 64, 96)
  The device's **current actual operational state** - what the device is doing RIGHT NOW. This reflects real-time operation and changes automatically based on whether the device is idle or actively heating.
  
  * Type: ``CurrentOperationMode`` enum
  * Values:
    
    * 0 = ``STANDBY`` (Idle, not heating)
    * 32 = ``HEAT_PUMP_MODE`` (Heat Pump actively running)
    * 64 = ``HYBRID_EFFICIENCY_MODE`` (Energy Saver actively heating)
    * 96 = ``HYBRID_BOOST_MODE`` (High Demand actively heating)
  
  * Set by: Device automatically based on heating demand
  * Changes: Dynamically as device starts/stops heating
  * Meaning: "This is what I'm doing right now"
  * **Note**: This field shows ``STANDBY`` (0) both when device is powered off AND when it's on but not heating. Check ``dhwOperationSetting`` to determine if device is actually powered off (value 6).

Key Relationship
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The relationship between these fields can be summarized as:

* ``dhwOperationSetting`` = "What mode to use when heating"
* ``operationMode`` = "Am I heating right now, and if so, how?"

A device can be **idle** (``operationMode = STANDBY``) while still being **configured** for a specific heating mode (``dhwOperationSetting = ENERGY_SAVER``). When the tank temperature drops and heating begins, ``operationMode`` will change to reflect active heating (e.g., ``HYBRID_EFFICIENCY_MODE``), but ``dhwOperationSetting`` remains unchanged.

Real-World Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Example 1: Energy Saver Mode, Tank is Hot**
  ::

    dhwOperationSetting = 3 (ENERGY_SAVER)    # Configured mode
    operationMode = 0 (STANDBY)                # Currently idle
    dhwChargePer = 100                         # Tank is fully charged
    
  *Interpretation:* Device is configured for Energy Saver mode, but water is already at temperature so no heating is occurring.

**Example 2: Energy Saver Mode, Actively Heating**
  ::

    dhwOperationSetting = 3 (ENERGY_SAVER)           # Configured mode
    operationMode = 64 (HYBRID_EFFICIENCY_MODE)      # Actively heating
    operationBusy = true                             # Heating in progress
    dhwChargePer = 75                                # Tank at 75%
    
  *Interpretation:* Device is using Energy Saver mode to heat the tank, currently at 75% charge.

**Example 3: High Demand Mode, Heat Pump Running**
  ::

    dhwOperationSetting = 4 (HIGH_DEMAND)      # Configured mode
    operationMode = 32 (HEAT_PUMP_MODE)        # Heat pump active
    compUse = true                             # Compressor running
    
  *Interpretation:* Device is configured for High Demand but is currently running just the heat pump component (hybrid heating will engage electric elements as needed).

**Example 4: Device Powered Off**

    dhwOperationSetting = 6 (POWER_OFF)        # Device powered off
    operationMode = 0 (STANDBY)                # Currently idle
    operationBusy = false                      # No heating
    
  *Interpretation:* Device was powered off using the power-off command. Although ``operationMode`` shows ``STANDBY`` (same as an idle device), the ``dhwOperationSetting`` value of 6 indicates it's actually powered off, not just idle.

Displaying Status in a User Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For user-facing applications, follow these guidelines:

**Primary Mode Display**
  Use ``dhwOperationSetting`` to show the user's configured mode preference. This is what users expect to see as "the current mode" because it represents their selection.
  
  **Important**: Check for value 6 (``POWER_OFF``) first to show "Off" or "Powered Off" status.

  Example display::

    Mode: Energy Saver      [when dhwOperationSetting = 1-5]
    Mode: Off               [when dhwOperationSetting = 6]

**Status Indicator**
  Use ``operationMode`` to show real-time operational status:

  * ``STANDBY`` (0): Show "Idle" or "Standby" indicator (but check ``dhwOperationSetting`` for power-off state)
  * ``HEAT_PUMP_MODE`` (32): Show "Heating (Heat Pump)" or heating indicator
  * ``HYBRID_EFFICIENCY_MODE`` (64): Show "Heating (Energy Saver)" or heating indicator
  * ``HYBRID_BOOST_MODE`` (96): Show "Heating (High Demand)" or heating indicator

**Combined Display Examples**
  ::

    # Device on and idle
    Mode: Energy Saver
    Status: Idle ○
    Tank: 100%
    
    # Device on and heating
    Mode: Energy Saver
    Status: Heating ●
    Tank: 75%
    
    # Device powered off
    Mode: Off
    Status: Powered Off
    Tank: 100%

**Code Example**
  .. code-block:: python

    from nwp500.models import DeviceStatus, DhwOperationSetting, CurrentOperationMode

    def format_mode_display(status: DeviceStatus) -> dict:
        """Format mode and status for UI display."""
        
        # Check if device is powered off first
        if status.dhwOperationSetting == DhwOperationSetting.POWER_OFF:
            return {
                'configured_mode': 'Off',
                'operational_state': 'Powered Off',
                'is_heating': False,
                'is_powered_on': False,
                'tank_charge': status.dhwChargePer,
            }
        
        # User's configured mode (what they selected)
        configured_mode = status.dhwOperationSetting.name.replace('_', ' ').title()
        
        # Current operational state
        if status.operationMode == CurrentOperationMode.STANDBY:
            operational_state = "Idle"
            is_heating = False
        elif status.operationMode == CurrentOperationMode.HEAT_PUMP_MODE:
            operational_state = "Heating (Heat Pump)"
            is_heating = True
        elif status.operationMode == CurrentOperationMode.HYBRID_EFFICIENCY_MODE:
            operational_state = "Heating (Energy Saver)"
            is_heating = True
        elif status.operationMode == CurrentOperationMode.HYBRID_BOOST_MODE:
            operational_state = "Heating (High Demand)"
            is_heating = True
        else:
            operational_state = "Unknown"
            is_heating = False
        
        return {
            'configured_mode': configured_mode,       # "Energy Saver"
            'operational_state': operational_state,   # "Idle" or "Heating..."
            'is_heating': is_heating,                 # True/False
            'is_powered_on': True,                    # Device is on
            'tank_charge': status.dhwChargePer,       # 0-100
        }

**Display Notes**

1. **Never display operationMode as "the mode"** - users don't care that the device is in "HYBRID_EFFICIENCY_MODE", they want to know it's set to "Energy Saver"

2. **Do use operationMode for heating indicators** - it tells you whether the device is actively heating right now

3. **Mode changes affect dhwOperationSetting** - when a user changes the mode, you're setting ``dhwOperationSetting``

4. **operationMode changes automatically** - you cannot directly set this; it changes based on device operation

5. **Separate enum types provide clarity** - ``DhwOperationSetting`` (values 1-6) for user preferences, ``CurrentOperationMode`` (values 0/32/64/96) for real-time states

6. **Power off detection** - Check if ``dhwOperationSetting == DhwOperationSetting.POWER_OFF`` to determine if device is powered off vs just idle
