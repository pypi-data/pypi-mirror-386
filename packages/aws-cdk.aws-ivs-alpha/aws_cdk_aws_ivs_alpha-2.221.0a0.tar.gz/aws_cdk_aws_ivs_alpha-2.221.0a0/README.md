Amazon Interactive Video Service (Amazon IVS) is a managed live streaming
solution that is quick and easy to set up, and ideal for creating interactive
video experiences. Send your live streams to Amazon IVS using streaming software
and the service does everything you need to make low-latency live video
available to any viewer around the world, letting you focus on building
interactive experiences alongside the live video. You can easily customize and
enhance the audience experience through the Amazon IVS player SDK and timed
metadata APIs, allowing you to build a more valuable relationship with your
viewers on your own websites and applications.

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

## Channels

An Amazon IVS channel stores configuration information related to your live
stream. You first create a channel and then contribute video to it using the
channel’s stream key to start your live stream.

You can create a channel

```python
my_channel = ivs.Channel(self, "Channel")
```

You can use Advanced Channel type by setting the `type` property to
`ivs.ChannelType.ADVANCED_HD` or `ivs.ChannelType.ADVANCED_SD`.

Additionally, when using the Advanced Channel type, you can set
the `preset` property to `ivs.Preset.CONSTRAINED_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY`
or `ivs.Preset.HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY`.

For more information, see [Amazon IVS Streaming Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/streaming-config.html).

```python
my_channel = ivs.Channel(self, "myChannel",
    type=ivs.ChannelType.ADVANCED_HD,
    preset=ivs.Preset.CONSTRAINED_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY
)
```

If you want to use RTMP ingest, set `insecureIngest` property to `true`.
By default, `insecureIngest` is `false` which means using RTMPS ingest.

**⚠ Note:** RTMP ingest might result in reduced security for your streams. AWS recommends that you use RTMPS for ingest, unless you have specific and verified use cases. For more information, see [Encoder Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/streaming-config.html#streaming-config-settings).

```python
my_rtmp_channel = ivs.Channel(self, "myRtmpChannel",
    type=ivs.ChannelType.STANDARD,
    insecure_ingest=True
)
```

### Multitrack Video

Multitrack video is a new, low-latency streaming paradigm supported by Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS) and services that use Amazon IVS.

You can use Multitrack Video by setting the `multitrackInputConfiguration` property.
Multitrack Video requires both a STANDARD Channel and Fragmented Mp4.

For more information, see [Amazon IVS Multitrack Video](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/multitrack-video.html).

```python
ivs.Channel(self, "ChannelWithMultitrackVideo",
    type=ivs.ChannelType.STANDARD,
    container_format=ivs.ContainerFormat.FRAGMENTED_MP4,
    multitrack_input_configuration=ivs.MultitrackInputConfiguration(
        maximum_resolution=ivs.MaximumResolution.HD,
        policy=ivs.Policy.ALLOW
    )
)
```

### Importing an existing channel

You can reference an existing channel, for example, if you need to create a
stream key for an existing channel

```python
my_channel = ivs.Channel.from_channel_arn(self, "Channel", my_channel_arn)
```

## Stream Keys

A Stream Key is used by a broadcast encoder to initiate a stream and identify
to Amazon IVS which customer and channel the stream is for. If you are
storing this value, it should be treated as if it were a password.

You can create a stream key for a given channel

```python
my_stream_key = my_channel.add_stream_key("StreamKey")
```

## Private Channels

Amazon IVS offers the ability to create private channels, allowing
you to restrict your streams by channel or viewer. You control access
to video playback by enabling playback authorization on channels and
generating signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authorized playback requests.

A playback token is a JWT that you sign (with a playback authorization key)
and include with every playback request for a channel that has playback
authorization enabled.

In order for Amazon IVS to validate the token, you need to upload
the public key that corresponds to the private key you use to sign the token.

```python
key_pair = ivs.PlaybackKeyPair(self, "PlaybackKeyPair",
    public_key_material=my_public_key_pem_string
)
```

Then, when creating a channel, specify the authorized property

```python
my_channel = ivs.Channel(self, "Channel",
    authorized=True
)
```

## Recording Configurations

An Amazon IVS Recording Configuration stores settings that specify how a channel's live streams should be recorded.
You can configure video quality, thumbnail generation, and where recordings are stored in Amazon S3.

For more information about IVS recording, see [IVS Auto-Record to Amazon S3 | Low-Latency Streaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/record-to-s3.html).

You can create a recording configuration:

```python
# create an S3 bucket for storing recordings
recording_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "RecordingBucket")

# create a basic recording configuration
recording_configuration = ivs.RecordingConfiguration(self, "RecordingConfiguration",
    bucket=recording_bucket
)
```

### Renditions of a Recording

When you stream content to an Amazon IVS channel, auto-record-to-s3 uses the source video to generate multiple renditions.

For more information, see [Discovering the Renditions of a Recording](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/record-to-s3.html#r2s3-recording-renditions).

```python
# recording_bucket: s3.Bucket


recording_configuration = ivs.RecordingConfiguration(self, "RecordingConfiguration",
    bucket=recording_bucket,

    # set rendition configuration
    rendition_configuration=ivs.RenditionConfiguration.custom([ivs.Resolution.HD, ivs.Resolution.SD])
)
```

### Thumbnail Generation

You can enable or disable the recording of thumbnails for a live session and modify the interval at which thumbnails are generated for the live session.

Thumbnail intervals may range from 1 second to 60 seconds; by default, thumbnail recording is enabled, at an interval of 60 seconds.

For more information, see [Thumbnails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/record-to-s3.html#r2s3-thumbnails).

```python
# recording_bucket: s3.Bucket


recording_configuration = ivs.RecordingConfiguration(self, "RecordingConfiguration",
    bucket=recording_bucket,

    # set thumbnail settings
    thumbnail_configuration=ivs.ThumbnailConfiguration.interval(ivs.Resolution.HD, [ivs.Storage.LATEST, ivs.Storage.SEQUENTIAL], Duration.seconds(30))
)
```

### Merge Fragmented Streams

The `recordingReconnectWindow` property allows you to specify a window of time (in seconds) during which, if your stream is interrupted and a new stream is started, Amazon IVS tries to record to the same S3 prefix as the previous stream.

In other words, if a broadcast disconnects and then reconnects within the specified interval, the multiple streams are considered a single broadcast and merged together.

For more information, see [Merge Fragmented Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/record-to-s3.html#r2s3-merge-fragmented-streams).

```python
# recording_bucket: s3.Bucket


recording_configuration = ivs.RecordingConfiguration(self, "RecordingConfiguration",
    bucket=recording_bucket,

    # set recording reconnect window
    recording_reconnect_window=Duration.seconds(60)
)
```

### Attaching Recording Configuration to a Channel

To enable recording for a channel, specify the recording configuration when creating the channel:

```python
# recording_configuration: ivs.RecordingConfiguration


channel = ivs.Channel(self, "Channel",
    # set recording configuration
    recording_configuration=recording_configuration
)
```
