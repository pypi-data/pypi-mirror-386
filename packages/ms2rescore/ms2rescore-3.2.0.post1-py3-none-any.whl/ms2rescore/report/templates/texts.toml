[charts.score_comparison]
title = "Score comparison"
description = """
This scatter plot shows the score for both target (blue) and decoy
(red) PSMs before rescoring (x-axis) and after rescoring (y-axis). Dashed
lines indicate the 1% FDR threshold for scores before and after rescoring.
PSMs in the upper-left quadrant are only identified after rescoring.
"""

[charts.fdr_comparison]
title = "False discovery rate comparison"
description = """
This plot shows the number of identified target PSMs
in function of the FDR threshold. The plot starts at the top-right corner
with the total number of PSMs in the dataset (no FDR filtering). As the
FDR threshold becomes more stringent (towards the left of the x-axis),
the number of identified target PSMs goes down. The dashed line
indicates the 1% FDR threshold.
"""

[charts.identification_overlap]
title = "Identification overlap"
description = """
This plot shows the unique identified PSMs, peptides, and (optionally)
protein groups that were removed, retained, and gained by rescoring.
"""

[charts.score_histogram]
title = "Score histogram"
description = """
The score histogram shows the score distribution for both target PSMs (blue)
and decoy PSMs (red). The target score distribution is exected to show
two modes, corresponding to high-scoring (presumably correct) PSMs
and low-scoring (presumably incorrect) PSMs. The decoy score
distribution is expected to show a single mode, which should
approximate the low-scoring part of the target score distribution
as closely as possible. This approximation can be more easily assessed
in the percentile-percentile plot (see below). The dashed line indicates
the 1% FDR threshold.
"""

[charts.pp_plot]
title = "Percentile-percentile plot"
description = """
The percentile-percentile (PP) plot shows the empirical cumulative
distribution function (ECDF) of the target distribution in function of
the ECDF of the decoy distribution. In the context of peptide
identification, it can be used to assess the quality of decoy PSMs and
their capacity to help in correctly estimating the false discovery rate.

Ideally, the PP-plot should follow a straight diagonal line up until the
end of the decoy distribution (right-hand side of the plot), where the
line turns vertically upwards. This means that the decoy distribution
perfectly aligns with the first part of the target distribution (the
low-scoring and presumably bad target PSMs) and therefore correctly
models the bad target PSMs. This diagonal line matches the ratio of
the number of decoy to the number of target PSMs.

[charts.feature_usage]
title = "Feature usage in rescoring model"
description = """
This plot shows the usage of each features in the
rescoring model. The higher the usage, the more the feature contributes to separating target and
decoy PSMs. Note that the usage is not necessarily correlated with the individual
performance of the feature, as some features may be redundant with others.
"""

[charts.feature_performance]
title = "Individual feature performance"
description = """
The following plot shows the performance of individual features. For each
feature, q-values are calculated as if that feature was individually used for scoring PSMs without
any other information. Then, the area under curve (AUC) is calculated for the empirical cumulative
distribution function (ECDF) of the q-values. The higher the AUC, the better the feature is at
discriminating between target and decoy PSMs without any other information.
"""

[charts.ms2pip_pearson]
title = "MS²PIP model performance"
description = """
MS²PIP model performance can be estimated by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient
between the predicted and observed fragment ion intensities. Fragment intensities are first
normalized to the total ion current and then log2-transformed. The following histogram shows the
distribution of Pearson correlation coefficients for all target PSMs that passed the 1% FDR
threshold. The red dashed line indicates the median correlation.
"""

[charts.deeplc_performance]
title = "DeepLC model performance"
description = """
DeepLC model performance can be visualized by plotting the predicted retention times against the
observed retention times (top chart), or by calculating the relative mean absolute error (RMAE). The
bottom chart shows the distribution of RMAE values of DeepLC predictions on 460 different benchmark
datasets. The red line indicates the RMAE value for all target PSMs that passed the 1% FDR threshold
of the current dataset. A lower RMAE value indicates better performance.
