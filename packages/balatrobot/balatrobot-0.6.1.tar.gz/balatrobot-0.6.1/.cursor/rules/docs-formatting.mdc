# Documentation Formatting Guidelines

When writing documentation files in the docs directory:

## Header Structure

- Use minimal header nesting - prefer level 1 (`#`) and level 2 (`##`) headers
- Level 3 headers (`###`) are allowed when they significantly improve readability and document structure
- **Method names, function signatures, and similar structured content** should use level 3 headers (`###`) for better navigation and clarity
- For other sub-sections that would normally be level 3 or deeper, consider using **bold text** or other formatting instead
- Preserve logical hierarchy and importance in your header structure

## Spacing Requirements

- Always leave a blank line after any title/header
- Always leave a blank line before any list (bulleted or numbered)
- This ensures proper visual separation and readability

## Examples

Good formatting:
```markdown
# Main Title

Content here...

## Section Title

More content...

### Method Name or Structured Content

Detailed information...

- List item 1
- List item 2
```

Avoid:
```markdown
# Main Title
Content immediately after title...
#### Excessive nesting
- List without spacing above
```
