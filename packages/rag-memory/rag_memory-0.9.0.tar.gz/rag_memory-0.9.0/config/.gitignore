# Local configuration files with credentials
# These are too sensitive to commit, but the .example.yaml and config.test.yaml
# show the structure and are safe to version control

# Ignore local dev config (has credentials)
config.dev.yaml

# Keep these safe files in version control:
# - config.example.yaml (template)
# - config.test.yaml (test config, no real secrets)
