# RAG Memory - Secrets Configuration
# ================================================================================
# This file stores ONLY secrets that should never be committed to git.
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Add your OPENAI_API_KEY (get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
# 3. For development: .env is loaded by conftest.py and local dev scripts
# 4. For system install: setup.py will prompt for this value interactively
#
# NEVER commit .env to git - it's already in .gitignore
# ================================================================================

# OpenAI API Key (required for all operations)
# Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
