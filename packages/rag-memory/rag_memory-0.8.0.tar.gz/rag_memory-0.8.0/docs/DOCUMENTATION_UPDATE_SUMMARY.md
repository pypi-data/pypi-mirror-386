## Key Topics Now Fully Documented

### 1. Vector Normalization (Critical Success Factor)
- What it is: Converting embeddings to unit length
- Why it matters: 0.3 → 0.73 similarity improvement
- Implementation: Shown in code
- Impact: Highlighted as non-negotiable
- Location: OVERVIEW.md "Vector Normalization" section

### 2. Document Chunking
- Default strategy: 1000 chars, 200 overlap
- Hierarchical splitting: Headers → paragraphs → sentences → words
- Web pages: Larger chunks (2500), more overlap (300)
- Why it matters: Improves search accuracy
- Example: Shows how chunks relate to original
- Location: OVERVIEW.md "Document Chunking" section

### 3. Web Crawling & Re-Crawl
- Single page ingestion
- Multi-page link following (BFS, configurable depth)
- Metadata tracking (crawl_root_url, session_id, depth, parent_url)
- Re-crawl strategy: "Nuclear option" for updates
- Safety: Only deletes pages from specific root, safe for mixed collections
- Location: OVERVIEW.md sections + CLAUDE.md CLI reference

### 4. Search Optimization
- Baseline vector-only: OPTIMAL (81% recall@5)
- Hybrid search: Worse performance, not recommended
- Multi-query: Worse performance, higher cost, not recommended
- Re-ranking: Not needed (MRR already high)
- Threshold tuning: Guide with examples (0.7, 0.5, 0.3)
- Location: SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION.md (entire doc)

### 5. Knowledge Graph (Graphiti + Neo4j)
- What it adds: Entity extraction, relationships, temporal tracking
- Status: Phase 3 complete, Phase 4 in progress
- Production ready: NO (cleanup not implemented)
- Use cases: Research, relationship discovery, temporal reasoning
- Warnings: Update/delete/recrawl don't clean graph yet
- Location: KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md (entire doc)

### 6. 16 MCP Tools

- Category organization (7 categories)
- Location: MCP_QUICK_START.md "Available Tools" section

### 7. Collections & Organization
- Many-to-many: Documents can belong to multiple collections
- Use cases: Topic-based, source-based, temporal, access-based
- Flexibility: No duplication needed
- Examples: How to organize knowledge
- Location: OVERVIEW.md "Collections (Organization Layer)" section

### 8. Similarity Scores & Thresholds
- Score range: 0.0-1.0
- Interpretation: 0.7+ = high, 0.5-0.7 = related, 0.3-0.5 = marginal
- Default behavior: Return top N without threshold
- Threshold tuning: 0.7 (strict), 0.5 (balanced), 0.3 (broad)
- Distribution: Typical results shown with examples
- Location: OVERVIEW.md "Performance & Similarity Scores" section

### 9. Deployment Options
- Local: Free, self-hosted
- Fly.io: $3-5/month (auto-scale), $40+/month (always-on)
- Hybrid: Local CLI + cloud MCP server
- Cost breakdown: OpenAI + database + deployment
- Location: OVERVIEW.md "Deployment Options" section

### 10. Cost Analysis
- One-time embedding: $0.02 per million tokens
- Searches: Free (local pgvector)
- Estimates: 1K docs = $0.02, 10K = $0.15, 100K = $1.50
- Per document: ~$0.0000067
