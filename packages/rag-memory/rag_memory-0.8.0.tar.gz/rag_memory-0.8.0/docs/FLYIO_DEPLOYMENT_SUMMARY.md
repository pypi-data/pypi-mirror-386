## Technical Highlights

### Docker Strategy
- **Base Image:** `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.44.0-jammy`
  - Includes Chromium for Crawl4AI
  - Pre-configured with Playwright dependencies
  - Avoids browser download in container

- **Multi-Stage Build:**
  - Stage 1: Build dependencies (uv sync)
  - Stage 2: Runtime (copy venv + app code)
  - Result: Faster builds, smaller image

### Fly.io Configuration
- **Region:** `iad` (Ashburn, VA)
  - Closest to Supabase us-east-1
  - Minimizes database latency

- **Auto-Scaling:**
  - Min machines: 0 (scale to zero)
  - Auto-stop: 5 minutes idle
  - Auto-start: on incoming request
  - Cost savings: ~85% vs always-on

- **Networking:**
  - Internal port: 8000
  - External ports: 80 (HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS redirect), 443 (HTTPS)
  - SSL certificates: automatic via Fly.io

### Production Features
- **Health Checks:**
  - Endpoint: `/health`
  - Checks database connectivity
  - Returns status, version, timestamp

- **Logging:**
  - Structured logs to stdout
  - Captured by Fly.io
  - Accessible via `flyctl logs`

- **Error Handling:**
  - Graceful database connection recovery
  - Proper HTTP status codes
  - Detailed error messages for debugging

## Cost Analysis

### Monthly Costs (Estimated)

**Fly.io:**
- Minimal usage (2 hours/day): **$3-5/month**
- Heavy usage (24/7): **$40/month**
- With scale-to-zero: **~$5/month** (typical)

**Supabase:**
- Free tier (500MB): **$0/month**
- Pro tier (8GB, backups): **$25/month**

**OpenAI:**
- Embeddings: **~$5/month** (typical usage)

**Total:**
- Free tier: **$8-10/month** (Fly.io + OpenAI)
- Pro tier: **$30-35/month** (Fly.io + Supabase Pro + OpenAI)

**Cost Optimization:**
- Scale-to-zero reduces Fly.io costs by ~85%
- Supabase Session Pooler maximizes connection efficiency
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small is cost-effective

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks (Mitigated)
1. **Playwright/Chromium compatibility**
   - **Mitigation:** Using official Playwright Docker image
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ Known to work with Crawl4AI

2. **Supabase connection limits**
   - **Mitigation:** Using Session Pooler (already configured)
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ Handles 60-500 concurrent connections

### Medium Risks (Monitored)
3. **Cold start latency**
   - **Target:** <5 seconds
   - **Mitigation:** Documented as expected behavior
   - **Contingency:** Keep machine warm if needed

4. **Docker build time**
   - **Target:** <10 minutes
   - **Mitigation:** Multi-stage build with caching
   - **Status:** Expected to meet target

### Low Risks (Acceptable)
5. **Fly.io costs higher than expected**
   - **Mitigation:** Scale-to-zero enabled by default
   - **Monitoring:** Fly.io dashboard + alerts

## Questions for Stakeholder Review

Before starting implementation, please confirm:

1. **Budget Approval:**
   - Is $30-50/month budget approved for Fly.io + Supabase Pro? ‚úÖ (Assumed yes)

2. **Timeline Approval:**
   - Is 2-week timeline acceptable? ‚úÖ (Reasonable estimate)

3. **Deployment URL:**
   - Is `rag-memory-mcp.fly.dev` acceptable, or do you need custom domain? ‚ö†Ô∏è

4. **Authentication:**
   - Do we need to add authentication for remote access, or is open API okay initially? ‚ö†Ô∏è

5. **Monitoring:**
   - Are Fly.io built-in metrics sufficient, or do we need additional monitoring (e.g., DataDog)? ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Note:** Items marked ‚ö†Ô∏è have defaults assumed in planning but should be confirmed.

## Conclusion

**Planning is complete and comprehensive.** All technical decisions have been made, risks have been assessed, and implementation steps are clearly defined.

**The deployment is low-risk** because:
- We're using proven technologies (Playwright, Fly.io, Supabase)
- The MCP server already works locally (no major code changes)
- We have a clear rollback plan
- Local development remains unchanged

**Implementation can begin immediately** with Phase 1 (Docker setup). Each phase has clear acceptance criteria and can be validated independently.

**Estimated time to production:** 10 working days (2 weeks)
