### Optimizing Search
1. Read: [SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION.md](SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION.md) - "Baseline Search (RECOMMENDED)"
2. Read: [SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION.md](SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION.md) - "Threshold Tuning Guide"
3. Use: `rag search "query" --threshold 0.7` (or 0.5, 0.3)

### Exploring Knowledge Graphs
1. Read: [KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md](KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md) - "Overview"
2. Read: [KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md](KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md) - "Setup & Prerequisites"

## 🔧 Reference Tables

### Similarity Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Meaning | Use Case |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| 0.90-1.00 | Near-identical | Exact match or close rephrasing |
| 0.70-0.89 | Highly relevant | What you're looking for |
| 0.50-0.69 | Related | Relevant but less direct |
| 0.30-0.49 | Somewhat related | Might be useful, requires review |
| 0.00-0.29 | Loosely related | Noise, usually ignore |

### Recommended Thresholds

| Threshold | Use Case | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| 0.70 | Strict/Production | Customer support Q&A - only high confidence |
| 0.50 | Balanced/Default | General search - good mix of precision+recall |
| 0.30 | Exploratory/Research | Discovery mode - cast wide net |
| None | Top-N Results | Return top 10 regardless of score |

### What's Included vs Not

**✅ Production Ready:**
- PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Vector normalization
- Document chunking
- Collections
- Web crawling & re-crawl
- 16 MCP tools
- 25+ CLI commands

**⚠️ Experimental (Phase 3 complete, Phase 4 pending):**
- Knowledge graph (entity extraction, relationships, temporal)

**❌ Analyzed but Not Recommended:**
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- Multi-query retrieval
- Re-ranking with cross-encoders

## 📊 Feature Status

### By Category

**Vector Search (RAG) - PRODUCTION READY ✅**
- Baseline vector-only: Optimal performance (81% recall@5)
- Chunking: 1000 chars, 200 overlap
- Similarity: 0.7-0.95 for good matches
- Speed: 413ms average latency

**Web Crawling - PRODUCTION READY ✅**
- Single page ingestion
- Multi-page link following (BFS)
- Metadata tracking (crawl_root_url, session_id, depth)
- Re-crawl for updates (safe, targeted)

**Collections - PRODUCTION READY ✅**
- Many-to-many relationships
- Flexible organization
- No duplication needed

**MCP Server - PRODUCTION READY ✅**
- 16 tools available
- Multiple transports (stdio, SSE, HTTP)
- Graceful degradation if graph unavailable

**Knowledge Graph - EXPERIMENTAL ⚠️**
- Phase 3 complete: Ingestion works
- Phase 4 pending: Cleanup not implemented
- Issue: Graph not updated on document edit/delete
- Issue: Graph orphans accumulate on recrawl
- Recommendation: Use for research only, not production
