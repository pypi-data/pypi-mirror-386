# Search Optimization Results & Recommendations

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line:** Use baseline vector-only search. It's optimal for documentation datasets.

**Tested Date:** 2025-10-11
**Dataset:** 391 documents, 2,093 chunks (claude-agent-sdk)
**Conclusion:** Baseline vector-only search outperforms all attempted optimizations

---

## Baseline Search (RECOMMENDED)

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **Recall@5 (any relevant)** | 81.0% | 4 out of 5 relevant docs found in top 5 |
| **Recall@5 (highly relevant)** | 78.6% | 3.9 out of 5 perfect matches found in top 5 |
| **Precision@5** | 57.1% | 3 out of 5 results shown are relevant |
| **Mean Reciprocal Rank** | 0.679 | First relevant result at position ~1.5 |
| **nDCG@10** | 1.471 | Quality ranking of top 10 is excellent |
| **Avg Query Time** | 413.6ms | Fast enough for real-time interaction |

### Why It Works So Well

1. **Quality Dataset** - Well-structured documentation
2. **Strong Embeddings** - text-embedding-3-small captures semantics effectively
3. **Vector Normalization** - Accurate 0.7-0.95 similarity range
4. **HNSW Indexing** - Fast, accurate retrieval
5. **Simple > Complex** - No noise from keyword matching

### Implementation

**CLI:**
```bash
uv run rag search "PostgreSQL performance" --collection my-docs
```

**MCP Tool:**
```python
search_documents(
    query="PostgreSQL performance",
    collection_name="my-docs",
    limit=10  # Top 10 results
)
```

**What Happens:**
1. Query converted to embedding (text-embedding-3-small)
2. Embedding normalized to unit length
3. pgvector searches using HNSW index
4. Returns top 10 results ranked by similarity
5. Optional: Include full source document content

### Similarity Score Distribution

**Typical Results for Documentation Search:**

```
Query: "How to optimize database queries"

Result #1: 0.89 - Article on Query Optimization (EXACT MATCH)
Result #2: 0.84 - PostgreSQL Performance Tips (HIGHLY RELEVANT)
Result #3: 0.78 - Database Indexing Guide (RELEVANT)
Result #4: 0.72 - SQL Best Practices (RELEVANT)
Result #5: 0.68 - Connection Pool Configuration (SOMEWHAT RELATED)
Result #6: 0.61 - Debugging Tools (LOOSELY RELATED)
Result #7: 0.54 - Logging Configuration (TANGENTIAL)
Result #8: 0.48 - Security Guide (MARGINAL)
Result #9: 0.41 - Backup Procedures (WEAK)
Result #10: 0.38 - Installation Guide (WEAK)
```

**Good Threshold:** 0.7 gives high precision (87% relevant)

## Phase 1: Hybrid Search (NOT RECOMMENDED)

### What It Is

Combines vector search with PostgreSQL full-text search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

**Components:**
- Vector similarity search (original RAG)
- PostgreSQL `plainto_tsquery` for keywords
- RRF with k=60 to merge results

### Performance Results

**Comparison to Baseline:**

| Metric | Baseline | Hybrid | Change |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Recall@5 (any) | 81.0% | 76.2% | ↓ 4.8% |
| Recall@5 (high) | 78.6% | 78.6% | = |
| Precision@5 | 57.1% | 45.7% | ↓ 11.4% |
| MRR | 0.679 | 0.583 | ↓ 14.1% |
| nDCG@10 | 1.471 | 1.159 | ↓ 21.2% |
| Latency | 413.6ms | 684.3ms | ↑ 65% |

### Why It Failed

1. **Keyword Noise** - "optimization" matches pages about "optimize configuration"
2. **False Positives** - Acronyms and technical terms create spurious matches
3. **Ranking Conflict** - RRF merges two different ranking paradigms poorly
4. **Latency Hit** - Added complexity without quality improvement
5. **Dataset Dependency** - Documentation is already well-structured

### Technical Details

**Migration (if enabled):**
```
File: migrations/archive/001_add_fulltext_search.sql
Status: Created but archived (not recommended)
```

**Hybrid Search Query (Pseudo-SQL):**
```sql
-- Vector search (9 results)
SELECT chunk_id, content, embedding <=> query_vector AS distance
FROM document_chunks
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 9

-- Keyword search (9 results)
SELECT chunk_id, content, rank()
FROM document_chunks
WHERE content_tsv @@ plainto_tsquery(query_text)
ORDER BY rank
LIMIT 9

-- RRF merge (k=60)
-- Reciprocal Rank Fusion formula: 1 / (k + rank)
SELECT *
FROM (
  -- Vector results get ranks 1-9
  -- Keyword results get ranks 1-9
  -- RRF merges by: sum(1/(60+rank))
) ranked_results
ORDER BY rrf_score DESC
```

**Storage Impact:**
- Added `content_tsv tsvector` column
- Created GIN index (664 KB for 391 chunks)
- ~1.7% storage overhead

### When Hybrid MIGHT Work

- Large, unstructured text corpora
- Many acronyms and abbreviations
- Highly technical terminology
- Queries with exact phrase matching needs

**For RAG Memory's use case:** Not applicable

### Code Location

- Implementation: `/src/retrieval/hybrid_search.py`
- Status: Preserved for reference, not recommended

---

## Phase 2: Multi-Query Retrieval (NOT RECOMMENDED)

### What It Is

Expands each query into multiple variations, then merges results via RRF.

**Process:**
1. Original query: "How to optimize PostgreSQL?"
2. Generate variations:
   - "PostgreSQL optimization documentation guide"
   - "How can I improve PostgreSQL database performance?"
   - "PostgreSQL setup and optimization configuration"
3. Search for each (3 API calls to OpenAI)
4. Merge results with RRF

### Performance Results

**Comparison to Baseline:**

| Metric | Baseline | Multi-Query | Change |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Recall@5 (any) | 81.0% | 76.2% | ↓ 4.8% |
| Recall@5 (high) | 78.6% | 71.4% | ↓ 7.2% |
| Precision@5 | 57.1% | 51.4% | ↓ 5.7% |
| MRR | 0.679 | 0.560 | ↓ 17.5% |
| nDCG@10 | 1.471 | 1.315 | ↓ 10.6% |
| Latency | 413.6ms | 982.5ms | ↑ 138% |
| API Calls | 1 | 3 | 3x cost |

### Why It Failed

1. **Rule-Based Expansion is Naive** - Can't capture semantic variations
2. **Worse Results** - 17.5% MRR drop is significant
3. **3x Cost** - 3 embedding API calls instead of 1
4. **3x Latency** - 982ms vs 413ms query time
5. **Original Queries Good Enough** - Well-formed queries don't need expansion

### Example: Why It Fails

**Original Query:** "Python decorators"

**Naive Expansions:**
1. "Python decorators documentation guide"
2. "How do I use Python decorators?"
3. "Python decorators setup configuration"

**Problem:** Expansion #2 is actually worse than original!
- Adds noise ("setup configuration" for decorators?)
- Dilutes semantic signal
- Results don't merge well

**What WOULD Help:**
- LLM-based query expansion (too expensive)
- Semantic clustering of variations
- Learning from click data

### Cost Impact

**3x embedding API calls:**
- 1,000 queries/month × 3 variations × $0.0002/query = $0.60/month
- Small in absolute terms, but for 17.5% worse results
- Net: Wasting money for degraded quality

### Code Location

- Implementation: `/src/retrieval/multi_query.py`
- Status: Preserved for reference, not recommended

---

## Phase 3: Re-Ranking (NOT IMPLEMENTED - ANALYZED)

### Why We Didn't Bother

**Analysis showed it wouldn't help:**

1. **MRR Already High (0.679)**
   - First relevant result appears at position ~1.5
   - Re-ranking can improve positions 3-10, but first match already found

2. **Top-5 Recall is 81%**
   - Most queries already have relevant docs in top 5
   - Re-ranking can't help if relevant doc isn't in top 20

3. **Retrieval Failure Queries**
   - Queries with 0% recall don't have relevant docs in top 20
   - Re-ranking can't create information it doesn't have

4. **Cost/Benefit Analysis:**
   - Re-ranking latency: +50-200ms per query
   - Quality improvement: ~10% better MRR at best
   - Cost: More infrastructure, more complexity

### When Re-Ranking Would Help

- Users report: "The answer is there but not at the top"
- MRR drops significantly in production
- Expanding to much larger, noisier corpus
- Precision more important than recall (strict mode)

### For This Dataset

- Don't implement
- Baseline already optimal
- Monitor in production
- Reconsider only if evidence emerges

#7: 0.54 - Logging Config
#8: 0.48 - Security Guide
#9: 0.41 - Backup Procedures
#10: 0.38 - Installation Guide
```

**With Threshold 0.7 (High Confidence):**
```
#1: 0.89 - Query Optimization ✓ SHOW
#2: 0.84 - PostgreSQL Tips ✓ SHOW
#3: 0.78 - Indexing Guide ✓ SHOW
#4: 0.72 - SQL Best Practices ✓ SHOW
(#5-10 all < 0.7, hidden)
```

**With Threshold 0.5 (Balanced):**
```
#1: 0.89 - Query Optimization ✓ SHOW
#2: 0.84 - PostgreSQL Tips ✓ SHOW
#3: 0.78 - Indexing Guide ✓ SHOW

#5: 0.68 - Connection Pooling ✓ SHOW
#6: 0.61 - Debugging Tools ✓ SHOW (borderline)
(#7-10 all < 0.5, hidden)
```

### Recommended Thresholds

| Use Case | Threshold | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Strict/Production** | 0.70 | Only high-confidence answers needed | Customer support Q&A |
| **Balanced/Default** | 0.50 | Good mix of precision + recall | General search |
| **Exploratory/Research** | 0.30 | Cast wide net, human reviews results | Research, discovery |
| **No Threshold** | None | Return top N regardless | "What's available on this topic?" |

### Tuning in Production

**Start Here:**
```bash
rag search "query" --limit 10  # No threshold
```

**If Too Many False Positives:**
```bash
rag search "query" --limit 10 --threshold 0.7
```

**If Missing Relevant Results:**
```bash
rag search "query" --limit 20 --threshold 0.3
```

**Monitor Metrics:**
- Recall: How many relevant docs are found?
- Precision: What % of results are relevant?
- MRR: Where does first relevant doc appear?

## Recommendations by Use Case

### Recommendation 1: General Search

**Configuration:**
```bash
rag search "your query" --collection docs --limit 10
```

**Threshold:** None (return top 10)

**Why:** Good balance between recall and simplicity

### Recommendation 2: Fact-Finding (High Precision)

**Configuration:**
```bash
rag search "specific fact" --collection docs --limit 5 --threshold 0.7
```

**Threshold:** 0.7

**Why:** Only show high-confidence matches

### Recommendation 3: Topic Exploration

**Configuration:**
```bash
rag search "topic" --collection docs --limit 20 --threshold 0.3
```

**Threshold:** 0.3

**Why:** Broad results for discovery

### Recommendation 4: MCP Agent Usage

**Configuration:**
```python
search_documents(
    query=user_query,
    collection_name="my-docs",
    limit=10,  # Top 10
    threshold=0.5  # Balanced
)
```

**Why:** Agents benefit from broad but filtered results

## Performance Benchmarking

### How We Tested

**Methodology:**
1. 20 test queries
2. Record all results with similarity scores
3. Manual labeling: relevant or not relevant
4. Calculate: Recall@5, Precision@5, MRR, nDCG@10
5. Compare three approaches

**Metrics Calculated:**

**Recall@5:** Did top 5 include a relevant doc?
```
Recall@5 = (# relevant docs in top 5) / (# total relevant docs)
```

**Precision@5:** How many of top 5 were relevant?
```
Precision@5 = (# relevant docs in top 5) / 5
```

**MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank):** Position of first relevant doc
```
MRR = Average(1 / rank_of_first_relevant_doc)
```

**nDCG@10:** Ranked quality of top 10
```
nDCG@10 = DCG@10 / IDCG@10
Incorporates both presence and ranking quality
```

### Running Benchmarks

**CLI (if available):**
