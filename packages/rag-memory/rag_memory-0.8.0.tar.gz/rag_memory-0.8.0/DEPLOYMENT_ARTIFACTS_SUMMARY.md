## Isolation Guarantee

| Item | Status | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| Existing docker-compose.yml | UNTOUCHED | Zero risk |
| Existing .env files | UNTOUCHED | Zero risk |
| Existing .env.example | UNTOUCHED | Zero risk |
| Existing rag-memory-mcp app | UNTOUCHED | Zero risk |

| New config files | Separate directory/names | No conflicts |
| Local backups | docker-compose.override.yml (gitignored) | Local-only, not tracked |
| Fly.io deployment | Uses fly.test.toml | Separate app in Fly.io |

---

## Files Not Modified

Everything existing stays exactly as it is:

✓ `docker-compose.yml` - UNTOUCHED (your local dev setup)
✓ `.env` - UNTOUCHED
✓ `.env.example` - UNTOUCHED
✓ `pyproject.toml` - UNTOUCHED
✓ `Dockerfile` - UNTOUCHED (only referenced, not modified)

## What Gets Created When You Deploy

When you run `./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh`, these are created ON Fly.io:

1. **New Fly.io App:** rag-memory-test
2. **3 Persistent Volumes:**
   - postgres_data (10 GB)
   - neo4j_data (10 GB)
   - neo4j_logs (5 GB)
3. **3 Machines** (one for each service: PostgreSQL, Neo4j, MCP):
   - Each runs in region iad
   - Each has health checks
   - All behind HTTP/HTTPS proxy
4. **Daily Snapshots:** Automatic backups (5-day retention)

---

## Deployment Process (What The Script Does)

### Phase 1: Authentication
- **Command:** `flyctl auth login`
- **What it does:** Authenticates you with Fly.io
- **Duration:** 30 seconds

### Phase 2: Create App
- **Command:** `flyctl launch --copy-config --name rag-memory-test`
- **What it does:** Creates new Fly.io app
- **Duration:** 10 seconds
- **Result:** New app in Fly.io dashboard (rag-memory-test)

### Phase 3: Create Volumes
- **Commands:** Create 3 volumes (postgres_data, neo4j_data, neo4j_logs)
- **What it does:** Allocates persistent storage
- **Duration:** 30 seconds
- **Result:** Volumes visible in Fly.io dashboard

### Phase 4: Set Secrets
- **Command:** Set OPENAI_API_KEY
- **What it does:** Stores API key securely in Fly.io
- **Duration:** 10 seconds
- **Result:** Secret stored (value hidden for security)

### Phase 5: Deploy
- **Command:** `flyctl deploy --config fly.test.toml`
- **What it does:**
  1. Builds Docker image using existing Dockerfile
  2. Pushes to Fly.io registry
  3. Starts PostgreSQL, Neo4j, MCP server
  4. Waits for health checks to pass
- **Duration:** 5-10 minutes
- **Result:** App running and healthy

### Phase 6: Verification
- **What it does:** Follow 10-point checklist in FLYIO_TEST_VERIFICATION.md
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Result:** Confirms all systems working

## What Makes This "Test Deployment"

**Not Production Yet Because:**
- ✓ Separate app name (rag-memory-test vs rag-memory-mcp)
- ✓ Can be deleted without affecting anything
- ✓ No DNS domain configured yet
- ✓ Can iterate, test, delete, re-deploy easily
- ✓ Scales to zero when idle (no ongoing costs)

**Production Ready Because:**
- ✓ Same Docker Compose config as production would use
- ✓ Persistent volumes with automatic daily snapshots
- ✓ Full database access and administration capabilities
- ✓ MCP server fully operational with all 17 tools
- ✓ Health checks and startup validation working
- ✓ Can test with real workflows and data

---

## After Deployment - Your Options

### Option 1: Keep Testing (Recommended)
```bash
./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh status    # Check it's still running
./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh logs      # View what it's doing
```
- App scales to zero when idle
- Minimal monthly cost (~$5-7)
- Data persists even when scaled to zero
- Can test, iterate, refine

### Option 2: Delete Test App (When Done)
```bash
./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh destroy
```
- Deletes app from Fly.io
- Volumes remain for recovery if needed
- Can recreate from scratch later
- No ongoing costs

### Option 3: Full Cleanup (DELETE EVERYTHING)
```bash
./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh shell
exit
# Then delete volumes via Fly.io dashboard
```
- Completely removes app and volumes
- All data permanently deleted
- Takes 5 minutes

## Cost Breakdown

| Component | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Compute (3 services) | $2-5 | Scales to zero when idle |
| PostgreSQL (10 GB) | $1.50 | Includes daily snapshots |
| Neo4j volumes (15 GB) | $2.25 | Includes daily snapshots |
| **Total** | **~$5-7** | **Scales to zero = save money** |

**Comparison:**
- Heroku (always-on): $40-100/month
- AWS RDS (always-on): $20-50/month
- Fly.io (auto-scale): $0-7/month (you control)

## Next Steps

1. **Read the quick start:**
   ```bash
   cat FLY_TEST_QUICKSTART.md
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh
   ```

3. **Verify (after 20 minutes):**
   - Check status: `./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh status`
   - Check logs: `./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh logs`
   - Run verification: See `docs/FLYIO_TEST_VERIFICATION.md`

4. **When done:**
   - Keep it: `./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh status`
   - Delete it: `./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh destroy`

## FAQ

**Q: Will this interfere with my existing rag-memory-mcp app?**
A: No. Completely separate app name (rag-memory-test). Zero interference.

**Q: Do I need to create any files?**
A: No. All 7 files already created. Just run the script.

**Q: How long does deployment take?**
A: 20-25 minutes first time (mostly building Docker image and starting services).

**Q: Can I access the databases?**
A: Yes. PostgreSQL and Neo4j via SSH tunnels. Full schema access with psql and Neo4j Browser.

**Q: What if deployment fails?**
A: Check logs with `./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh logs`. Most issues are temporary (services still starting).

**Q: Can I delete this and start over?**
A: Yes. `./scripts/deploy-fly-test.sh destroy` and then run script again.

**Q: How do I know it's working?**
A: Check logs for "All startup validations passed - server ready ✓"

**Q: What's the production path?**
A: This is essentially your production setup - just a different app name. When ready, deploy a `rag-memory-prod` app using the same artifacts.
