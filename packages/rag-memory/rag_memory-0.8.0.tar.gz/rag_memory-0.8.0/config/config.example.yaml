# RAG Memory Configuration Template
#
# This file shows the structure of config files for different environments.
# Copy this to config.dev.yaml or config.test.yaml and fill in your values.
#
# NOTE: Secrets like OPENAI_API_KEY should come from environment variables,
# not from this file. This allows config files to be safely source-controlled.
