* Implement machine complex numbers, using in particular src/c_poly.C for root finding

* Implement balls of complex numbers, based on mpc, with a real radius

* Implement root finding for polynomials with interval coefficients
this seems actually inexistent in all available libraries.

* Implement mixed-precision root finding
start by fast routine, using few bits from the coefficients to get approximate roots, use high precision at the end.
