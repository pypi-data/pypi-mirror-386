use crate::helpers::common::{mean_f, var_f};

/// Variance of window meansâ€”how stable the level of the series is.
///
/// # What it does
/// - Chops the series into windows of length `freq` (or 10 when `freq` is `Some(1)` or `None`).
/// - Computes the mean of each window after dropping NaNs.
/// - Returns the sample variance of those means, yielding `0.0` when fewer than two windows remain.
///
/// # In simple terms
/// 1. Average each block of observations.
/// 2. Compare how those averages move across the series.
/// 3. Return 0 for a flat level, larger numbers for drifting means.
///
/// # Why it matters
/// - **Trend vs. level**: Complements lumpiness by focusing on shifts in mean rather than variance.
/// - **Model diagnostics**: Helps pick between mean-stationary vs. drifting models.
/// - **Feature parity**: Matches the TSFeatures "stability" feature used in forecasting toolkits.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `x`: Time-series samples.
/// - `freq`: Seasonal period; uses 10 when it is 1 or missing.
///
/// # Returns
/// Sample variance of window means, or `0.0` when the series is too short to form multiple windows.
