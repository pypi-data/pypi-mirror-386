# 🌀 SaLangDev — The Simple Abstract Language for Developers

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Author:** *Salman Fareed Chishty*
**License:** MIT
**Extension:** `.salangdev`

---

## 📖 Introduction

**SaLangDev (Simple Abstract Language for Developers)** is a lightweight and beginner-friendly programming language designed to show **how interpreters and languages work internally**.

Built entirely in **Python**, SaLangDev lets you write small programs using **human-friendly commands** instead of traditional syntax.

The purpose of SaLangDev is **education**, **experimentation**, and **inspiration** — a great tool for learning the basics of language design and execution.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **Custom Syntax:** Write programs using commands like `digit`, `letters`, and `outcome`.
✅ **Python-Powered Execution:** SaLangDev converts your code into Python and runs it instantly.
✅ **No Dependencies:** 100% pure Python — just install and run.
✅ **.salangdev File Support:** Run your own `.salangdev` scripts directly from the terminal.
✅ **Extensible:** Add new keywords or grammar rules easily.

## 🧠 SaLangDev Syntax

| SaLangDev Keyword | Meaning / Python Equivalent |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| `digit`           | `int` (integer values)      |
| `one_letter`      | `char` (single character)   |
| `letters`         | `str` (string type)         |
| `outcome`         | `print()` function          |
| `+ - * /`         | Same as Python operators    |
| `=`               | Assignment operator         |
| `#`               | Comment indicator           |

---

## 💡 Example Program

```salangdev
# SaLangDev Example
digit x = 10
letters name = "Salman"

outcome("Welcome to SaLangDev!")
outcome(name)
outcome(x + 5)
```

### Output:

```
Welcome to SaLangDev!
Salman
15
```

---

## ⚙️ Installation

You can install SaLangDev directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/salangdev/) using:

```bash
pip install salangdev
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Create a new file:

```bash
nano test.salangdev
```

Write:

```salangdev
outcome("Hello from SaLangDev!")
```

Then run it:

```bash
salangdev test.salangdev
```

Output:

```
Hello from SaLangDev!
```

---

## 🧩 Supported Data Types

| Type Keyword | Description      | Example                     |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| `digit`      | Integer values   | `digit age = 25`            |
| `letters`    | Strings or text  | `letters msg = "Hi there!"` |
| `one_letter` | Single character | `one_letter grade = 'A'`    |

## 🔍 Internal Working

When you execute a `.salangdev` file, the interpreter:

1. Reads the file line by line.
2. Replaces SaLangDev keywords with their Python equivalents.
3. Runs the translated Python code.

For example:

```
digit x = 5
outcome(x)
```

Internally becomes:

```python
x = int(5)
print(x)
```

## 🧑‍💻 Development & Contribution

Contributions are welcome! You can:

* Add new keywords like `repeat`, `loop`, or `if`
* Improve parsing logic
* Add error handling and debugging
* Extend the runtime

To contribute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/salangdev
cd salangdev
pip install -e .
```

Then test:

```bash
salangdev examples/hello.salangdev
```

## 🧰 Future Roadmap

🚧 Planned Features:

* Control structures (`if`, `loop`)
* String concatenation and interpolation
* File I/O support
* Error tracking and debugging mode
* Graphical editor for SaLangDev programs
