# InsuranceTypeService.py
"""
InsuranceTypeService

Phase 2 scaffolding for future direct SBR09 extraction from API (GraphQL Super Connector).

- NOT ACTIVE: This module provides structure and validation only; integration is disabled
  until the API provides the SBR09 code directly and the key name is known.
- Usage intent: When feature flag 'use_sbr09_direct_from_api' is enabled and the
  GraphQL API returns an SBR09-compatible code in a known field, call the centralized
  MediCafe.graphql_utils.extract_sbr09_direct() and use the returned value directly
  after minimal validation (no internal mapping).

Implementation notes:
- Extraction and validation are centralized in MediCafe/graphql_utils.py to avoid duplication
  and allow reuse across MediLink and MediBot.
