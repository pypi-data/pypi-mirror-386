"""MediBot_Charges.py

Overview
--------
This module provides helper functions for MediBot.py to calculate and bundle charges for entry into Medisoft, based on patient data from MediBot (e.g., full patient details plus user-input anesthesia minutes). It focuses on ophthalmology clinics performing cataract surgeries, where patients typically undergo procedures on both eyes as separate events but require price bundling for consistent billing. Charges are generally calculated as piecewise step-functions based on anesthesia minutes (aligned with 837p units/minutes), exhibiting linear mx+b behavior.

The module enriches patient data for backend use in MediBot.py, potentially including flags/tags for billing readiness (e.g., indicating prior surgeries, calculated charges, or bundling status). It does not handle UI display directly—that's for MediBot_UI.py or similar. Output feeds into MediLink for generating 837p files; consider enriching data in 837p-compatible format (e.g., Loop syntax for charges/minutes) for easier conversion to human-readable UI. See MediLink_Charges_Integration_Analysis.md for integration details and safety considerations.

Key Features
------------
- Supports batch processing of up to 200 patients (typical: ~20), though serial processing is preferred for user input. Add a "save partial" flag to mitigate risks of inconsistent enriched data if batch fails midway.
- Implements price bundling to balance charges across multiple procedures (e.g., both eyes), ensuring even total costs per eye to meet patient expectations. Bundling is not affected by unmet deductibles (which instead flag claims as Pending for Deductible to delay sending).
- Flags "bundling_pending" by defaulting to expect a second procedure within 30 days from first date of service (process refund if expired). Speculate partly on diagnosis codes (e.g., ICD-10 H25.xx for bilateral cataracts), but note variability (e.g., glaucoma in one eye or prior surgery elsewhere) makes this imperfect—err on expecting return visits.
- Uses tiered pricing schedules from MediLink_Charges.py (loaded via configuration or defaults):
  - Private insurance:
    - $450 for 1-15 minutes
    - $540 for 16-34 minutes
    - $580 for 35-59 minutes (maximum allowed duration; cap at 59 if exceeded)
  - Medicare: Placeholder tiers (e.g., $300 for 1-30, $350 for 31-45, $400 for 46-59); override via configuration if different from private.
- Integrates with historical transaction data (e.g., via MediSoft's MATRAN file, details TBD) for lookups, especially for patients with prior surgeries to support bundling. Never alters MATRAN data—print user notifications for any needed modifications (e.g., "Edit MATRAN for Patient ID: [ID] - Adjust prior charge from [old] to [new] for bundling"). For MediCafe-owned records, adjustments are fine.

Limitations and Assumptions
---------------------------
- Bundling for commercial insurance depends on deductibles, claim submission timing (e.g., within 90 days of service), refund timing, and policy conditions. This is not fully specified but aims to minimize patient invoices due to non-payment risks post-surgery. Unmet deductibles flag claims but do not alter bundling.
- Does not synchronize perfectly with procedure timing (date of service) or insurance events; bundling may fail if conditions like deductibles are unmet. Over-flagging "bundling_pending" could lead to unnecessary prep—monitor via logs.
- Assumes serial processing: User inputs minutes per patient, module enriches data, repeat. Batch processing is inefficient without all data (e.g., minutes) available upfront. If batch fails midway, use "save partial" flag for recovery; no automatic rollback.
- Medicare handling uses placeholders; assumes similarity to private insurance unless configured otherwise.
- For missing historical data: Notify user (print, similar to MAINS failures; minimal logging to avoid DEBUG/INFO clutter [[memory:4184036]]), use any existing first/second visit data; prompt manually if none available (e.g., display table-like line from enhanced patient table, user fills 'minutes' column, line progresses with added charges and pre-loaded deductible data if available).
- For durations >59 minutes: Cap at 59, log minimal INFO warning (no HIPAA data), and print notify for user confirmation (rare case, likely typo).
- No direct risk to existing functionality, but bundling logic could affect billing accuracy if assumptions about insurance conditions are incorrect (e.g., over-bundling risks claim rejections; user errors in manual MATRAN edits could break audits if notifications aren't precise).

Usage
-----
Intended as a data enricher for MediBot.py to automate Medisoft charge entry. Example flow:
1. Receive patient data from MediBot.py.
2. User inputs anesthesia minutes (possibly via enhanced patient table in MediBot_UI.py; extend display_enhanced_patient_table() with serial pauses/prompts).
3. Enrich data with calculated/bundled charges, flags (e.g., bundling_pending, Pending for Deductible), and 837p-compatible fields.
4. Pass enriched data back for MediSoft entry or 837p generation. For prior billed charges, lookup without alteration; notify user for manual MATRAN edits if needed.

Integration Notes
-----------------
- Integrate with MediBot_UI.py for displaying an enhanced patient table, user input for minutes (table-like prompts where user fills 'minutes' column, line progresses), and historical lookups (e.g., for prior charges in bundling). Handle UI pauses serially; use "save partial" flag on errors.
- Run serially per patient for real-time enrichment during input.
- Future: Specify how to display bundled charges in UI and handle MATRAN file parsing for transactions (read-only).

Compatibility
-------------
Always ensure XP SP3 + Python 3.4.4 + ASCII-only environment compatibility. Avoid f-strings and include inline commentary where assumptions may differ (e.g., Medicare handling).

Note: This module is a helper; place any additional helper functions in a separate .py file per preferences.
