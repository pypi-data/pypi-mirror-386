# Evo Object API Client

The Geoscience Object API is Seequent's next-generation cloud offering for geoscience
data, empowering our users to build responsive modern workflows. 

## Pre-requisites

* Python ^3.10
* An [application registered in Bentley](https://developer.bentley.com/register/?product=seequent-evo)

## Installation

```shell
pip install evo-objects
```

## Usage

See [the evo-sdk-common documentation](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-python-sdk/blob/main/packages/evo-sdk-common/README.md)
for information on how to authenticate, then select the organisation, hub and workspace that you would like to use.

### Interacting with the Geoscience Object API

To get up and running quickly with the Evo Objects SDK, start by configuring your
[environment and API connector](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-python-sdk/blob/main/packages/evo-sdk-common/docs/quickstart.md).

```python
from evo.objects import ObjectAPIClient

service_client = ObjectAPIClient(environment, connector)
service_health = await service_client.get_service_health()
service_health.raise_for_status()

# The data client is an optional utility that provides helpers for uploading and downloading
# parquet data via pyarrow.Table objects.
data_client = service_client.get_data_client(manager.cache)
...
```

Listing objects is simple, just call the `ObjectAPIClient.list_objects()` method.

```python
offset = 0
while True:
    page = await service_client.list_objects(offset=offset, limit=10)
    if offset == 0:
        print(f"Found {page.total} object{'' if page.total == 1 else 's'}")
    for object in page:
        print(f"{object.path}: <{object.schema_id}> ({object.id})")

    if page.is_last:
        break
    else:
        offset = page.next_offset
```

You can also get a list of all objects. Internally, this recursively calls the `list_objects()` method until all objects are fetched.

Check out the other methods on the `ObjectAPIClient` for more details on how to upload and download objects, or get object versions.
