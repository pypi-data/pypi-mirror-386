# Evo Compute Task Client

The Compute Task API provides the ability to execute computation tasks in Evo that require variable, on-demand processing power. Building the Compute Task API into your application can enable fast processing of long running, or resource intensive operations, without depending on the end user's physical hardware.

Tasks are created, triggering a job to be executed asynchronously within a specific topic for your organization, and can be monitored throughout their execution lifecycle.

## Pre-requisites

* Python ^3.10
* An [application registered in Bentley](https://developer.bentley.com/register/?product=seequent-evo)

## Installation

```shell
pip install evo-compute
```

## Usage

See [the evo-sdk-common documentation](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-python-sdk/blob/main/packages/evo-sdk-common/README.md)
for information on how to authenticate, then select the organisation, hub and workspace that you would like to use.

### Interacting with the Compute Task API

To get up and running quickly with the Evo Compute Task SDK, start by configuring your
[environment and API connector](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-python-sdk/blob/main/packages/evo-sdk-common/docs/quickstart.md).

For some interactive Jupyter notebook examples, see the [examples folder](docs/examples).
