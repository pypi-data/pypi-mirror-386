# Evo File API Client

The File API provides the ability to manage files of any type or size, associated with your Evo workspace.
Enable your product with Evo connected workflows by integrating with the Seequent Evo File API. Most file
formats and sizes are accepted.

## Pre-requisites

* Python ^3.10
* An [application registered in Bentley](https://developer.bentley.com/register/?product=seequent-evo)

## Installation

```shell
pip install evo-files 
```

## Usage

To get up and running quickly with the Evo File SDK, start by configuring your
[environment and API connector](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-python-sdk/blob/main/packages/evo-sdk-common/docs/quickstart.md).

You can then use the `FileAPIClient` to perform operations, for example:

```python
from evo.files import FileAPIClient

file_client = FileAPIClient(environment, connector)
files = await file_client.list_files()
```

For some interactive Jupyter notebook examples, see the [examples folder](docs/examples).
