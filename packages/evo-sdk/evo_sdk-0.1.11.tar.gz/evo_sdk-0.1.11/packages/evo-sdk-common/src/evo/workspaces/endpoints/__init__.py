Workspaces API
=============

The Workspaces API enables users to organize, maintain, and store project data, but does not use or process the data. The workspace APIs allow you to manage:
- Workspaces
- User roles within workspaces
- Workspace thumbnails

There are three pre-defined roles within workspaces:

- Owner: can perform all actions in the workspace
- Editor: can perform all actions excluding deleting of a workspace
- Viewer: can view the workspace

These user roles can be assigned to users in a workspace. Once a role has been assigned it can be replaced or removed.
Users can also retrieve user roles, the role of a particular user, and their own role if applicable.
For more information on using the Workspaces API, see the [Workspaces API overview](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/workspaces/), or the API references here.
