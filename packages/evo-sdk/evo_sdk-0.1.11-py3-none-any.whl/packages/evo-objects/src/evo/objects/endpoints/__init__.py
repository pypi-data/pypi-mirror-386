Geoscience Object API
=============


The Geoscience Object API enables technological integrations at the object level. It enables users to access and utilise their data across all products through a common and accessible data structure.

A Geoscience Object is a data structure that represents a concrete geological, geotechnical, or geophysical concept. Geoscience Objects can be referenced by their UUID or by a user-defined object path.

For more information on using the Geoscience Object API, see the [Geoscience Object API overview](/docs/guides/objects), or the API references here.
