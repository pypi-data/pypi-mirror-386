# Evo SDK Common

Evo SDK Common is a Python package that establishes a common framework for use by client libraries that interact
with Seequent Evo APIs. It can also be used to power arbitrary API requests to Seequent Evo APIs, where an existing
client SDK may not exist yet.

## Pre-requisites

* Python ^3.10
* An [application registered in Bentley](https://developer.bentley.com/register/?product=seequent-evo)

## Installation

```shell
pip install evo-sdk-common
```

To use the SDK within a Jupyter notebook, include the `notebooks` optional dependency:

```shell
pip install evo-sdk-common[notebooks]
```

## Usage

See the [Getting Started](docs/quickstart.md) guide to learn how to use this library. There is more detailed information about authentication options in the [OAuth examples](docs/oauth.md), and a selection of interactive Jupyter notebooks in the [examples folder](docs/examples).

Here's a small example from the [Getting Started](docs/quickstart.md) guide showing to use `evo-sdk-common` to list the
organizations you have access to:

```python
from evo.aio import AioTransport
from evo.oauth import OAuthConnector, AuthorizationCodeAuthorizer
from evo.discovery import DiscoveryAPIClient
from evo.common import APIConnector
import asyncio

transport = AioTransport(user_agent="Your Application Name")
connector = OAuthConnector(transport=transport, client_id="<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>")
authorizer = AuthorizationCodeAuthorizer(oauth_connector=connector, redirect_url="http://localhost:3000/signin-callback")

async def main():
    await authorizer.login()
    await discovery()

async def discovery():
    async with APIConnector("https://discover.api.seequent.com", transport, authorizer) as api_connector:
        discovery_client = DiscoveryAPIClient(api_connector)
        organizations = await discovery_client.list_organizations()
        print("Organizations:", organizations)

asyncio.run(main())
```
