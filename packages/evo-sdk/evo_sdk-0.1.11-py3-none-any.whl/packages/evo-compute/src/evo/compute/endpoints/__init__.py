Compute Task API
=============

Normally this code would be generated from an OpenAPI specification. However, the API specification for
the Compute Task API is new and not yet finalized. Therefore, this code is written against the intended API,
with some customisation as needed to make it work.

The client implementation should still abstract these details away from the user, so that the user can interact
with the API in a more user-friendly way, and so that this implementation can be changed without affecting the user.

This code is based on the OpenAPI specification for Compute Task API.
API version: 0.0.1
