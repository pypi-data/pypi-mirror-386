Block Model API
=============


    The Block Model API provides the ability to manage and report on block models in your Evo workspaces. Enable your
    product with Evo connected workflows by integrating with the Seequent Block Model API.

    The Block Model API supports a range of sub-blocking options, and both full and partial updates to block models,
    including updates of specified columns and/or sub-volumes. Block models are versioned, and the service supports
    reporting on the material content of current or previous versions, and comparing the content between versions of
    a block model.

    For more information on the Block Model API, see [Overview](/docs/blockmodel/overview), or the API references here.
