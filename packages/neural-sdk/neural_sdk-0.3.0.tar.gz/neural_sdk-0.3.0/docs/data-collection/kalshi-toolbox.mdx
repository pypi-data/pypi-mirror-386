The fastest way to explore sports markets is to start with the REST helper and then lean on the convenience coroutines in `neural.data_collection.kalshi` for sport-specific enrichment.

## Grab a batch of markets

```python
import pandas as pd
from neural.auth.http_client import KalshiHTTPClient

client = KalshiHTTPClient()
try:
    payload = client.get(
        "/markets",
        params={"series_ticker": "KXNFLGAME", "status": "open", "limit": 200}
    )
finally:
    client.close()

markets = pd.DataFrame(payload.get("markets", []))
print(markets[["ticker", "title", "yes_ask", "no_ask"]].head())
```

Everything that follows starts from this DataFrameâ€”join in sentiment, export to CSV, or hand it to a strategy.

## Sport-focused helpers

The module `neural.data_collection.kalshi` includes a few async helpers that add parsed metadata:

| Helper | What it returns |
|--------|-----------------|
| `get_nfl_games(...)` | NFL markets with `home_team`, `away_team`, and parsed `game_date`. |
| `get_cfb_games(...)` | NCAA football markets with similar enrichments. |

```python
import asyncio
from neural.data_collection.kalshi import get_nfl_games

async def upcoming_games():
    nfl = await get_nfl_games(limit=25)
    print(nfl[["ticker", "away_team", "home_team", "game_date"]])

asyncio.run(upcoming_games())
```

## Feed an aggregator

Once you know the series or event ticker you care about, stream richer context with the multi-source aggregator:

```python
from neural.data_collection.aggregator import MultiSourceAggregator, SourceConfig

aggregator = MultiSourceAggregator(
    game_id="KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI",
    teams=["Seattle Seahawks", "Arizona Cardinals"],
    kalshi_config={"series_ticker": "KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI"},
    twitter_config=SourceConfig(poll_interval=45.0),
)
```

Subscribe handlers (`aggregator.data_handlers`) to capture combined market, sentiment, and play-by-play updates as they happen.

## Summary checklist

1. Use `KalshiHTTPClient` for quick ad-hoc pulls or scripts (`examples/build_first_bot.py` does exactly this).
2. Reach for the sport helpers when you need pre-parsed teams and dates.
3. Graduate to `MultiSourceAggregator` for synchronized market + context streams.
4. Keep `data-collection/ticker-patterns` handy to decode any odd ticker you bump into.
