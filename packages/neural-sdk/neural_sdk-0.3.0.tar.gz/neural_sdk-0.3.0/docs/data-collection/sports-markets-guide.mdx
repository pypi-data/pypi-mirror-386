Use the authenticated REST helper to list sports markets quickly:

```python
import pandas as pd
from neural.auth.http_client import KalshiHTTPClient

client = KalshiHTTPClient()
try:
    payload = client.get(
        "/markets",
        params={"series_ticker": "KXNFLGAME", "status": "open", "limit": 25}
    )
finally:
    client.close()

markets = pd.DataFrame(payload.get("markets", []))
print(f"Found {len(markets)} NFL markets")
print(markets[["ticker", "title"]].head())
```

**Tips:**

- Responses are plain dictionaries, ready for `pandas`, JSON export, or transformation pipelines.
- Combine with the ticker quick tips (`data-collection/ticker-patterns`) to filter for exact games or props.
- For continuous monitoring, switch to `RESTStreamingClient` or `KalshiWebSocketClient` (see `trading/market-data`).
