title: 'Analysis Stack Overview'
description: 'Purpose, entry points, and quick checks for Neural’s strategy layer.'
---

## Purpose
Translate raw market data into executable decisions. The analysis stack manages strategies, backtests, risk, and order hand-off so you can concentrate on signal design.

## When to use it
- You have market data from `neural.data_collection` and need to generate trades.
- You want to replay an idea on historical data before running it live.
- You need reusable risk sizing, sentiment scoring, or an order bridge.

## Key modules

| Module | What it covers | Docs |
|--------|----------------|------|
| `neural.analysis.strategies` | Base class + prebuilt strategies (mean reversion, momentum, arbitrage, sentiment) | `analysis/strategy-foundations`, `analysis/strategy-library` |
| `neural.analysis.backtesting` | Event-driven backtester with fee/slippage modelling and optional ESPN integration | `analysis/backtesting` |
| `neural.analysis.risk.position_sizing` | Kelly, fixed-percentage, edge-proportional, martingale helpers | `analysis/risk-sizing` |
| `neural.analysis.execution.order_manager` | Bridges strategy signals to trading clients (live or paper) | `analysis/order-management` |
| `neural.analysis.sentiment` | Twitter/ESPN sentiment engines and trackers | `analysis/sentiment` |

## Inputs
- `pandas.DataFrame` market snapshots (YES/NO prices, volume, timestamps).
- Optional context (ESPN play-by-play, sentiment metrics, sportsbook lines).
- Strategy configuration parameters (edges, thresholds, stop losses, etc.).

## Outputs
- `Signal` and `Position` objects routed to paper or live execution.
- `BacktestResult` summaries (total return, Sharpe, drawdown, trade logs).
- Risk metrics (exposure, Kelly sizing, anti-/martingale adjustments).

## Quick check (five lines)

```python
from neural.analysis.strategies.mean_reversion import MeanReversionStrategy
from neural.analysis.backtesting.engine import Backtester

strategy = MeanReversionStrategy(initial_capital=10_000)
engine = Backtester(initial_capital=10_000)
# Plug in your historical DataFrame: engine.backtest(strategy, start_date, end_date, markets)
```

If that snippet imports cleanly, your environment is set up and you can dive into the strategy docs linked above.

## Connect it to the rest of the stack
1. Collect live or historical data (`data-collection/overview`).
2. Feed it into your strategy (`analysis/strategy-foundations`).
3. Backtest and tweak risk settings (`analysis/backtesting`, `analysis/risk-sizing`).
4. Send resulting signals to the appropriate execution surface (`trading/overview`).

Keep this page handy as a hub—every other analysis doc branches from the modules listed here.
