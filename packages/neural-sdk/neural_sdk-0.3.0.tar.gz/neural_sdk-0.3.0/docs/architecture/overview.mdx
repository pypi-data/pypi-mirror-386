description: Neural architecture and module layout
---

Neural provides a clean, modular architecture to build trading systems on prediction markets. The platform is organized into three stacks:

## Stacks

### 1) Data Collection (`neural.data_collection`)

Purpose: Collect historical and real-time market data
Includes:
- Kalshi REST helpers and authenticated clients
- Streaming adapters (REST polling, WebSocket)
- Transformers, registries, and the multi-source aggregator

**Example:**

```python
from neural.auth.http_client import KalshiHTTPClient

client = KalshiHTTPClient()
markets = client.get("/markets", params={"series_ticker": "KXNFLGAME", "status": "open", "limit": 5})
client.close()
```

### 2) Analysis (`neural.analysis`)

Purpose: Research, backtest, risk, and execution modelling
Includes:
- Strategy base class and presets
- Backtester with fee/slippage modelling
- Position sizing helpers and sentiment toolkit
- Order manager bridge

**Example:**

```python
from neural.analysis.strategies.mean_reversion import MeanReversionStrategy
from neural.analysis.backtesting.engine import Backtester

strategy = MeanReversionStrategy(initial_capital=10_000)
engine = Backtester(initial_capital=10_000)
# engine.backtest(strategy, start_date="2023-01-01", end_date="2023-02-01", markets=[...])
```

### 3) Trading (`neural.trading`)

Purpose: Execute orders with production-ready clients
Includes:
- `TradingClient` (REST), `KalshiWebSocketClient`, and FIX connectors
- Paper trading simulators and reporting helpers
- Streaming market data adapters

**Example:**

```python
from neural.trading.paper_client import PaperTradingClient

paper = PaperTradingClient(initial_capital=10_000, save_trades=False)
# await paper.place_order(market_id="KXNFLGAME-â€¦", side="yes", quantity=25)
```

## Design Principles

- Clear public APIs via `__all__` exports in each package
- Environment-first credential loading with helpful errors
- Optional dependencies are imported lazily so partial installs never crash the SDK
- Integration tests skip gracefully when credentials are absent for reliable CI

Keep this mental model handy and jump to `architecture/start-here` or `workflows/build-first-bot` for the end-to-end orientation.
