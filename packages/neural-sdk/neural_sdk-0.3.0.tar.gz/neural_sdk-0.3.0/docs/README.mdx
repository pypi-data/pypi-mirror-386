## What is Neural?

Neural is an algorithmic trading platform that allows users to build algorithms to trade sports contracts on the Kalshi platform.

Making money in sports is incredibly difficult for several reasons:

**Traditional Sportsbooks**: Even if you develop winning strategies, sportsbooks will ban you once you start winning consistently. This limits your ability to scale profitable strategies long-term.

**Kalshi Platform Complexity**: While Kalshi offers a legitimate marketplace for sports event contracts without the risk of being banned, trading sustainably on the platform is challenging without systematic approaches. Manual trading leads to:
- Emotional decision-making
- Inconsistent position sizing
- Missing profitable opportunities
- Lack of proper backtesting

**This is where Neural comes in.**

Neural is an algorithmic trading platform which allows users to create, backtest, trade, and deploy strategies all in one stack. Instead of manual trading or getting banned from traditional sportsbooks, you can:

- Develop systematic, data-driven strategies
- Backtest your approaches on historical data
- Execute trades programmatically with proper risk management
- Scale your operations without platform restrictions
