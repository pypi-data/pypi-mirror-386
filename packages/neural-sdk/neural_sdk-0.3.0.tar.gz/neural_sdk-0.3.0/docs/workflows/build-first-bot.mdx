title: 'Build Your First Bot'
description: 'Run a full Neural workflow from market fetch to simulated execution in under 15 minutes.'
---

This walkthrough mirrors a realistic ‚Äúhello world‚Äù for Neural. You will fetch live Kalshi markets, score them with a toy signal, route simulated orders through the paper trading stack, and learn where to plug in backtesting or live execution when you are ready.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip install "neural-sdk[trading]"`
- Kalshi API key + RSA private key (saved in `secrets/.env` exactly as described in `getting-started`)
- `pandas` (already pulled in via the trading extra)

## 1. Clone the repo (optional but convenient)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IntelIP/Neural.git
cd Neural
```

You can also install the package globally and drop the scripts wherever you prefer‚Äîthe examples use repo-relative paths for clarity.

## 2. Confirm credentials work

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' secrets/.env | xargs)
python examples/01_init_user.py
```

Expected: a JSON blob containing your Kalshi portfolio balance. A 401/403 error means the API key and private key do not match‚Äîfix this before moving on.

## 3. Fetch live markets + simulate orders

Run the bundled quickstart script end-to-end:

```bash
python examples/build_first_bot.py
```

Sample output:

```
üì° Fetching markets...
              ticker                                              title  yes_ask  no_ask  volume
0  KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI-SEA  Will the Seattle Seahawks win against ...       55      48   12345
...

üéØ Selecting candidates
  - KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI-SEA | Will the Seattle Seahawks win ... | YES $0.55 | NO $0.48

üß™ Simulating trades in paper account
[FILLED] KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI-SEA ‚Äî Will the Seattle Seahawks win ...
    yes_ask=$0.55 | no_ask=$0.48 | volume=12,345
    filled_price=$0.55

Portfolio snapshot:
  cash: 9862.50
  total_value: 10000.00
  open_positions: 1
```

What the script does:

1. Uses `KalshiHTTPClient` to call `/trade-api/v2/markets` for the NFL series.
2. Scores candidates by tightest YES/NO spread and highest volume (a toy signal you can swap out).
3. Routes BUY orders into `PaperTradingClient` so you can inspect fills, P&L, and portfolio metrics without touching real capital.

Open the file to modify parameters, change the signal logic, or flip the execution target once you are comfortable.

## 4. Backtest the idea (optional)

Use the historical helper to pull trades for any ticker your script surfaced:

```bash
python examples/test_historical_data.py
```

This creates `test_historical_trades.csv`. Load that file into a notebook or wire it straight into the `Backtester` (`analysis/backtesting`) to replay your rule on historical fills. Once you have a strategy object, swap it into the script and send its signals through `PaperTradingClient` or `OrderManager`.

## 5. Add live context (optional)

- **Sentiment / play-by-play:** configure `MultiSourceAggregator` (see `data-collection/aggregator`) to merge Twitter + ESPN feeds with the markets you are watching.
- **Real-time quotes:** replace the REST fetch with `KalshiWebSocketClient` or `RESTStreamingClient` (see `trading/market-data`).
- **Ultra-low latency execution:** swap `PaperTradingClient` for `TradingClient` or `KalshiFIXClient` once you have guardrails in place.

## 6. Production checklist

Before promoting the bot to live trading, walk through `workflows/promotion-checklist`:

1. Sensitivity test position sizing with the risk helpers.
2. Enable structured logging and alerting around fills / disconnections.
3. Dry-run continuously with paper trading while comparing to historical backtests.

## Where to go next

| Goal | Documentation |
|------|---------------|
| Design richer data pipelines | `data-collection/overview`, `workflows/data-pipeline` |
| Implement custom strategies | `analysis/strategy-foundations`, `analysis/strategy-library` |
| Understand trading surfaces | `trading/overview`, `trading/trading-client`, `trading/fix` |
| Parse sports tickers quickly | `data-collection/ticker-patterns` |

Once this quickstart feels routine, refactor the script into modules, inject your strategy, and connect `PaperTradingClient` to your alerting/monitoring stack. You now have a skeleton you can iterate on without guesswork.

## Next

- Promote the workflow to production: `workflows/promotion-checklist`
- Instrument data pipelines: `workflows/data-pipeline`
- Iterate on strategy logic: `analysis/strategy-foundations`
