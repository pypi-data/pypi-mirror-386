Quantitative feedback closes the loop on strategy development. The reporting utilities in `neural.trading.paper_report` and the aggregator sentiment metrics provide a clean starting point for dashboards or notebook analysis.

## PaperTradingReporter

```python
from neural.trading.paper_report import PaperTradingReporter

reporter = PaperTradingReporter(data_dir="paper_trading_data")
if reporter.load_data(days_back=30):
    summary = reporter.generate_performance_summary()
    print(summary["trade_metrics"], summary["pnl_metrics"])
```

Outputs include:

- Total trades, win/loss counts, win rate.
- Aggregate realized P&L, average win/loss, profit factor.
- Commission/slippage totals.
- Optional grouped stats by `strategy`, `sentiment_score`, or `confidence` when present in trade logs.

When `pandas` is available the reporter returns nested dictionaries; otherwise it falls back to a pure-Python implementation.

## Visualizations

With `matplotlib` installed the reporter can emit charts (equity curves, daily turnover, trade distribution). Use them in notebooks or export PNGs for stakeholders.

```python
if reporter.trades_data:
    reporter.plot_equity_curve(output_path="paper_trading_data/equity.png")
```

*(Implement your own helpers following the patterns in `PaperTradingReporter` to tailor charts to your metrics.)*

## Integrating Live Logs

- Feed `OrderManager.order_history` into the same format as paper trades to reuse reporting.
- Combine sentiment snapshots from `MultiSourceAggregator` with trade results to see how crowd mood correlates with P&L.

## Next Steps

Many teams persist trades to a data warehouse or run scheduled notebooks. The provided utilities aim to get you started quickly; extend them with:

1. Performance attribution by market or sport.
2. Risk analytics (exposure by outcome, drawdown depth/duration).
3. Alerting when KPIs (win rate, Sharpe, turnover) drift.

Solid reporting ensures strategies stay healthy as Kalshi microstructure changes.
