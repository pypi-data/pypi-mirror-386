title: 'FIX Order Entry'
description: 'Leverage the FIX client for ultra-low latency trading and execution reports.'
---

The FIX client is built around `neural.trading.fix.KalshiFIXClient`, an async FIX 5.0 SP2 session tailored for Kalshi order entry.

## Connecting

```python
import asyncio
from neural.trading.fix import KalshiFIXClient, FIXConnectionConfig

async def main():
    client = KalshiFIXClient(
        config=FIXConnectionConfig(heartbeat_interval=20, reset_seq_num=True),
        on_message=lambda msg: print("FIX", msg),
    )
    await client.connect(timeout=10)

asyncio.run(main())
```

- Automatically signs logon messages with your Kalshi private key (loaded via `neural.auth`).
- Supports TLS, cancel-on-disconnect, listener sessions, and settlement reports via config flags.
- Maintains heartbeats and sequence numbers, exposing `connect()`, `logout()`, and `close()` async methods.

## Sending Orders

Use `_send_message` helpers or the higher-level methods in `FIXStreamingClient` to publish `NewOrderSingle` messages. The FIX client handles signature generation for logon and tags the sequence numbers / timestamps automatically.

## Handling Messages

Pass an `on_message` callback to inspect parsed `simplefix.FixMessage` objects:

```python
def on_message(msg):
    msg_type = msg.get(35)
    if msg_type == b"8":
        print("Execution report", msg)
```

The client exposes `_send_lock` to serialize writes and internal tasks for heartbeat + reader loops. Override or extend the class if you need to persist messages or integrate with external monitoring.

## Streaming Wrapper

`FIXStreamingClient` builds on top of `KalshiFIXClient` to manage market data subscriptions and execution callbacks without dealing with raw FIX tags. See the *Market Data Streaming* page for usage examples.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Kalshi account is FIX-enabled; credentials differ from REST/WebSocket keys.
- Watch for `_logout_event` not being setâ€”this typically indicates network issues or invalid credentials.
- Adjust `heartbeat_interval` and latency thresholds (e.g., in `HighSpeedArbitrageStrategy`) to match your infrastructure.

When latency matters and you need full control over execution reports, the FIX client provides the building blocks.
