description: 'Stream Kalshi market data using WebSocket, REST polling, and FIX-based feeds.'

Neural offers multiple ways to stay on top of market moves, covering lightweight setups and full FIX connectivity.

## WebSocket Client

`KalshiWebSocketClient` wraps the Kalshi WebSocket RPC service with automatic signing and background thread management.

```python
from neural.trading import KalshiWebSocketClient

updates = []

def on_message(payload):
    updates.append(payload)

ws = KalshiWebSocketClient(on_message=on_message)
ws.connect()
ws.subscribe(["market.ticker_updates"], params={"tickers": ["KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI-SEA"]})
```

Features:

- Builds the correct WS URL based on `env`.
- Signs headers with `KalshiSigner` (loading credentials if not provided).
- Maintains connection heartbeat, logs lifecycle events, and exposes helpers for subscribe/unsubscribe flows.

## RESTStreamingClient

When WebSocket access isnâ€™t available, `RESTStreamingClient` simulates streaming by polling the authenticated REST endpoints.

```python
from neural.trading.rest_streaming import RESTStreamingClient

async def consume():
    client = RESTStreamingClient(on_market_update=lambda snap: print(snap.ticker, snap.yes_mid))
    await client.connect()
    await client.subscribe(["KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI-SEA"])
```

Highlights:

- Converts REST responses into `MarketSnapshot` objects with spreads, mids, implied probabilities, and arbitrage checks.
- Tracks price deltas and triggers `on_price_change` when moves exceed configurable thresholds.
- Prints periodic diagnostics so you can monitor polling health.

## FIX Streaming

Pair `KalshiFIXClient` with `FIXStreamingClient` for low-latency market data and execution reports.

```python
from neural.trading.fix_streaming import FIXStreamingClient

async def main():
    feed = FIXStreamingClient(on_market_data=lambda snap: print(snap.symbol, snap.mid_price))
    await feed.connect()
    await feed.subscribe("KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI-SEA")
```

- Handles FIX logon, heartbeats, and auto-reconnect.
- Converts fix messages into `MarketDataSnapshot` objects with spreads, mid prices, volume, and implied probabilities.
- Supports execution callbacks so fills hit your portfolio logic immediately.

## Choosing a Channel

| Requirement | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Simple dashboards / notebooks | `RESTStreamingClient` |
| Real-time trading bots | `KalshiWebSocketClient` |
| High-frequency strategies or large books | `FIXStreamingClient` + `KalshiFIXClient` |

Whichever route you choose, the snapshots integrate cleanly with the analysis stack and paper trading simulator.
