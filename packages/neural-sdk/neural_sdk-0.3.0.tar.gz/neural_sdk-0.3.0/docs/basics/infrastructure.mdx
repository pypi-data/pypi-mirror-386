description: 'Understand the services, protocols, and health checks behind the Neural trading stack.'

## Purpose
Summarize the external services Neural touches (REST, WebSocket, FIX), their latency expectations, and how to smoke-test each connection.

## Components

| Layer | Endpoint | Use Case | Status |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| REST API | `https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2` | Market data, account queries, order placement via `kalshi-python` | ✅ operational |
| FIX API | `fix.elections.kalshi.com:8228` | Ultra-low-latency order entry and execution reports | ✅ operational |
| WebSocket | `/trade-api/ws/v2` | Real-time market data stream | ⚠️ requires Kalshi approval |

Latency reference: REST polling at 1s intervals, FIX round-trips ~5–10 ms, WebSocket delivers pushes <100 ms once enabled.

## Quick smoke tests

```bash
# REST – balance check
python examples/01_init_user.py

# FIX – connectivity/execution (requires FIX keys)
python tests/infrastructure/test_fix_handshake.py
```

Expected REST output includes your portfolio balance. FIX scripts should print “Logon accepted” and receive heartbeats.

## Recommended pipeline (prod)

```
REST polling (baseline) ─┬─> Strategy / Aggregator ──> TradingClient
                         └─> Optional FIX stream     └─> Kalshi exchange
```

- Use REST as the canonical data source even if WebSocket/FIX are unavailable.
- Enable FIX for execution when you need sub-10 ms fills.
- Fall back to REST polling (or `RESTStreamingClient`) if WebSocket access is not granted.

## Health checklist

1. Credentials load via `neural.auth.env` at startup.
2. REST call to `/markets` succeeds with HTTP 200.
3. FIX `Logon` → `Heartbeat` loop runs without disconnects.
4. Alerting hooks capture REST timeouts, FIX disconnects, and WebSocket 403s.

## Troubleshooting

- **403 on WebSocket** – request streaming permissions from Kalshi support or keep using REST polling.
- **FIX handshake fails** – verify FIX-specific keys (different from REST key ID) and check firewall rules for port 8228.
- **REST rate limiting (429)** – the SDK retries automatically; still, back off to 2–5s polling during off-peak or when testing.
```
