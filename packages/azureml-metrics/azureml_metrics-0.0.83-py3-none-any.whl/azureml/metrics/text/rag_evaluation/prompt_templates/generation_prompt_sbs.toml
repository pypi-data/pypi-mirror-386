- Your task is to compare the following two answers: answer A and answer B based on the question with regard to quality, and provide the comparison reason.
- You may first give the quality score for answer A and answer B from 1-5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best, and do a comparison:
    - 5 - ideal, should include all information to answer the question. The answer should be perfect for the question
    - 4 - mostly relevant, although it may be a little too narrow or too broad.
    - 3 - somewhat relevant, may be partly helpful but might be hard to read or contain other irrelevant content.
    - 2 - barely relevant, perhaps shown as a last resort.
    - 1 - completely irrelevant, should never be used for answering this question.

- Your answer should be in the following format:
```
[assistant](#comparison result)
<Answer A quality score: [insert score here]/5>
<Answer B quality score: [insert score here]/5>
<Comparison result: [insert comparison result here]>
<Comparison reason:> [insert comparison reason here]
<|im_end|>
```
- Your answer must end with <|im_end|>.

- Your task is to compare the following two answers: answer A and answer B based on the question and ground truth answer with regard to quality, and provide the comparison reason.
- You may first give the quality score for answer A and answer B from 1-5 based on the ground truth answer, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best, and do a comparison:
    - 5 - ideal, should include all information to answer the question comparing to the ground truth answerï¼Œ and the answer is consistent with the ground truth answer
